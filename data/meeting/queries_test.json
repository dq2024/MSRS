However, the Project Manager disagreed, citing a potential market for parental control and the influence of televisions on children. The target group being below forty, with many families having young children, further supported this decision. During the discussion on button layout, the group encountered a challenge with certain elements being non-removable on the remote. The Industrial Designer suggested using titanium for those elements and plastic for others, but the Marketing team disagreed, believing that plastic would not give the remote a strong or satisfactory appearance. The cost of wireless technology was higher than expected, but the Industrial Designer highlighted the importance of determining user preferences through marketing research. Additionally, establishing a link between the remote control and the television was seen as a way to prevent loss of control. The Project Manager identified ease of use and ease of finding as key frustrations in remote control design, which could be turned into a competitive advantage without making the device overly complex or time-consuming to develop. The Marketing team proposed creating a remote control that doesn't resemble a traditional remote, but the Project Manager expressed concern that customers may not recognize it and overlook it."

She also committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign if the Bill passed. However, she believed that amendments 1A to 1E, which focused on the duty to raise awareness, were unnecessary. She felt that the level of detail on the face of the Bill was not needed for amendments 1B, 1C, and 1D. The Deputy Minister believed that safeguarding was everyone's responsibility, making amendment 1C about raising concerns redundant. She requested support for amendments 1 and 4 and the rejection of amendments 1A to 1E.\n\nRegarding the post-implementation review, the Deputy Minister agreed on its importance and committed to including a duty for the review in a Government amendment. She opposed amendment 2C, which required a report on the effect of public awareness promotion before section 1 is commenced, as she believed it conflicted with the implementation priority. Amendments 2A, 2C, and 2E to 2K were also opposed by the Deputy Minister, as she saw little practical difference from what was already in the Bill. She urged members to reject non-Government amendments and support amendments 2 and 5.\n\nThe removal of the power for a Welsh Minister to make an order for commencement would also eliminate the power to make transitional provisions. Amendment 2 aimed to restore this power, while amendment 6 would bring it into force the day after Royal Assent. The Deputy Minister considered these amendments to be technical in nature. She acknowledged the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee's concerns about the procedure but stated that the absence of an Assembly procedure did not prevent scrutiny of Ministers' decisions.

        "answer": "The incorporation of a speech recognition interface in the remote control was suggested by the User Interface team, as it would allow users to select programs directly without having to press channel numbers. This technology was considered powerful and cost-effective. Marketing conducted research and found that 91% of the youngest age groups were willing to spend more money on a remote control with speech recognition. This feature was believed to enhance the market competitiveness of the product, as 80% of the 15-35 year-old group expressed a willingness to pay for trendy new products, with 75-90% of them willing to pay for speech recognition despite the higher price. Additionally, many users reported difficulties in finding their remote control, and speech recognition was seen as a solution to this problem. However, User Interface raised concerns about the ambient sound from the television potentially interfering with the speech recognition and accidentally triggering the remote control. It was suggested that the Industrial Designer ensure that the speech recognizer could filter out television speech and only recognize the user's voice. If successfully implemented, this feature was believed to make the product popular in the market. On the other hand, the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer expressed doubts about the practicality of speech recognition, as it would be affected by other sounds when the TV is on or people speak during a show. The Project Manager proposed designing a button to activate the recognition, but this was seen as no different from controlling the TV by pressing buttons."

The decision was made to have a single menu button and include voice recognition as an option. The material for the remote was agreed to be plastic with a wooden color, and a changeable case was unanimously accepted as a solution. The shape of the control was chosen to be single-curved, taking into consideration the convenience of left-handed users. The group also designed a specific case and determined the position of each button. Marketing suggested that the remote control should fit into both an original wooden cover and a standard plastic one, offering differentiated options for customers. Additionally, a simple LCD screen was proposed by User Interface to reduce costs, while Industrial Designer suggested a more complex LCD panel, such as a number pad, to display advanced functions. Marketing and the Project Manager agreed with the Industrial Designer's suggestion. The group then discussed details such as the size and functions of the buttons, as well as the inclusion of a jog-dial."

However, the success of any legislation depends on its implementation and the accompanying cultural change. The number of looked-after children in Wales is increasing due to severe neglect and abuse, and Huw David emphasized the importance of not losing focus on this issue. He acknowledged that there already existed legislation to protect children who are currently being assaulted and abused by their parents on a daily basis. However, the threshold for what constitutes abuse is unclear, and children may be led to believe that being smacked by their parents is acceptable. Huw David stressed the need to establish a clear line and viewed this as a step forward. While he was uncertain about the necessity of this legislation as a non-legislator, he believed that the Welsh Government had a vested interest in raising awareness and that it was worth considering.

The team recognized the importance of keeping good backups and discussed the time difference in obtaining more disks for recording new meetings. They decided against relying on burning CDs due to the risk of data loss. The team also considered collecting meeting notes from participants, but this would require new infrastructure. Professor D pointed out that Switchboard does not accurately record backchannels, especially with a smaller audience. Backchannels, which are the majority of overlaps in Switchboard, are less significant in online settings where backchanneling with a multi-person audience is unnatural. The team agreed that not everyone should attend meetings on specific topics and suggested alternating every two weeks for general catch-up meetings. They jokingly mentioned having a \"guys meeting\" since one group had no female members. Their main concern was collecting more data through their own meeting recordings, although many of these meetings were shorter than desired. The professor conducted a poll to gauge interest in meetings on recognition and suggested trying smaller meetings to see what happens."

This idea was in line with PhD F's comments on students in the team doing a similar thing. PhD D introduced a VTS technique for voice-unvoice, developed by Jose Carlos Segura from Grenada, which was inspired by CMU. The team discussed two new forms: a one-time speaker form and a digits form. The inclusion of time above the date in the forms was to help extract the digits during meetings. The forms also included fields for seat number, session, native language, region of origin, time spent in an English-speaking country, and accent characterization. The organization of the intermediate nodes in the belief-net was almost complete, although conditional probabilities had not been inserted yet. These nodes represented decisions that would serve as parameters for action calls in the system. The values of these nodes would be inferred from user-system interaction or requested directly from the user if necessary. It was deemed necessary for the belief-net to have at least one layer of nodes between the features and the final output to enhance flexibility in coding feature-layer probabilities."

They proposed a basic design that included volume and program icons, as well as buttons for movement, muting, recognition, and scrolling, all in a curvy shape. This design was primarily targeted towards young people. The position of common buttons such as plus, minus, sound, and program was determined by the User Interface team, with the Project Manager suggesting that the microphone, being a special feature, should be visibly placed. Ultimately, the decision was made to incorporate the microphone into the company logo. The Marketing team and Industrial Designer agreed that a scroll function would be convenient, resulting in the design of a scroll on the side of the remote. The User Interface team also suggested the inclusion of playing, recording, and stop buttons for video recorders, although they were unsure of the technological feasibility. After cost adjustments, the team decided to allocate some remaining budget to add a slogan to the front of the remote, as there was ample space and the current placement was not ideal. This change brought the overall cost of each new remote to twelve Euros fifty, still within the budget limit. To avoid interference with other devices, the User Interface team proposed creating a wave with a specific frequency and including a password within it in case two neighbors had the same remote controls. In situations where two devices were attempting to communicate with the TV set, the wave with more energy would be selected."

Additionally, a mode switch and indicator were deemed necessary for this function. The marketing team proposed designing a remote control solely for television, while the user interface designer suggested including buttons for video recorder functions, although unsure of the technological feasibility. The industrial designer agreed that a simpler remote control for television would benefit older or less coordinated individuals. The initial design of the remote control was discussed, with an emphasis on user-friendliness and clear buttons. The project manager suggested paying less attention to outdated features like teletext and focusing on customers aged forty and above, incorporating the corporate color and slogan. The remote control was intended to work exclusively with TVs, with basic functions such as volume, channel, and number buttons. The user interface proposed a button that can switch between one and two numbers. The idea of a stand-alone remote control with customizable faces and functionality for other devices was suggested. There was a disagreement between the project manager and industrial designer regarding the inclusion of kinetic function, with the manager considering it a cost reduction measure while the designer believed it would be a desirable marketing feature.
