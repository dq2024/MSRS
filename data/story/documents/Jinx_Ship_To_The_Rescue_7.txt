The orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. Cob
leaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the
Spatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded
with tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the
broad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.
  
 
  "All right," said Strike, setting down his glass. "What's on your mind,
Cob? Something's eating you."
  
 
  Whitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. "I
understand that you goofballed your chances of getting the
   
   Ganymede
   
  back when Gorman spoke his piece to you...."
  
 
  "All I said to him...."
  
 
  "I know. I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. But
you're not fooling me. You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't
want to leave her. Ver-ry commendable. Loyal! Stout fellah! But what
about Ivy?"
  
 
  "Ivy?"
  
 
  Cob looked away. "I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that
when we got back ... well...."
  
 
  Strike shook his head. "She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a
designing job."
  
 
  Cob waved an expressive arm in the air. "But dammit, man, I thought...."
  
 
  "The answer is
   
   no
   
  . Ivy's a nice girl ... but...." He paused and
sighed. "Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well...."
He shrugged. "Who wants a wife that ranks you?"
  
 
  "Never thought of that," mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;
then he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to
the pages marked "Canalopolis, Mars."
  
 
  And he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut
Strykalski III was doing the same.
