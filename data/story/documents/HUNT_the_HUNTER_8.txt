Ri swallowed. "We couldn't make the people believe that."
  
 
  "No?" Mia challenged. "Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?
You'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the
alien system!"
  
 
  "The people won't support them," Ri answered woodenly.
  
 
  "
   
   Think.
   
  If he tells them to, they will. They trust him."
  
 
  Ri looked around at the shadows.
  
 
  "That explains a lot of things," Mia said. "I think the Army's been
preparing for this for a long time. From the first, maybe. That's why
Extrone cut off our trade with the aliens. Partly to keep them from
learning that he was getting ready to invade them, but more to keep
them from exposing
   
   him
   
  to the people. The aliens wouldn't be fooled
like we were, so easy."
  
 
  "No!" Ri snapped. "It was to keep the natural economic balance."
  
 
  "You know that's not right."
  
 
  Ri lay down on his bed roll. "Don't talk about it. It's not good to
talk like this. I don't even want to listen."
  
 
  "When the invasion starts, he'll have to command
   
   all
   
  their loyalties.
To keep them from revolt again. They'd be ready to believe us, then.
He'll have a hard enough time without people running around trying to
tell the truth."
  
 
  "You're wrong. He's not like that. I know you're wrong."
  
 
  Mia smiled twistedly. "How many has he already killed? How can we even
guess?"
  
 
  Ri swallowed sickly.
  
 
  "Remember our guide? To keep our hunting territory a secret?"
  
 
  Ri shuddered. "That's different. Don't you see? This is not at all like
that."
