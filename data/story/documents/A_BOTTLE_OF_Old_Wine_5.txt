  He looked
  at the heel of his
left hand. There was a long,
irregular scar there. It was the result
of a cut he had received nearly
three weeks ago when he had
fallen over this very table and had
rammed his hand into a sliver of
broken champagne glass. Later that
evening, upon re-telporting back
home, the pain of the cut had remained
in his hand, but there was
no sign of the cut itself on the hand
of his outer self. The scar was peculiar
to the shadowy body only.
There was something about the
shadowy body that carried the
hurts to the outer body, but not the
scars....
  
 
  Sudden laughter broke out near
him, and he turned quickly in that
direction. A group of gaily costumed
revelers was standing in a
semi-circle about a small mound of
clothing upon the floor. It was the
costume of the toreador.
  
 
  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened
many times before—a costume
suddenly left empty as its
owner, due to a threat of discovery
at home, had had to press the
switch in haste to bring his shadowy
self—and complete consciousness—back
to his outer self in a
hurry.
  
 
  A waiter picked up the clothing.
He would put it safely away so that
the owner could claim it upon his
next visit to the club. Another
waiter placed a fresh bottle of
whiskey on the table before Hyrel,
and Hyrel paid him for it.
  
 
  The whiskey, reaching his head
now in surges of warm cheerfulness,
was filling him with abandonment,
courage, and a desire for
merriment. He pushed himself up
from the table, joined the merry
throng, threw his arm about the
Persian dancer, drew her close.
  
 
  They began dancing slowly to
the throbbing rhythm, dancing and
holding on to each other tightly.
Hyrel could feel her hot breath
through her veil upon his neck, adding
to the headiness of the liquor.
His feeling of depression and inferiority
flowed suddenly from him.
Once again he was the all-conquering
male.
  
 
  His arm trembled as it drew her
still closer to him and he began
dancing directly and purposefully
toward the shadows of a clump of
artificial palms near one corner of
the room. There was an exit to the
garden behind the palms.
  
 
  Half way there they passed a secluded
booth from which protruded
a long leg clad in black
mesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he
recognized that part of the costume.
It was she! The girl! The
one he had met so briefly the night
before!
  
 
  His arm slid away from the Persian
dancer, took hold of the mesh-clad
leg, and pulled. A female form
followed the leg from the booth
and fell into his arms. He held her
tightly, kissed her white neck, let
her perfume send his thoughts reeling.
  
 
  "Been looking for me, honey?"
she whispered, her voice deep and
throaty.
  
 
  "You know it!"
  
 
  He began whisking her away toward
the palms. The Persian girl
was pulled into the booth.
  
 
  Yes, she was wearing the same
costume she had worn the night
before, that of a can-can dancer of
the 90's. The mesh hose that encased
her shapely legs were held up
by flowered supporters in such a
manner as to leave four inches of
white leg exposed between hose top
and lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled
to suggest innumerable petticoats,
fell away at each hip, leaving the
front open to expose the full length
of legs. She wore a wig of platinum
hair encrusted with jewels that
sparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded
mask was as white as her
hair and covered the upper half of
her face, except for the large
almond slits for her eyes. A white
purse, jewel crusted, dangled from
one arm.
  
 
  He stopped once before reaching
the palms, drew her closer, kissed
her long and ardently. Then he began
pulling her on again.
  
 
  She drew back when they
reached the shelter of the fronds.
"Champagne, first," she whispered
huskily into his ear.
  
 
  His heart sank. He had very little
money left. Well, it might buy
a cheap brand....
