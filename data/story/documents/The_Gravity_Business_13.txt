The land of the Fweep rotated once on its axis, and Grampa lowered
the nippled bottle from his lips. He sighed. "I got it figured out,
Four," he said, holding out the pircuit proudly. "A missionary takes
over a non-rowing type cannibal, leaves him there, and then the rowing
cannibal takes over the other cannibal and leaves him there and—"
  
 
  "Not now, Grampa," Four said inattentively as he watched Fweep making
the grand tour of the cabin.
  
 
  The raspberry sphere swept over a scattering of crumbs, engulfed them,
absorbed them. Four looked at Joyce. Joyce was watching Fweep, too.
  
 
  "Rat poison?" Four asked.
  
 
  Joyce started guiltily. "How did you know?"
  
 
  "There's no use trying to poison Fweep," Four said calmly. "He's got no
enzymes to act on, no nervous system to paralyze. He doesn't even use
what he 'eats' on a molecular level at all."
  
 
  "What level does he use?" Junior wanted to know.
  
 
  "Point the scintillation counter at him."
  
 
  Junior dug one of the counters out of the supply cabinet and aimed the
pickup at Fweep. The counter began to hum. As Fweep approached, the hum
rose in pitch. As it passed, the hum dropped.
  
 
  Junior looked at the counter's dial. "He's radioactive, all right. Not
much, but enough. But where does he get the radioactive material?"
  
 
  "He uses ordinary matter," Four said. "He must have used up the few
deposits of natural radioactives a long time ago."
  
 
  "He uses ordinary substances on an atomic level?" Junior said
unbelievingly.
  
 
  Four nodded. "And that 'skin' of his—whatever it is he uses for
skin—is more efficient in stopping particle emissions than several
feet of lead."
  
 
  Fred studied Fweep thoughtfully. "Maybe we could feed him enough
enriched uranium from the pile to put him over the critical mass."
  
 
  "And blow him up? I don't think it's possible, but even if it were, it
might be a trifle more than disastrous for us." Four giggled at the
thought.
