The machine didn't answer. I waited for the electronic brain to
interfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had
said it had no way to control our actions!
  
 
  "Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?" Kane demanded. "Not if you
return with dead specimens!"
  
 
  "No," the machine admitted.
  
 
  "If you don't take us back to the Moon," Kane threatened, "I'll kill
   
   all of us
   
  !"
  
 
  The alien electronic brain was silent.
  
 
  By this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway
thing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only
tightened as I struggled.
  
 
  "If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you
failed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't
bring them proof of your failure."
  
 
  My fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as
it struggled with the problem.
  
 
  "Look at it this way," Kane persisted. "If you carry our corpses to
your masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us
to the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission
later."
  
 
  A long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.
A soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning
even their shrieks in strangling blackness.
  
 
  "You win," the machine conceded. "I'll return the ship to the Moon."
  
 
  Kane released his grip on my throat.
  
 
  "See?" he asked. "Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?"
  
 
  I didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.
