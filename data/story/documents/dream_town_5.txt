  The
  fat man rang the
bell. It was a while before an
answer came.
  
 
  It was a reedy woman in a
housecoat, her hair in curlers,
her eyes red and swollen.
  
 
  "Now, now," Dawes said
gently. "Don't you take on
like that, Mrs. Brundage. You
heard the charges. It hadda
be this way."
  
 
  "My poor Vincent," she
sobbed.
  
 
  "Better let us up," the
Sheriff said kindly. "No use
just lettin' him lay there,
Mrs. Brundage."
  
 
  "He didn't mean no harm,"
the woman snuffled. "He was
just purely ornery, Vincent
was. Just plain mean stubborn."
  
 
  "The law's the law," the
fat man sighed.
  
 
  Sol couldn't hold himself
in.
  
 
  "What law? Who's dead?
How did it happen?"
  
 
  Dawes looked at him disgustedly.
"Now is it any of
   
   your
   
  business? I mean, is it?"
  
 
  "I don't know," Sol said
miserably.
  
 
  "You better stay out of
this," the Sheriff warned.
"This is a local matter, young
man. You better stay in the
shop while we go up."
  
 
  They filed past him and the
crying Mrs. Brundage.
  
 
  When they were out of
sight, Sol pleaded with her.
  
 
  "What happened? How did
your husband die?"
  
 
  "Please ..."
  
 
  "You must tell me! Was it
something to do with Armagon?
Do you dream about the
place, too?"
  
 
  She was shocked at the
question. "Of course!"
  
 
  "And your husband? Did
he have the same dream?"
  
 
  Fresh tears resulted. "Can't
you leave me alone?" She
turned her back. "I got things
to do. You can make yourself
comfortable—" She indicated
the barber chairs, and left
through the back door.
  
 
  Sol looked after her, and
then ambled over to the first
chair and slipped into the
high seat. His reflection in
the mirror, strangely gray in
the dim light, made him
groan. His clothes were a
mess, and he needed a shave.
If only Brundage had been
alive ...
  
 
  He leaped out of the chair
as voices sounded behind the
door. Dawes was kicking it
open with his foot, his arms
laden with two rather large
feet, still encased in bedroom
slippers. Charlie was at the
other end of the burden,
which appeared to be a middle-aged
man in pajamas. The
Sheriff followed the trio up
with a sad, undertaker expression.
Behind him came Mrs.
Brundage, properly weeping.
  
 
  "We'll take him to the funeral
parlor," Dawes said,
breathing hard. "Weighs a
ton, don't he?"
  
 
  "What killed him?" Sol
said.
  
 
  "Heart attack."
  
 
  The fat man chuckled.
  
 
  The tableau was grisly. Sol
looked away, towards the
comfortingly mundane atmosphere
of the barber shop. But
even the sight of the thick-padded
chairs, the shaving
mugs on the wall, the neat
rows of cutting instruments,
seemed grotesque and morbid.
  
 
  "Listen," Sol said, as they
went through the doorway.
"About my car—"
  
 
  The Sheriff turned and regarded
him lugubriously.
"Your
   
   car
   
  ? Young man, ain't
you got no
   
   respect
   
  ?"
  
 
  Sol swallowed hard and fell
silent. He went outside with
them, the woman slamming
the barber-shop door behind
him. He waited in front of
the building while the men
toted away the corpse to some
new destination.
