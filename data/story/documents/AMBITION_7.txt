He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He
rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the
evening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell
of bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except
that she had discarded the white cloak.
  
 
  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,
carrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her
with the word, "Miss!"
  
 
  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.
  
 
  "Miss, do you speak my language?"
  
 
  "Yes," hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last
consonant.
  
 
  "Miss," he asked, watching her face intently, "what year is this?"
  
 
  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing
forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her
shoulder, "You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you."
  
 
  "Wait! You mean you don't know?"
  
 
  She shook her head. "I cannot tell you."
  
 
  "All right; we'll let it go at that."
  
 
  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.
