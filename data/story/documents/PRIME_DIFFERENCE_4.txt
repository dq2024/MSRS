I didn't like the looks of the guy any more than the looks of the
place. "I've been told you can supply me with a—"
  
 
  He coughed. "Yes, yes. I understand. It might be possible." He fingered
his mustache and regarded me from pouchy eyes. "Busy executives often
come to us to avoid the—ah—unpleasantness of formal arrangements.
Naturally, we only act as agents, you might say. We never see the
merchandise ourselves—" He wiped his hands on his trousers. "Now were
you interested in the ordinary Utility model, Mr. Faircloth?"
  
 
  I assumed he was just being polite. You didn't come to the back door
for Utility models.
  
 
  "Or perhaps you'd require one of our Deluxe models. Very careful
workmanship. Only a few key Paralyzers in operation and practically
complete circuit duplication. Very useful for—ah—close contact work,
you know. Social engagements, conferences—"
  
 
  I was shaking my head. "I want a
   
   Super
   
  Deluxe model," I told him.
  
 
  He grinned and winked. "Ah, indeed! You want perfect duplication.
Yes, indeed. Domestic situations can be—awkward, shall we say. Very
awkward—"
  
 
  I gave him a cold stare. I couldn't see where my domestic problems were
any affairs of his. He got the idea and hurried me back to a storeroom.
  
 
  "We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement. You'll go to our
laboratory on 14th Street to have the minute impressions taken. But I
can assure you you'll be delighted, simply delighted."
  
 
  The blanks weren't very impressive—clay and putty and steel, faceless,
brainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of all
sorts. He was thorough—embarrassingly thorough, in fact—but finally
he was finished. I went on to the laboratory.
  
 
  And that was all there was to it.
