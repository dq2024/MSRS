"No!" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.
  
 
  Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and
gathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and
gave his most violent command.
  
 
  At first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then
it struck him.
   
   He was standing up!
   
 
 
  The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference
between himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where
he went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,
leading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the
"clock" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.
  
 
  To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result
as before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.
  
 
  "You devil!" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,
irrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.
"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.
   
   I said you were a
god...!
   
  "
