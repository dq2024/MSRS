While the excav crew worked steadily, turning up nothing, Steffens
remained alone among the buildings. Ball came out to him, looked dryly
at the walls.
  
 
  "Well," he said, "whoever they were, we haven't heard from them since."
  
 
  "No? How can you be sure?" Steffens grunted. "A space-borne race was
roaming this part of the Galaxy while men were still pitching spears
at each other,
   
   that
   
  long ago. And this planet is only a parsec from
Varius II, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these
get to Varius? Or did they get to Earth? How can you know?"
  
 
  He kicked at the sand distractedly. "And most important, where are they
now? A race with several thousand years...."
  
 
  "Fifteen thousand," Ball said. When Steffens looked up, he added:
"That's what the geology boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the least."
  
 
  Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When he realized
now how really old they were, a sudden thought struck him.
  
 
  "But why buildings? Why did they have to build in stone, to last?
There's something wrong with that. They shouldn't have had a need
to build, unless they were castaways. And castaways would have left
   
   something
   
  behind. The only reason they would need a camp would beâ€”"
  
 
  "If the ship left and some of them stayed."
  
 
  Steffens nodded. "But then the ship must have come back. Where did it
go?" He ceased kicking at the sand and looked up into the blue-black
midday sky. "We'll never know."
  
 
  "How about the other planets?" Ball asked.
  
 
  "The report was negative. Inner too hot, outer too heavy and cold. The
third planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but
   
   it
   
  has a CO
  2
  atmosphere."
  
 
  "How about moons?"
  
 
  Steffens shrugged. "We could try them and find out."
