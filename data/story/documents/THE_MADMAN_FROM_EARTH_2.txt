"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted
them."
  
 
  "Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?"
  
 
  "Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man," Miss Meuhl said stiffly.
"He had complete confidence in me."
  
 
  "Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on," Retief said, "I won't
be so busy."
  
 
  "Well!" Miss Meuhl said. "May I ask where you'll be if something comes
up?"
  
 
  "I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives."
  
 
  Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. "Whatever for?"
  
 
  Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. "You've been here on Groac
for four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put
the present government in power?"
  
 
  "I'm sure I haven't pried into—"
  
 
  "What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this
way about ten years back?"
  
 
  "Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we
   
   avoid
   
  with the
Groaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding—"
  
 
  "Why?"
  
 
  "The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders
raking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down
the fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one
occasion."
  
 
  "You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?"
  
 
  "I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,
grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try
never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief."
  
 
  "They never found the cruiser, did they?"
  
 
  "Certainly not on Groac."
  
 
  Retief nodded. "Thanks, Miss Meuhl," he said. "I'll be back before
you close the office." Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim
disapproval as he closed the door.
