Confound the girl, he couldn't help thinking. This morning, when she
should have made herself scarce, she'd sprawled about sleeping. Now,
when he felt like seeing her, when her presence would have added a
pleasant final touch to his glowing mood, she chose to be absent. He
really should use his hypnotic control on her, he decided, and again
there sprang into his mind the word—a pet form of her name—that would
send her into obedient trance.
  
 
  No, he told himself again, that was to be reserved for some moment
of crisis or desperate danger, when he would need someone to strike
suddenly and unquestioningly for himself and mankind. Caddy was merely
a wilful and rather silly girl, incapable at present of understanding
the tremendous tensions under which he operated. When he had time for
it, he would train her up to be a fitting companion without hypnosis.
  
 
  Yet the fact of her absence had a subtly disquieting effect. It shook
his perfect self-confidence just a fraction. He asked himself if
he'd been wise in summoning the rocket physicists without consulting
Tregarron.
  
 
  But this mood, too, he conquered quickly. Tregarron wasn't his
boss, but just the Thinker's most clever salesman, an expert in the
mumbo-jumbo so necessary for social control in this chaotic era. He
himself, Jorj Helmuth, was the real leader in theoretics and all-over
strategy, the mind behind the mind behind Maizie.
  
 
  He stretched himself on the bed, almost instantly achieved maximum
relaxation, turned on the somno-learner, and began the two hour rest he
knew would be desirable before the big conference.
