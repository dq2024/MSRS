  Minos was such a lovely planet. Not a
   
  thing seemed wrong with it. Excepting the food,
   
  perhaps. And a disease that wasn't really.
  
 
 
  It was like an Earth forest in the fall, but it was not fall. The
forest leaves were green and copper and purple and fiery red, and a
wind sent patches of bright greenish sunlight dancing among the leaf
shadows.
  
 
  The hunt party of the
   
   Explorer
   
  filed along the narrow trail, guns
ready, walking carefully, listening to the distant, half familiar cries
of strange birds.
  
 
  A faint crackle of static in their earphones indicated that a gun had
been fired.
  
 
  "Got anything?" asked June Walton. The helmet intercom carried her
voice to the ears of the others without breaking the stillness of the
forest.
  
 
  "Took a shot at something," explained George Barton's cheerful voice
in her earphones. She rounded a bend of the trail and came upon Barton
standing peering up into the trees, his gun still raised. "It looked
like a duck."
  
 
  "This isn't Central Park," said Hal Barton, his brother, coming into
sight. His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the
bronze and red forest. "They won't all look like ducks," he said
soberly.
  
 
  "Maybe some will look like dragons. Don't get eaten by a dragon,
June," came Max's voice quietly into her earphones. "Not while I still
love you." He came out of the trees carrying the blood sample kit, and
touched her glove with his, the grin on his ugly beloved face barely
visible in the mingled light and shade. A patch of sunlight struck a
greenish glint from his fishbowl helmet.
