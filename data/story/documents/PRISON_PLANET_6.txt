"Whew!" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too
familiar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its
crowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.
She loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her
face tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The
Centaurian was grinning at her.
  
 
  "Do you always leave in a hurry?" she demanded, and instantly wished
she hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.
  
 
  "Long-time sleep," he announced. "Four, five hours maybe." The chest
strap was lying loose at his side.
  
 
  "That long!" she was incredulous. "I'm never out more than three
hours!" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control
panel.
  
 
  "Not taking time," he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook
her head and looked at the others.
  
 
  "That isn't doing either of them any good!"
  
 
  Rat nodded unhappily. "What's her matter—?" pointing.
  
 
  "Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing
itself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies
in a week unless it is taken out."
  
 
  "Don't know it," he said briefly.
  
 
  "Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?" she demanded.
  
 
  Rat folded his arms and considered this. "Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe
no. Where's it hurt?"
  
 
  Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further
and drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his
eyes that night ... only
   
   last
   
  night ... in the office. Peterson had
refused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.
  
 
  "No," he waved. "No appendix. Never nowhere appendix."
  
 
  "Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!" she exclaimed. "But why do
Centaurians rate it exclusively?"
  
 
  Rat ignored this and asked one of her. "What you and her doing up
there?" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.
  
 
  "You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over
in a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to
handle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because
of an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know."
  
 
  "So you?"
  
 
  "So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or
will be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for
work." She shivered.
  
 
  "Cold?" he inquired concernedly.
  
 
  "On the contrary, I'm too warm." She started to remove the blanket. Rat
threw up a hand to stop her.
  
 
  "Leave on! Hot out here."
  
 
  "But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!"
  
 
  "No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,
yes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?"
  
 
  Gray stared at him. "I never thought of it that way before. Why of
course! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from
another. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?" Heat pressing on her
face accented the fact.
  
 
  "What is your name?" she asked. "Your real one I mean."
  
 
  He grinned. "Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and
bottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does." His eyes
swept the panel and flashed back to her. "Your name Gray. Have a front
name?"
  
 
  "Patti."
  
 
  "Pretty, Patti."
  
 
  "No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?"
  
 
  "Damn punk," he said. "This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling
system groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here."
  
 
  "And ..." she followed up, "it will get warmer as we go out?"
  
 
  Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored
her. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.
  
 
  "But how about water?" she demanded next. "Is there enough?"
  
 
  He faced about. "For her—" nodding to Judith, "and him—" to Gladney,
"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe." Back to Gray. "You,
me ... twice a day. Too bad." His eyes drifted aft to the tank of
water. She followed. "One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too
bad. We get thirsty I think."
