A few weeks of this and I became a bit dazed.
  
 
  And then there was the problem of everyday existence. You might say
it's lucky to be an N/P for a while. I've heard people say that. Basic
needs provided, worlds of leisure time; on the surface it sounds
attractive.
  
 
  But let me give you an example. Say it is monthly realfood day. You go
to the store, your mouth already watering in anticipation. You take
your place in line and wait for your package. The distributor takes
your coupon book and is all ready to reach for your package—and then
he sees the fatal letters N/P. Non-Producer. A drone, a drain upon the
State. You can see his stare curdle. He scowls at the book again.
  
 
  "Not sure this is in order. Better go to the end of the line. We'll
check it later."
  
 
  You know what happens before the end of the line reaches the counter.
No more packages.
  
 
  Well, I couldn't get myself off N/P status until I got a post, and
with my name I
   
   couldn't
   
  get a post.
  
 
  Nor could I change my name. You know what happens when you try to
change something already on the records. The very idea of wanting
change implies criticism of the State. Unthinkable behavior.
  
 
  That was why this curious dream voice shocked me so. The thing that it
suggested was quite as embarrassing as its non-standard, emotional,
provocative tone.
  
 
  Bear with me; I'm getting to the voice—to
   
   her
   
  —in a moment.
  
 
  I want to tell you first about the loneliness, the terrible loneliness.
I could hardly join group games at any of the rec centers. I could join
no special interest clubs or even State Loyalty chapters. Although I
dabbled with theoretical research in my own quarters, I could scarcely
submit any findings for publication—not with my name attached. A
pseudonym would have been non-regulation and illegal.
  
 
  But there was the worst thing of all. I could not mate.
