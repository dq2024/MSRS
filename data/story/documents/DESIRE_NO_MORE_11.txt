  "ISH! HEY, Ish, wake up, will you!" There was a hand on his shoulder.
"Will you get a
   
   load
   
  of this guy!" the voice said to someone else. "An
hour to go, and he's sleeping like the dead."
  
 
  Ish willed his eyes to open. He felt his heart begin to move again, felt
the blood sluggishly beginning to surge into his veins. His hands and
feet were very cold.
  
 
  "Come on, Ish," the Crew Chief said.
  
 
  "All right," he mumbled. "Okay. I'm up." He sat on the edge of his bunk
looking down at his hands. They were blue under the fingernails. He
sighed, feeling the air moving down into his lungs.
  
 
  Stiffly, he got to his feet and began to climb into his G suit.
  
 
 
 
  The Moon opened its face to him. From where he lay, strapped into the
control seat in the forward bubble, he looked at it emotionlessly, and
began to brake for a landing.
  
 
 
 
  He looked for footprints in the crater, though he knew he hadn't left
any. Earth was a familiar sight over his right shoulder.
  
 
  He brought the twin-bubble beast back to the station. They threw
spotlights on it, for the TV pickups, and thrust microphones at him. He
could see broad grins behind the faceplates of the suits the docking
crew wore, and they were pounding his back. The interior of the Station
was a babbling of voices, a tumult of congratulations. He looked at it
all, dead-faced, his eyes empty.
  
 
  "It was easy," he said over a world-wide network, and pushed the press
representatives out of his way.
