The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his
weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig
suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden
reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling
about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down

  Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul

toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp
would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon
upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....
