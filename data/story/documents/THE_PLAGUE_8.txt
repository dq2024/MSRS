The general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into
the corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling
his granite brow.
  
 
  "But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick."
  
 
  Andy chucked. "That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk
lick a stamp? They always use a sponge."
  
 
  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and
the grin became a rumbling laugh. "How would you two like a thirty-day
furlough to rest upâ€”or to get better acquainted?"
  
 
  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.
  
 
  "And while you're gone," the general continued, "I'll see what strings
I can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,
I'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to
pin on the bars."
  
 
  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of
furlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the
depths of each other's eyes.
  
 
  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent
stamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the
stamp out of the office under guard.
  
 
  THE END
