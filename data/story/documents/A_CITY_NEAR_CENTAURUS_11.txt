Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,
then sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he
forced a short laugh. "Maota, you
   
   are
   
  complex. Why not stop all this
mystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I."
  
 
  "Of course." Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. "What do you
suppose happened to this race?"
  
 
  "You tell me."
  
 
  "They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know
how the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not
die out, as a species becomes extinct."
  
 
  Michaelson was amused, but interested. "Something like a fourth
dimension?"
  
 
  "I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.
I have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people
who conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,
who devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the
face of the instrument? Press the button, and...."
  
 
  "And what?"
  
 
  "I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the
streets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now
I will do so."
  
 
  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched
whine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it
then rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.
  
 
  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay
still. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more
carefully. No question about it.
  
 
  The old man was dead.
