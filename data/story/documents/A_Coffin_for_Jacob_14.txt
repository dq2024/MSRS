Ben stiffened. "And that's why you want me for an astrogator."
  
 
  Maggie rose, her eyes wistful. "If you want to come—and if you get
well." She looked at him strangely.
  
 
  "Suppose—" He fought to find the right words. "Suppose I got well and
decided not to join Jacob. What would happen to me? Would you let me
go?"
  
 
  Her thin face was criss-crossed by emotion—alarm, then bewilderment,
then fear. "I don't know. That would be up to Jacob."
  
 
  He lay biting his lip, staring at the photo of Jacob. She touched his
hand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion
that had coursed through her.
  
 
  "The only thing that matters, really," she murmured, "is your walking
again. We'll try this afternoon. Okay?"
  
 
  "Okay," he said.
  
 
  When she left, his eyes were still turned toward Jacob's photo.
  
 
  He was like two people, he thought.
  
 
  Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps. Perhaps one single
starry-eyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal.
  
 
  He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she
was alive. Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions:
  
 
  "A Space Officer Is Honest" "A Space Officer Is Loyal." "A Space
Officer Is Dutiful."
  
 
  Honesty, loyalty, duty. Trite words, but without those concepts,
mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it
prisoner for half a million years.
  
 
  Without them, Everson, after three failures and a hundred men dead,
would never have landed on the Moon twenty-seven years ago.
