"Wait! You forget that I also have a weapon." He pointed to the spot
behind his ear where the cylinder was buried. "I can move faster than
you can fire the gun."
  
 
  Maota nodded. "I have heard how you travel. It does not matter. I will
kill you anyway."
  
 
  "I suggest we negotiate."
  
 
  "No."
  
 
  "Why not?"
  
 
  Maota looked off toward the hills, old eyes filmed from years of sand
and wind, leather skin lined and pitted. The hills stood immobile,
brown-gray, already shimmering with heat, impotent.
  
 
  "Why not?" Michaelson repeated.
  
 
  "Why not what?" Maota dragged his eyes back.
  
 
  "Negotiate."
  
 
  "No." Maota's eyes grew hard as steel. They stood there in the sun, not
twenty feet apart, hating each other. The two moons, very pale and far
away on the western horizon, stared like two bottomless eyes.
  
 
  "All right, then. At least it's a quick death. I hear that thing just
disintegrates a man. Pfft! And that's that."
  
 
  Michaelson prepared himself to move if the old man's finger slid closer
toward the firing stud. The old man raised the gun.
  
 
  "Wait!"
  
 
  "Now what?"
  
 
  "At least read some of the book to me before I die, then."
  
 
  The gun wavered. "I am not an unreasonable man," the webfoot said.
  
 
  Michaelson stepped forward, extending his arm with the book.
  
 
  "No, stay where you are. Throw it."
  
 
  "This book is priceless. You just don't go throwing such valuable items
around."
  
 
  "It won't break. Throw it."
  
 
  Michaelson threw the book. It landed at Maota's feet, spouting sand
against his leg. He shifted the weapon, picked up the book and leafed
through it, raising his head in a listening attitude, searching for
a suitable passage. Michaelson heard the thin, metallic pages rustle
softly. He could have jumped and seized the weapon at that moment, but
his desire to hear the book was strong.
