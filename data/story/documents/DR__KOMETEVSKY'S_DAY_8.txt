   Our trick has succeeded
   
  , Dotty dreamt.
   
   The other gods have passed
our hiding place a dozen times without noticing. They search the
Universe for us many times in vain. They finally decide that we have
found a door going out of the Universe. Yet they fear us all the more.
They think of us as devils who will some day return through the door to
destroy them. So they watch everywhere. We lie quietly smiling in our
camouflaged boats, yet hardly daring to move or think, for fear that
the faintest echoes of our doings will give them a clue. Hundreds of
millions of years pass by. They seem to us no more than drugged hours
in a prison.
