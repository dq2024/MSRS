Five hundred miles above the ionosphere, the Mars rocket cut off
its fuel and slumped gratefully into an orbit that would carry it
effortlessly around the world at that altitude. The pilot unstrapped
himself and stretched, but he didn't look out the viewport at the
dried-mud disc that was Earth, cloaked in its haze of blue sky. He knew
he had two maddening months ahead of him in which to do little more
than that. Instead, he unstrapped Sappho.
  
 
  Used to free fall from two previous experiences, and loving it, the
fluffy little cat was soon bounding about the cabin in curves and
gyrations that would have made her the envy of all back-alley and
parlor felines on the planet below. A miracle cat in the dream world of
free fall. For a long time she played with a string that the man would
toss out lazily. Sometimes she caught the string on the fly, sometimes
she swam for it frantically.
  
 
  After a while the man grew bored with the game. He unlocked a drawer
and began to study the details of the wisdom he would discover on
Mars this tripâ€”priceless spiritual insights that would be balm to
war-battered mankind.
  
 
  The cat carefully selected a spot three feet off the floor, curled up
on the air, and went to sleep.
