Suddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. "Don't do that," the
nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed
the glass from the little man's slackening grasp. "You wouldn't want to
go to jail because of him."
  
 
  The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces
now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too
strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to
smash back, and now it was too late for that.
  
 
  Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. "So, it's you again?"
  
 
  The man in the gray suit smiled. "Who else in any world would stand up
for you?"
  
 
  "I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you
around, of course," Gabriel added too quickly. "You do come in useful
at times, you know."
  
 
  "So you don't mind having me around?" The nondescript man smiled again.
"Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from
yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?"
  
 
  Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. "Come on, have a drink
with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you
something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out."
  
 
  "I drank with you once too often," the nondescript man said. "And
things worked out fine, didn't they? For you." His eyes studied the
other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of
bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were
not pleased with what they saw. "Watch yourself, colleague," he warned
as he left. "Soon you might not be worth the saving."
  
 
  "Who was that, Gabe?" the girl asked.
  
 
  He shrugged. "I never saw him before in my life." Of course, knowing
him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he
happened to have been telling the truth.
