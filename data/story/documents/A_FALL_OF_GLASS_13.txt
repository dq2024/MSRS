Humphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he'd found in the library. He
held it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom
with the illustration. The cloud rose and spun, assuming the identical
shape of the illustration.
  
 
  "It's a twister," he said softly. "A Kansas twister!"
  
 
  "What," MacBride asked, his bravado slipping away again, "what ... is a
twister?"
  
 
  The twister roared and moved out of the bedroom, out over the rear of
the house toward the side of the dome. "It says here," Fownes shouted
over the roaring, "that Dorothy traveled from Kansas to Oz in a twister
and that ... and that Oz is a wonderful and mysterious land
   
   beyond the
confines of everyday living
   
  ."
  
 
  MacBride's eyes and mouth were great zeros.
  
 
  "Is there something I can turn?" Lanfierre asked.
  
 
  Huge chunks of glass began to fall around them.
  
 
  "Fownes!" MacBride shouted. "This is a direct order! Make it go back!"
  
 
  But Fownes had already begun to run on toward the next house, dodging
mountainous puffs of glass as he went. "Mrs. Deshazaway!" he shouted.
"Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Deshazaway!"
  
 
  The dome weevils were going berserk trying to keep up with the
precipitation. They whirred back and forth at frightful speed, then,
emptied of molten glass, rushed to the Trough which they quickly
emptied and then rushed about empty-handed. "Yoo-hoo!" he yelled,
running. The artificial sun vanished behind the mushrooming twister.
Optimum temperature collapsed. "Mrs. Deshazaway!
   
   Agnes
   
  , will you
marry me? Yoo-hoo!"
  
 
  Lanfierre and Lieutenant MacBride leaned against their car and waited,
dazed.
  
 
  There was quite a large fall of glass.
