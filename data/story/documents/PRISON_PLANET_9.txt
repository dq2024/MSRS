Gladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,
watching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted
to sit up.
  
 
  "Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!
   
   When're you going to start braking
   
  ,
Rat?"
  
 
  "I hear you." He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. "Lie down. You
sick."
  
 
  "I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!
We must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?"
  
 
  "Not brake," Rat answered sullenly. "No, not brake."
  
 
  "
   
   Not brake?
   
  " Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped
for him. "Are you crazy, you skinny rat?" Gray secured a hold on his
shoulders and forced him down. "You gotta brake! Don't you understand
that? You have to, you vacuum-skull!" Gray was pleading with him to
shut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. "He's gotta brake! Make
him!"
  
 
  "He has a good point there, Rat," she spoke up. "What about this
half-way line?"
  
 
  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. "We
passed line. Three days ago, maybe." A shrug of shoulders.
  
 
  "Passed!" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.
  
 
  "You catch on quick," Rat nodded. "This six day, don't you know?"
  
 
  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.
"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?"
  
 
  Rat shook his head and said nothing.
  
 
  "But Roberds said eight days, and he—"
  
 
  "—he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.
Now only six." He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.
"Six days, no brake. No."
  
 
  "I see your point, and appreciate it," Gray cut in. "But now what? This
deceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some
things I do!"
  
 
  Rat refused the expected answer. "Land tonight, I think. Never been to
Earth before. Somebody meet us, I think."
  
 
  "You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!" Gladney cried.
Gray turned to him. "The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for
   
   you
   
  !" He laughed with real satisfaction. "Oh yes, Rat, they'll be
somebody waiting for us all right." And then he added: "If we land."
  
 
  "Oh, we land." Rat confided, glad to share a secret.
  
 
  "Yeah," Gladney grated. "But in how many little pieces?"
  
 
  "I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think." Patti Gray caught
something new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed
it, too.
  
 
  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the
vacated position.
  
 
  "Earth!" she shouted.
  
 
  "Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?"
  
 
  "Just name it!"
  
 
  "Not drink long time. Some water?"
  
 
  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the
tension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last
she appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.
  
 
  "There isn't any left, Rat."
  
 
  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. "Tasted punk," he grinned at
her.
  
 
  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.
  
 
  "Rat," she said presently, "I want to ask you something, rather
personal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your
record. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was
coming, did you?"
  
 
  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. "No. Who tell Rat?"
Suddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. "Rat a.w.o.l., go
out to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send
call through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen."
  
 
  "But why didn't you explain?"
  
 
  He grinned again. "Who believe? Sick man die soon after."
  
 
  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. "You're
right, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.
You've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as
you get out of the ship."
  
 
  "They can't!" cried Patti Gray. "They can't hurt him after what he's
done now."
  
 
  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.
  
 
  "Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth
pretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat."
  
 
  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: "Say, I get it ... you're—"
  
 
  "Shut up!" Rat cut him off sharply. "You talk too much." He cast a
glance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.
