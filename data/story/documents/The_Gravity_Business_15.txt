Reba looked at Fweep kindly. "We can thank the little fellow for that,
anyway."
  
 
  "I thank him for nothing," Joyce snapped. "He lured us down here by
making us think the planet had heavy metals and I want him to let us go
   
   immediately
   
  !"
  
 
  Fred turned impatiently on his wife. "Well, try making him understand!
And if you can make him understand what you want him to do, try making
him do it!"
  
 
  Joyce looked at Fred with startled eyes. "Fred!" she said in a high,
shocked voice and turned blindly toward her room.
  
 
  Grampa lowered his bottle and smacked his lips. "Well, boy," he said to
Fred, "I thought you'd never do that. Didn't think you had it in you."
  
 
  Fred stood up apologetically. "I'd better go calm her down," he
muttered, and walked quickly after Joyce.
  
 
  "Give her one for me!" Grampa called.
  
 
  Fred's shoulders twitched as the door closed behind him. From the room
came the filtered sound of high-pitched voices rising and falling like
some reedy folk music.
  
 
  "Makes you think, doesn't it?" Grampa said, looking at Fweep benignly.
"Maybe the whole theory of gravitation is cockeyed. Maybe there's a
Fweep for every planet and sun, big and little, polarizing the gravity
in circles, and the matter business is not a cause but a result."
  
 
  "What I can't understand," Junior said thoughtfully, "is why the
polarizer worked for a little while when we landed—long enough to keep
us from being squashed—and then quit."
  
 
  "Fweep didn't recognize it immediately, didn't know what it was or
where it came from," Four explained. "All he knew was he didn't like
linear polarization and he neutralized it as soon as he could. That's
when we dropped."
