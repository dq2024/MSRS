Frieda collapsed to a chair, trembling between laughter and hysterical
weeping. Theodor looked as blank as Dotty had while waiting for words
to speak. Edmund sprang to the picture window, Celeste toward the TV
set.
  
 
  Climbing shakily out of the chair, Frieda stumbled to the picture
window and peered out beside Edmund. She saw lights bobbing along the
paths with a wild excitement.
  
 
  On the TV screen, Celeste watched two brightly lit ships spinning in
the sky—whether human spaceships or Phobos and Deimos come to help
Earth rejoice, she couldn't tell.
  
 
  Dotty spoke again, the joy in her strange voice forcing them to turn.
"And you, dear children, creatures of our camouflage, we welcome
you—whatever your future career on these planets or like ones—into
the society of enlightened worlds! You need not feel small and alone
and helpless ever again, for we shall always be with you!"
  
 
  The outer door opened. Ivan and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly smiling,
arm in arm.
  
 
  "Like rockets," Rosalind blurted happily. "We came through the
durasphere and solid rock ... shot up right to the surface."
  
 
  "They didn't have to take us along," Ivan added with a bleary grin.
"But you know that already, don't you? They're too good to let you live
in fear, so they must have told you by now."
  
 
  "Yes, we know," said Theodor. "They must be almost godlike in their
goodness. I feel ... calm."
  
 
  Edmund nodded soberly. "Calmer than I ever felt before. It's knowing, I
suppose, that—well, we're not alone."
  
 
  Dotty blinked and looked around and smiled at them all with a wholly
little-girl smile.
  
 
  "Oh, Mummy," she said, and it was impossible to tell whether she spoke
to Frieda or Rosalind or Celeste, "I've just had the funniest dream."
  
 
  "No, darling," said Rosalind gently, "it's we who had the dream. We've
just awakened."
