The caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl.
She wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face—it would be a
pretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized—was etched with
lines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. "Who is he, Dad?" the
girl said.
  
 
  "Young Cantwell. Remember?"
  
 
  So this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten
years ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.
She was a woman now....
  
 
  "Steve Cantwell?" Mary said. "Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I—I'm
sorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your
aunt. If there's anything I can do...."
  
 
  Steve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a
slim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time
like this was little short of amazing, especially since it was
completely genuine.
  
 
  He appreciated it.
  
 
  Tobias Whiting said: "Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get
along with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know
that." He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. "But I
never got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be
poor again. We could have been rich."
  
 
  Steve asked, "What happened to all your profits?"
  
 
  "Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll
never see it again."
  
 
  Mary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to
her. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding
and hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up
to recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias
Whiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of
them, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.
  
 
  But Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was
comforting and reassuring.
