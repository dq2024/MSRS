At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy
lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop
of greased hair.
  
 
  "Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine," said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung
the cell door open. "He wants to talk to you."
  
 
  "I ain't done nothin," Hull said sullenly. "There ain't nothin wrong
with burnin out a Commie, is there?"
  
 
  "Bram's a Commie, is he?" Tremaine said softly. "How'd you find that
out, Hull?"
  
 
  "He's a foreigner, ain't he?" the youth shot back. "Besides, we
heard...."
  
 
  "What did you hear?"
  
 
  "They're lookin for the spies."
  
 
  "Who's looking for spies?"
  
 
  "Cops."
  
 
  "Who says so?"
  
 
  The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to
the corner of the cell. "Cops was talkin about 'em," he said.
  
 
  "Spill it, Hull," the policeman said. "Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all
night."
  
 
  "They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called
me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get
them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around
hers."
  
 
  "And you mentioned Bram?"
  
 
  The boy darted another look at Tremaine. "They said they figured the
spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out
that way, ain't he?"
  
 
  "Anything else?"
  
 
  The boy looked at his feet.
