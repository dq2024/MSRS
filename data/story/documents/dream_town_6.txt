  He
  took a walk.
  
 
  The town was just coming
to life. People were strolling
out of their houses, commenting
on the weather, chuckling
amiably about local affairs.
Kids on bicycles were beginning
to appear, jangling the
little bells and hooting to
each other. A woman, hanging
wash in the back yard,
called out to him, thinking
he was somebody else.
  
 
  He found a little park, no
more than twenty yards in
circumference, centered
around a weatherbeaten monument
of some unrecognizable
military figure. Three
old men took their places on
the bench that circled the
General, and leaned on their
canes.
  
 
  Sol was a civil engineer.
But he made like a reporter.
  
 
  "Pardon me, sir." The old
man, leathery-faced, with a
fine yellow moustache, looked
at him dumbly. "Have you
ever heard of Armagon?"
  
 
  "You a stranger?"
  
 
  "Yes."
  
 
  "Thought so."
  
 
  Sol repeated the question.
  
 
  "Course I did. Been goin'
there ever since I was a kid.
Night-times, that is."
  
 
  "Howâ€”I mean, what kind
of place is it?"
  
 
  "Said you're a stranger?"
  
 
  "Yes."
  
 
  "Then 'tain't your business."
  
 
  That was that.
  
 
  He left the park, and wandered
into a thriving luncheonette.
He tried questioning
the man behind the counter,
who merely snickered and
said: "You stayin' with the
Dawes, ain't you? Better ask
Willie, then. He knows the
place better than anybody."
  
 
  He asked about the execution,
and the man stiffened.
  
 
  "Don't think I can talk
about that. Fella broke one of
the Laws; that's about it.
Don't see where you come
into it."
  
 
  At eleven o'clock, he returned
to the Dawes residence,
and found Mom in the
kitchen, surrounded by the
warm nostalgic odor of home-baked
bread. She told him
that her husband had left a
message for the stranger, informing
him that the State
Police would be around to get
his story.
  
 
  He waited in the house,
gloomily turning the pages of
the local newspaper, searching
for references to Armagon.
He found nothing.
  
 
  At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced
State Trooper came to
call, and Sol told his story.
He was promised nothing,
and told to stay in town until
he was contacted again by
the authorities.
  
 
  Mom fixed him a light
lunch, the greatest feature of
which was some hot biscuits
she plucked out of the oven.
It made him feel almost normal.
  
 
  He wandered around the
town some more after lunch,
trying to spark conversation
with the residents.
  
 
  He learned little.
