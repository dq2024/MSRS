   It's easy to find a solution when there is oneâ€”the trick is to do it
if there is none!
   
 
 
 
  I glanced at the path we had made across the
   
   Mare Serenitatis
   
  . The
Latin translated as "the Sea of Serenity." It was well named because,
as far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth
layer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered
across the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands
of rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.
Considering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity
like none I had ever felt.
  
 
  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because
of the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step
and every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of
dustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the
light gravity.
  
 
  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.
Indifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a
dim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak
to be reflected toward Earth.
  
 
  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams
of light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's
surface.
  
 
  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained
motionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering
voice, "Strange someone didn't notice it before."
