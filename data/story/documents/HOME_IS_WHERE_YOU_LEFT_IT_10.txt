Darkness in the Kumaji encampment.
  
 
  Far off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert.
  
 
  "Are you asleep?" Mary asked.
  
 
  "No," Steve said.
  
 
  "Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing—like a baby. As if—as if he
wasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!"
  
 
  Steve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's
voice surprised him. "I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I—"
  
 
  "I'm going to kill you," Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting.
He paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as
Steve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat
and closed there—not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again.
  
 
  Sand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.
Steve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies.
The pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against
Steve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the
thick-muscled neck, clamped there—squeezing.
  
 
  The guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed
out wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the
guard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp
seemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening
fingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard—or
death for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek
another.
