  "SIT DOWN, Ish," the Flight Surgeon said.
  
 
 
   They always begin that way
   
  , Isherwood thought. The standard medical
opening. Sit down. What for? Did somebody really believe that anything
he might hear would make him faint? He smiled with as much expression as
he ever did, and chose a comfortable chair, rolling the white cylinder
of a cigarette between his fingers. He glanced at his watch. Fourteen
hours, thirty-six minutes, and four days to go.
  
 
  "How's it?" the FS asked.
  
 
  Ish grinned and shrugged. "All right." But he didn't usually grin. The
realization disquieted him a little.
  
 
  "Think you'll make it?"
  
 
  Deliberately, rather than automatically, he fell back into his usual
response-pattern. "Don't know. That's what I'm being paid to find out."
  
 
  "Uh-
   
   huh
   
  ." The FS tapped the eraser of his pencil against his teeth.
"Look—you want to talk to a man for a while?"
  
 
  "What man?" It didn't really matter. He had a feeling that anything he
said or did now would have a bearing, somehow, on the trip. If they
wanted him to do something for them, he was bloody well going to do it.
  
 
  "Fellow named MacKenzie. Big gun in the head-thumping racket." The
Flight Surgeon was trying to be as casual as he could. "Air Force
insisted on it, as a matter of fact," he said. "Can't really blame them.
After all, it's
   
   their
   
  beast."
  
 
  "Don't want any hole-heads denting it up on them, huh?" Ish lit the
cigarette and flipped his lighter shut with a snap of the lid. "Sure.
Bring him on."
  
 
  The FS smiled. "Good. He's—uh—he's in the next room. Okay to ask him
in right now?"
  
 
  "Sure." Something flickered in Isherwood's eyes. Amusement at the Flight
Surgeon's discomfort was part of it. Worry was some of the rest.
