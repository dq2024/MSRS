Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had
ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid
desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was
going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that
shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly
he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't
dared touch the machine since.
  
 
  For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never
been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised
his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on
a trailer tour of the
   
   West
   
  that very summer. Since that promise, he
could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and
be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out
of his subconscious. Yet he
   
   had
   
  to write at least three novelets and
a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great
adventureâ€”or the trip was off.
  
 
  So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed
for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a
salable yarn....
  
 
  "Hey!" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the
road. "What's the trouble?"
  
 
  Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the
stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech
and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand
clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of
his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.
