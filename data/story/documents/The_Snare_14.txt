I assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of
what he was driving at and I told him so.
  
 
  "Ed," he said, "if you could build an electronic brain capable of
making decisions, how would you build it?"
  
 
  "Hell, I don't know," I confessed.
  
 
  "Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this
ship, I'd build it with a
   
   conscience
   
  so it'd do its best at all
times."
  
 
  "Machines always do their best," I argued. "Come on, untie us. I'm
getting a crick in my back!" I didn't like the idea of being slugged
while asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been
present, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.
  
 
  "
   
   Our
   
  machines always do their best," he argued, "because we punch
buttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic
brain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it
even has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!"
  
 
  "So what?"
  
 
  He shrugged muscular shoulders. "So this ship is operated by a
thinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered
such a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last
night figuring—"
  
 
  "What are you talking about?" I interrupted. "Are you so drunk that you
don't know—"
  
 
  "I'll show you, Ed."
  
 
  He walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick
fingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.
  
 
  "Can you see me, machine?" he asked the empty air.
  
 
  "Yes," the electronic brain replied.
  
 
  "Watch!"
  
 
  Kane tightened his fingers around my throat.
  
 
  Verana and Marie screamed shrilly.
  
 
  My head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.
  
 
  "Please stop," the machine pleaded.
  
 
  "What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return
to them with a cargo of dead people!"
