The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and
about forty and he hated spacemen.
  
 
  His body was buried nowâ€”probably in the silent gray wastes outside
Luna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a
part of Ben as sight in his eyes.
  
 
  Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips
spitting whiskey-slurred curses.
  
 
  Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist
thudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the
whiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle
from a corner of the gaping mouth.
  
 
  You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or
ignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a
memory that has burned into your mind.
  
 
  It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had
been successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.
He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb
plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.
  
 
  "Spacemen," he muttered, "are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you
see's spacemen."
  
 
  He was a neatly dressed civilian.
  
 
  Ben smiled. "If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here."
  
 
  "The name's Cobb." The man hiccoughed. "Spacemen in their white monkey
suits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a
little tin god." He downed a shot of whiskey.
  
 
  Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,
crimson-braided uniform of the
   
   Odyssey's
   
  junior astrogation officer.
He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining
uniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.
  
 
  He'd sought long for that key.
