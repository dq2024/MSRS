Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. "I'd say we've
done everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a
thorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,
is in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions
are being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the
eveningâ€”which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance."
  
 
  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.
Celeste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that
had engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.
  
 
  "I'll take over Ivan's notes," she heard Edmund say. "They're mainly
about the Deep Shaft."
  
 
  "How far have they got with that?" Frieda asked idly. "Twenty-five
miles?"
  
 
  "Nearer thirty, I believe," Edmund answered, "and still going down."
  
 
  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes
went toward Ivan's briefcase.
