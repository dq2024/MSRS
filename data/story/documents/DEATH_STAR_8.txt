He turned back to the window. "And all because a pirate named Devil
Garrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!"
  
 
  "You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that

soon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,
how long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you
described?"
  
 
  "Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?"
  
 
  "Not half quick enough," she murmured happily, "but it'll have to do,
Star." Laughing, she turned her face up to his. "Have you ever thought
that planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?"
