She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her
and looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced
by the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in
sight.
  
 
  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier
had ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left
the city, were not built to do so. But
   
   he
   
  was here; with luck, he
could capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.
  
 
  "Go on!" he ordered hoarsely. "Move!"
  
 
  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened
wire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.
  
 
  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.
Never had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar
non-mechanical construction.
  
 
  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling
as that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling
body of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.
  
 
  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog
thinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last
hundred feet to sanctuary.
  
 
  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within
the tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and
slept for several hours.
