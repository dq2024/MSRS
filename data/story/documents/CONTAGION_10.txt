"Go ahead and eat it. It just wouldn't digest. You'd stay hungry."
  
 
  "Why?" Len was aggrieved.
  
 
  "Chemical differences in the basic protoplasm of Minos. Different
amino linkages, left-handed instead of right-handed molecules in the
carbohydrates, things like that. Nothing will be digestible here until
you are adapted chemically by a little test-tube evolution. Till then
you'd starve to death on a full stomach."
  
 
  Pat's side of the table had been loaded with the dishes from two trays,
but it was almost clear now and the dishes were stacked neatly to one
side. He started on three desserts, thoughtfully tasting each in turn.
  
 
  "Test-tube evolution?" Max repeated. "What's that? I thought you people
had no doctors."
  
 
  "It's a story." Pat leaned back again. "Alexander P. Mead, the head of
the Mead clan, was a plant geneticist, a very determined personality
and no man to argue with. He didn't want us to go through the struggle
of killing off all Minos plants and putting in our own, spoiling the
face of the planet and upsetting the balance of its ecology. He decided
that he would adapt our genes to this planet or kill us trying. He did
it all right.'"
  
 
  "Did which?" asked June, suddenly feeling a sourceless prickle of fear.
  
 
  "Adapted us to Minos. He took human cellsâ€”"
