   This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could
he—and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?
   
 
 
 
  The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the
old, orange sun.
  
 
  It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The
flivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat
cylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been
slapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,
fully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.
  
 
  As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,
at the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.
  
 
  A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass
and knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that
made the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver
rocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.
  
 
  Then all was quiet—outside.
  
 
  Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the
air. "Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing
practically whipped, too!"
