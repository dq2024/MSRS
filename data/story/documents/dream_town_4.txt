  They
  crossed the
street diagonally, and entered
a two-story wooden building.
Dawes took the stairs at a
brisk pace, and pushed open
the door on the second floor.
A fat man looked up from
behind a desk.
  
 
  "Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd
see if you wanted to help
move Brundage."
  
 
  The man batted his eyes.
"Oh, Brundage!" he said.
"You know, I clean forgot
about him?" He laughed.
"Imagine me forgetting
that?"
  
 
  "Yeah." Dawes wasn't
amused. "And you Prince Regent."
  
 
  "Aw, Willie—"
  
 
  "Well, come on. Stir that
fat carcass. Gotta pick up
Sheriff Coogan, too. This
here gentleman has to see him
about somethin' else."
  
 
  The man regarded Sol suspiciously.
"Never seen you
before. Night
   
   or
   
  day. Stranger?"
  
 
  "Come
   
   on
   
  !" Dawes said.
  
 
  The fat man grunted and
hoisted himself out of the
swivel chair. He followed
lamely behind the two men
as they went out into the
street again.
  
 
  A woman, with an empty
market basket, nodded casually
to them. "Mornin', folks.
Enjoyed it last night.
Thought you made a right
nice speech, Mr. Dawes."
  
 
  "Thanks," Dawes answered
gruffly, but obviously flattered.
"We were just goin'
over to Brundage's to pick up
the body. Ma's gonna pay a
call on Mrs. Brundage around
ten o'clock. You care to visit?"
  
 
  "Why, I think that's very
nice," the woman said. "I'll
be sure and do that." She
smiled at the fat man. "Mornin',
Prince."
  
 
  Sol's head was spinning. As
they left the woman and continued
their determined
march down the quiet street,
he tried to find answers.
  
 
  "Look, Mr. Dawes." He was
panting; the pace was fast.
"Does
   
   she
   
  dream about this—Armagon,
too? That woman
back there?"
  
 
  "Yep."
  
 
  Charlie chuckled. "He's a
stranger, all right."
  
 
  "And you, Mr.—" Sol
turned to the fat man. "You
also know about this palace
and everything?"
  
 
  "I told you," Dawes said
testily. "Charlie here's Prince
Regent. But don't let the fancy
title fool you. He got no
more power than any Knight
of the Realm. He's just too
dern fat to do much more'n
sit on a throne and eat grapes.
That right, Charlie?"
  
 
  The fat man giggled.
  
 
  "Here's the Sheriff," Dawes
said.
  
 
  The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed
citizen with a long, sad face,
was rocking on a porch as
they approached his house,
trying to puff a half-lit pipe.
He lifted one hand wearily
when he saw them.
  
 
  "Hi, Cookie," Dawes
grinned. "Thought you, me,
and Charlie would get Brundage's
body outa the house.
This here's Mr. Becker; he
got another problem. Mr.
Becker, meet Cookie Coogan."
  
 
  The Sheriff joined the procession,
pausing only once to
inquire into Sol's predicament.
  
 
  He described the hitchhiker
incident, but Coogan
listened stoically. He murmured
something about the
Troopers, and shuffled alongside
the puffing fat man.
  
 
  Sol soon realized that their
destination was a barber shop.
  
 
  Dawes cupped his hands
over the plate glass and
peered inside. Gold letters on
the glass advertised: HAIRCUT
SHAVE & MASSAGE
PARLOR. He reported: "Nobody
in the shop. Must be
upstairs."
