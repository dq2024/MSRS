It took the better part of an hour to rig up the electric mixer.
  
 
  Capt. Wilkins was profusely congratulated.
  
 
  "Now," Major Winship said, "we can either bring the drum inside or take
the mixer out there."
  
 
  "We're going to have to bring the drum in," Capt. Wilkins said.
  
 
  "Well," said Capt. Lawler, "that will make it nice and cozy."
  
 
  It took the four of them to roll the drum inside, rocking it back and
forth through the airlock. At that time, it was apparent the table was
interposing itself.
  
 
  Lt. Chandler tried to dismantle the table. "Damn these suits," he said.
  
 
  "You've got it stuck between the bunk post."
  
 
  "I
   
   know
   
  that."
  
 
  "I don't think this is the way to do it," Major Winship said. "Let's
back the drum out."
  
 
  Reluctantly, they backed the drum out and deposited it. With the aid of
Capt. Lawler, Lt. Chandler got the table unstuck. They passed it over
to Major Winship, who handed it out to Capt. Wilkins. Captain Wilkins
carried it around the drum of calking compound and set it down. It
rested uneasily on the uneven surface.
  
 
  "Now, let's go," said Major Winship.
  
 
  Eventually, they accomplished the moving. They wedged the drum between
the main air-supply tank and the transmitter. They were all perspiring.
"It's not the weight, it's the mass," said Capt. Wilkins brightly.
  
 
  "The hell it isn't the weight," said Lt. Chandler. "That's heavy."
  
 
  "With my reefer out," said Major Winship, "I'm the one it's rough on."
He shook perspiration out of his eyes. "They should figure a way to get
a mop in here, or a towel, or a sponge, or something. I'll bet you've
forgotten how much sweat stings in the eyes."
  
 
  "It's the salt."
  
 
  "Speaking of salt. I wish I had some salt tablets," Major Winship said.
"I've never sweat so much since basic."
  
 
  "Want to bet Finogenov hasn't got a bushel of them?"
  
 
  "No!" Major Winship snapped.
