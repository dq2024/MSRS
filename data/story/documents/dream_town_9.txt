  He
  was flanked by marble
pillars, thrusting towards
a high-domed ceiling.
  
 
  The room stretched long
and wide before him, the
walls bedecked in stunning
purple draperies.
  
 
  He whirled at the sound of
footsteps, echoing stridently
on the stone floor. Someone
was running towards him.
  
 
  It was Sally, pigtails
streaming out behind her, the
small body wearing a flowing
white toga. She was shrieking,
laughing as she skittered
past him, clutching a gleaming
gold helmet.
  
 
  He called out to her, but
she was too busy outdistancing
her pursuer. It was Sheriff
Coogan, puffing and huffing,
the metal-and-gold cloth
uniform ludicrous on his
lanky frame.
  
 
  "Consarn kid!" he wheezed.
"Gimme my hat!"
  
 
  Mom was following him,
her stout body regal in scarlet
robes. "Sally! You give
Sir Coogan his helmet! You
hear?"
  
 
  "Mrs. Dawes!" Sol said.
  
 
  "Why, Mr. Becker! How
nice to see you again! Pa!
   
   Pa!
   
  Look who's here!"
  
 
  Willie Dawes appeared.
   
   No!
   
  Sol thought. This was
   
   King
   
  Dawes; nothing else
could explain the magnificence
of his attire.
  
 
  "Yes," Dawes said craftily.
"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,
Mr. Becker."
  
 
  "Armagon?" Sol gaped.
"Then this is the place
you've been dreaming about?"
  
 
  "Yep," the King said. "And
now
   
   you're
   
  in it, too."
  
 
  "Then I'm only dreaming!"
  
 
  Charlie, the fat man,
clumsy as ever in his robes of
State, said: "So
   
   that's
   
  the
snooper, eh?"
  
 
  "Yep," Dawes chuckled.
"Think you better round up
the Knights."
  
 
  Sol said: "The Knights?"
  
 
  "Exelution! Exelution!"
Sally shrieked.
  
 
  "Now wait a minute—"
  
 
  Charlie shouted.
  
 
  Running feet, clanking of
armor. Sol backed up against
a pillar. "Now look here.
You've gone far enough—"
  
 
  "Not quite," said the King.
  
 
  The Knights stepped forward.
  
 
  "Wait!" Sol screamed.
  
 
  Familiar faces, under shining
helmets, moved towards
him; the tips of sharp-pointed
spears gleaming wickedly.
And Sol Becker wondered—would
he ever awake?
