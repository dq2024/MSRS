The farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and
there was a noise of crackling underbrush.
  
 
  "He's good bait," Extrone said. "He's fat enough and he knows how to
scream good."
  
 
  Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully
eying the forest across from the watering hole.
  
 
  Extrone began to tremble with excitement. "Here they come!"
  
 
  The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his
lap.
  
 
  The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank,
swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed.
Its mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs
behind them, rattling leaves.
  
 
 
 
  "Shoot!" Lin hissed. "For God's sake, shoot!"
  
 
  "Wait," Extrone said. "Let's see what they do." He had not moved
the rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath
beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.
  
 
  The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.
  
 
  "Look!" Extrone cried excitedly. "Here it comes!"
  
 
  Ri began to scream again.
  
 
  Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin
waited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.
  
 
  The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing
a sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.
  
 
  "Watch! Watch!" Extrone cried gleefully.
  
 
  And then the aliens sprang their trap.
