  She had gone
  coldly rigid in
his arms, unyielding.
  
 
  Madness added to the pounding
in his brain. Tears welled into his
eyes.
  
 
  "I'll show you! I'll kill her! Then
I'll have money!" The hands
clutching her shoulders shook her
drunkenly. "You wait here! I'll go
home and kill her now! Then I'll
be back!"
  
 
  "Silly boy!" Her low laughter
rang hollowly in his ears. "And just
who is it you are going to kill?"
  
 
  "My wife!" he cried. "My wife!
I'll ..."
  
 
  A sudden sobering thought
struck him. He was talking too
much. And he wasn't making sense.
He shouldn't be telling her this.
Anyway, he couldn't get the money
tonight even if he did kill his wife.
  
 
  "And so you are going to kill
your wife...."
  
 
  He blinked the tears from his
eyes. His chest was heaving, his
heart pounding. He looked at her
shimmering form. "Y-yes," he whispered.
  
 
  Her eyes glinted strangely in the
light of the moon. Her handbag
glinted as she opened it, and something
she took from it glittered
coldly in her hand.
  
 
  "Fool!"
  
 
  The first shot tore squarely
through his heart. And while he
stood staring at her, mouth agape,
a second shot burned its way
through his bewildered brain.
