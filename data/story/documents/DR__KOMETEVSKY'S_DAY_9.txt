Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. "We
need a break."
  
 
  Frieda agreed wearily. "We've gone through everything."
  
 
  "Good idea," Edmund said briskly. "I think we've hit on several crucial
points along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of

and present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?"
  
 
  Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his
cloak over a shoulder.

room where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped.

A lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world.
   
 
 
  But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.
