  "It is rather unusual," Magnan said, "to assign an officer of your rank
to courier duty, but this is an unusual mission."
  
 
  Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grew
awkward, Magnan went on.
  
 
  "There are four planets in the group," he said. "Two double planets,
all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They're
called Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance
whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti
have been penetrating.
  
 
  "Now—" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—"we have learned
that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met no
opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they
intend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force."
  
 
  Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drew
carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.
  
 
  "This is open aggression, Retief," he said, "in case I haven't made
myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien
species. Obviously, we can't allow it."
  
 
  Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.
  
 
  "A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,
Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They're
farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in
their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war
potential, by conventional standards, is nil."
  
 
  Magnan tapped the folder before him.
  
 
  "I have here," he said solemnly, "information which will change that
picture completely." He leaned back and blinked at Retief.
