Four shrugged his narrow shoulders and wandered to the view screen.
Within it was the green horizon, curving noticeably. Four angled the
picture in toward the ship, sweeping through green, peaceful woodland
and plain and blue lake until he stared down into the meadow at the
flivver's stern.
  
 
  "Look!" he said suddenly. "This planet not only has flora—it has
fauna." He rushed to the air lock.
  
 
  "Four!" Reba called out warningly.
  
 
  "It's all right, Reba," Four assured her. "The air is within one per
cent of Earth-normal and the bio-analyzer can find no micro-organisms
viable within the Terran spectrum."
  
 
  "What about macro-organisms—" Reba began, but the boy was gone
already. Reba's face was troubled. "That boy!" she said to Junior.
"Sometimes I think we've made a terrible mistake with him. He should
have friends, play-mates. He's more like a little old man than a boy."
  
 
  But Junior nodded meaningfully at Fred and disappeared into the chart
room. Fred followed casually. Then, as the door slid shut behind him,
he asked impatiently. "Well, what's all the mystery?"
  
 
  "No use bothering the others yet," Junior said, his face puzzled. "You
see, I didn't let the flivver drop those last few inches. The polarizer
quit."
  
 
  "Quit!"
  
 
  "That's not the worst. I tried to take it up again. The flivver—it
won't budge!"
