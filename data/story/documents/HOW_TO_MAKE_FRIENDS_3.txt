"Nonsense," Manet said. "No group of private individuals can build a
spaceship. It takes a combine of nations."
  
 
  "But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known.
Ask anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the
capitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper.
They play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things
they can forego the papers. Comprehend,
   
   mon ami
   
  ? My businessmen
have gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw
materials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they
make it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals."
  
 
  "I don't believe you," Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown
blunt with disuse. "What possible profit could your principals turn
from running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the
planets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't
already supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for
it? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this
glass of whiskey."
  
 
  "Do you find it good whiskey?"
  
 
  "Very good."
  
 
  "Excellent?"
  
 
  "Excellent, if you prefer."
  
 
  "I only meant—but never mind. We give you what you want. As for
paying for it—why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a
Trader Tom Credit Card."
  
 
  "And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?" Manet demanded.
"That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it."
  
 
  "That's it precisely!" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. "You
   
   never
   
  pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your
   
   estate
   
  ."
  
 
  "But I may leave no estate!"
  
 
  Trader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. "All businesses operate on
a certain margin of risk. That is our worry."
