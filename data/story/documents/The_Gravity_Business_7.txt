"You mean Fweep?" Four asked in astonishment.
  
 
  "I mean that thing, whatever you call it." Joyce fluttered her hand
impatiently. "Get it out!"
  
 
  Four's eyes widened farther. "But Fweep's my friend."
  
 
  "Nonsense!" Joyce said sharply. "Earthmen don't make friends with
aliens. And that's nothing but a—a blob!"
  
 
  "Fweep?" queried the raspberry lips. "Fweep?"
  
 
  "If it's Four's friend," Reba said firmly, "it can stay. If you don't
like to be around it, Grammy, you can always go to your own room."
  
 
  Joyce stood up indignantly. "Well! And don't call me 'Grammy!' It makes
me sound as old as that old goat over there!" She glared malignantly
at Grampa. "If you'd rather have that blob than me—well!" She swept
grandly out of the central cabin and into one of the private rooms that
opened out from it.
  
 
  "Fweep?" asked the blob.
  
 
  "Sure," Four said. "Go ahead, fweep—I mean sweep."
  
 
  Swiftly the sphere rolled across the floor. Behind it was left a
narrow path of sparkling clean tile.
  
 
  Grampa glanced warily at Joyce's door to make sure it was completely
closed and then cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. "Good for you, Reba!"
he said admiringly. "For forty years now, I've wanted to do that. Never
had the nerve."
  
 
  "Why, thanks, Grampa," Reba said, surprised.
  
 
  "I like you, gal. Never forget it."
  
 
  "I like you, too, Grampa. If you'd been a few years younger, Junior
would have had competition!"
  
 
  "You bet he would!" Grampa leaned back and cackled. Then he leaned
over confidentially toward Reba and whispered, "Beats me why you ever
married a jerk like Junior, anyhow."
  
 
  Reba looked thoughtfully toward the airlock door. "Maybe I saw
something in him nobody else saw, the man he might become. He's been
submerged in this family too long; he's still a child to all of you
and to himself, too." Reba smiled at Grampa brilliantly. "And maybe I
thought he might grow into a man like his grandfather."
