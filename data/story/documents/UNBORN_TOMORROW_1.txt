  UNBORN
   
  TOMORROW

 Unfortunately
 , there was only
one thing he could bring back
from the wonderful future ...
and though he didn't want to
... nevertheless he did....

  Betty
  looked up from
her magazine. She said
mildly, "You're late."
  
 
  "Don't yell at me, I
feel awful," Simon told
her. He sat down at his desk, passed
his tongue over his teeth in distaste,
groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the
aspirin bottle.
  
 
  He looked over at Betty and said,
almost as though reciting, "What I
need is a vacation."
  
 
  "What," Betty said, "are you going
to use for money?"
  
 
  "Providence," Simon told her
whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,
"will provide."
  
 
  "Hm-m-m. But before providing
vacations it'd be nice if Providence
turned up a missing jewel deal, say.
Something where you could deduce
that actually the ruby ring had gone
down the drain and was caught in the
elbow. Something that would net
about fifty dollars."
  
 
  Simon said, mournful of tone,
"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five
hundred?"
  
 
  "I'm not selfish," Betty said. "All
I want is enough to pay me this
week's salary."
  
 
  "Money," Simon said. "When you
took this job you said it was the romance
that appealed to you."
  
 
  "Hm-m-m. I didn't know most
sleuthing amounted to snooping
around department stores to check on
the clerks knocking down."
  
 
  Simon said, enigmatically, "Now
it comes."
