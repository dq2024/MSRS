Jorj Helmuth snipped the emerging answer tape into sections and handed
each to the appropriate man. Most of them carefully tucked theirs away
with little more than a glance, but the Secretary of Space puzzled over
his.
  
 
  "Who the devil would Maelzel be?" he asked.
  
 
  A remote look came into the eyes of the Secretary of State. "Edgar
Allen Poe," he said frowningly, with eyes half-closed.
  
 
  The grizzled general snapped his fingers. "Sure! Maelzel's Chess
player. Read it when I was a kid. About an automaton that was supposed
to play chess. Poe proved it hid a man inside it."
  
 
  The Secretary of Space frowned. "Now what's the point in a fool
question like that?"
  
 
  "You said it came from Opperly's group?" Jorj asked sharply.
  
 
  The Secretary of Space nodded. The others looked at the two men
puzzledly.
  
 
  "Who would that be?" Jorj pressed. "The group, I mean."
  
 
  The Secretary of Space shrugged. "Oh, the usual little bunch over at
the Institute. Hindeman, Gregory, Opperly himself. Oh, yes, and young
Farquar."
  
 
  "Sounds like Opperly's getting senile," Jorj commented coldly. "I'd
investigate."
  
 
  The Secretary of Space nodded. He suddenly looked tough. "I will. Right
away."
