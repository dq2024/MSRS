Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his
own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough
for him. He would report when the time was ripe.
  
 
  "Doubtless," said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference
was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his
elders, "the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building
that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means
of transport."
  
 
  Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret
conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it.
The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.
  
 
  "When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime,
remember your position in the family."
  
 
  Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.
  
 
  "Listen to the boy," said the aged father. "There is more wisdom in his
head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of
the clay."
  
 
  Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him
a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough
thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in
their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they
did.
  
 
  Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought
about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way
of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could
figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of
his brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of
course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.
