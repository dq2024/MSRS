Light showered the room in a dazzling explosion. Ben, half blinded,
realized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been
turned on.
  
 
  The light washed away the room's strangeness and its air of brooding
wickedness, revealing drab concrete walls and a debris-strewn floor.
  
 
  Eyes blinked and squinted. There were swift, frightened movements and
a chorus of angry murmurs. The patrons of the Blast Inn were like
tatter-clad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away.
  
 
  Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect. His chair tumbled backward,
falling.
  
 
  The white-clad men charged, neuro-clubs upraised.
  
 
  A woman screamed. The music ceased. The Martian orchestra slunk with
feline stealth to a rear exit. Only the giant Venusians remained
undisturbed. They stood unmoving, their staring eyes shifting lazily in
Ben's direction.
  
 
  "Curtis!" one of the policemen yelled. "You're covered! Hold it!"
  
 
  Ben whirled away from the advancing police, made for the exit into
which the musicians had disappeared.
  
 
  A hissing sound traveled past his left ear, a sound like compressed air
escaping from a container. A dime-sized section of the concrete wall
ahead of him crumbled.
  
 
  He stumbled forward. They were using deadly neuro-pistols now, not the
mildly stunning neuro-clubs.
  
 
  Another hiss passed his cheek. He was about twelve feet from the exit.
   
   Another second
   
  , his brain screamed.
   
   Just another secondâ€”
   
 
 
  Or would the exits be guarded?
  
 
  He heard the hiss.
  
 
  It hit directly in the small of his back. There was no pain, just a
slight pricking sensation, like the shallow jab of a needle.
