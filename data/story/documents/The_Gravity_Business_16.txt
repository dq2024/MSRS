"Linear polarization is uncomfortable for him, is it?" Grampa said.
"Makes you wonder how something like Fweep could ever develop."
  
 
  "He's no more improbable than people," said Four.
  
 
  "Less than some I've known," Grampa conceded.
  
 
  "If he can eat anything," Reba said, "why does he keep sweeping the
cabin for dust and lint?"
  
 
  "He wants to be helpful," Four replied without hesitation, "and he's
lonely. After all," he added wistfully, "he's never had any friends."
  
 
  "How do you know all these things?" Joyce asked from her doorway,
excitement in her voice. "Can you talk to it?"
  
 
  Behind her, Fred said, "Now, Joyce, you promised—"
  
 
  "But this is important," Joyce cut him off eagerly. "Can you? Talk to
it, I mean?"
  
 
  "Some," Four admitted.
  
 
  "Have you asked it to let us go?"
  
 
  "Yes."
  
 
  "Well? What did it say?"
  
 
  "He said he didn't want his friend to leave him."
  
 
  At the word, Fweep rolled swiftly across the floor and bounced into
Four's lap. It nestled against him lovingly and opened raspberry lips.
"Fwiend," it said.
  
 
  "Well, now," Grampa said maliciously, his eye on Joyce, "that's no
problem. We can just leave Four here with Fweep."
  
 
  In a voice filled with sanctimonious concern, Joyce said, "That's quite
a sacrifice to ask, but—"
  
 
  "Joyce!" Reba cried, horrified. "Grampa was joking, but you actually
mean it. Four is only a baby and yet you'd let him—"
  
 
  "Never mind, Reba," Four said evenly. "It was just what I was going to
suggest myself. It's the one really logical solution."
  
 
  "Fwiend," said Fweep gently.
