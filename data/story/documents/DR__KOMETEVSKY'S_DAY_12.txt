At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he
saw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the
blue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the
tiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could
hardly have been fifteen.
  
 
  The TV was saying, "... in addition, a number of mysterious
disappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These
are thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,
and impulse traveling—a result of the unusual stresses of the time.

  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining
casually, "Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over
for him." When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,
"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen," and squeezed herself a glass of
pomegranate juice.
  
 
  The monkeylike figure muttered, "Scotch-and-soda," then turned toward
Edmund and asked, "And what is your reaction to all this, sir?"
