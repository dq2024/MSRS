Feet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her
hands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered "Hold tight!" in her
ear and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away
in a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on
some projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher. Wind
returned to her throat, and she breathed again.
  
 
  "I'm sorry," she managed to get out, gaspingly. "I wasn't expecting
that. I had forgotten you—"
  
 
  "—had wings," he finished and chuckled. "So likewise Greaseball." The
pale office lights dropped away as they sped over the field. On the far
horizon, a tinge of dawn crept along the uneven terrain.
  
 
  "Oh, the bag!" she gasped. "I've dropped it."
  
 
  He chuckled again. "Have got. You scare, I catch."
  
 
  She didn't see the ship because of the wind in her eyes, but without
warning she plummeted down and her feet jarred on the lip of the lock.
"Inside. No noise, no light. Easy." But in spite of his warning she
tripped in the darkness. He helped her from the floor and guided her to
the hammocks.
  
 
  "Judith?" she asked.
  
 
  "Here. Beside you, trussed up so tight I can hardly breathe."
  
 
  "No talk!" Rat insisted. "Much hush-hush needed. Other girl shipshape.
You make likewise." Forcibly he shoved her into a hammock. "Wrap up
tight. Straps tight. When we go, we go fast. Bang!" And he left her.
  
 
  "Hey! Where are you going now?"
  
 
  "To get Gladney. He sick too. Hush hush!" His voice floated back.
  
 
  "Where has he gone?" Judith called.
  
 
  "Back for another man. Remember the two miners who found us when we
crashed? The burly one fell off a rock-bank as they were bringing us
in. Stove in his ribs pretty badly. The other has a broken arm ...
happened once while you were out. They wouldn't let me say anything for
fear of worrying you."
