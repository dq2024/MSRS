He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose. His body seemed to be
growing, swelling into balloon proportions. He knew that the tiny
needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh, knew that the paralyzing
mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of
his body.
  
 
  He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion. He'd have
fifteen—maybe twenty—seconds before complete lethargy of mind and
body overpowered him.
  
 
  In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness, he heard a voice
yell, "Turn on the damn lights!"
  
 
  Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand. He realized that
someone had seized it.
  
 
  A soft feminine voice spoke to him. "You're wounded? They hit you?"
  
 
  "Yes." His thick lips wouldn't let go of the word.
  
 
  "You want to escape—even now?"
  
 
  "Yes."
  
 
  "You may die if you don't give yourself up."
  
 
  "No, no."
  
 
  He tried to stumble toward the exit.
  
 
  "All right then. Not that way. Here, this way."
  
 
  Heavy footsteps thudded toward them. A few yards away, a flashlight
flicked on.
  
 
  Hands were guiding him. He was aware of being pushed and pulled. A
door closed behind him. The glare of the flashlight faded from his
vision—if he still had vision.
  
 
  "You're sure?" the voice persisted.
  
 
  "I'm sure," Ben managed to say.
  
 
  "I have no antidote. You may die."
  
 
  His mind fought to comprehend. With the anti-paralysis injection,
massage and rest, a man could recover from the effects of mortocain
within half a day. Without treatment, the paralysis could spread to
heart and lungs. It could become a paralysis of death. An effective
weapon: the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender
at once.
  
 
  "Anti ... anti ..." The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced
from his throat. "No ... I'm sure ... sure."
  
 
  He didn't hear the answer or anything else.
