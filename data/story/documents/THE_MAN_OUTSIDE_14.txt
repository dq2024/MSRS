giving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was
he trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right
thing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all
right.
  
 
  Was Conrad
   
   actually
   
  different from the rest?
  
 
  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had
consisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...
nothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they
had stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?

have fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal."

blame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other

him.

many legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.
