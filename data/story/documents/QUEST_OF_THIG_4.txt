  For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had

  "Sorry I was late," he said, digging into his pocket for the
glittering baubles, "but I was poking around on the beach where we used
to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing

trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right

  "Uh huh," agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages
and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he
hoped that the west had reformed.
  
 
  "I saved some kraut and weiners," Ellen said. "Get washed up while I'm
warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from
the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?"
  
 
  "Mmmmmm," came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.
