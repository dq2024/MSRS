  He let the
  thought run
around through his head, savoring
it with mental taste buds.
He would not kill her tonight. No,
nor the next night. He would wait,
wait until he had sucked the last
measure of pleasure from the
thought.
  
 
  It was like having a bottle of
rare old wine on a shelf where it
could be viewed daily. It was like
being able to pause again and
again before the bottle, hold it up
to the light, and say to it, "Some
day, when my desire for you has
reached the ultimate, I shall unstopper
you quietly and sip you
slowly to the last soul-satisfying
drop." As long as the bottle remained
there upon the shelf it was
symbolic of that pleasurable moment....
  
 
  He snapped out of his reverie
and realized he had been wasting
precious moments. There would be
time enough tomorrow for gloating.
Tonight, there were other
things to do. Pleasurable things.
He remembered the girl he had
met the night before, and smiled
smugly. Perhaps she would be
awaiting him even now. If not,
there would be another one....
  
 
  He settled himself deeper into
the chair, glanced once more at his
wife, then let his head lean comfortably
back against the chair's
headrest. His hand upon his thigh
felt the thin mesh that cloaked his
body beneath his clothing like a
sheer stocking. His fingers went
again to the tiny switch. Again he
hesitated.
  
 
  Herbert Hyrel knew no more
about the telporter suit he wore
than he did about the radio in the
corner, the TV set against the wall,
or the personalized telovis his wife
was wearing. You pressed one of
the buttons on the radio; music
came out. You pressed a button
and clicked a dial on the TV;
music and pictures came out. You
pressed a button and made an adjustment
on the telovis; three-dimensional,
emotion-colored pictures
leaped into the room. You
pressed a tiny switch on the telporter
suit; you were whisked away to
a receiving set you had previously
set up in secret.
  
 
  He knew that the music and the
images of the performers on the
TV and telovis were brought to his
room by some form of electrical impulse
or wave while the actual musicians
and performers remained in
the studio. He knew that when he
pressed the switch on his thigh
something within him—his ectoplasm,
higher self, the thing spirits
use for materialization, whatever
its real name—streamed out of him
along an invisible channel, leaving
his body behind in the chair in a
conscious but dream-like state. His
other self materialized in a small
cabin in a hidden nook between a
highway and a river where he had
installed the receiving set a month
ago.
  
 
  He thought once more of the girl
who might be waiting for him,
smiled, and pressed the switch.
