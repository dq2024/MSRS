  He was
  still weak days later when
Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,
  
 
  "Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you
what they thought was sure death, and it's
the only thing that kept you going long
enough to warn us."
  
 
  "I was dumb for a long time," Karyl said.
"I thought that it was the acid, almost to
the very last. But when I drank that last
glass, I knew they didn't have a chance.
  
 
  "They were metal monsters. No wonder
they feared that liquid. It would rust their
joints, short their wiring, and kill them.
No wonder they stared when I kept alive
after drinking enough to completely annihilate
a half-dozen of them.
  
 
  "But what happened when you met the
ship?"
  
 
  The space captain grinned.
  
 
  "Not much. Our crew was busy creating
a hollow shell filled with
   
   water
   
  to be shot
out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile
thrower.
  
 
  "These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put
traction beams on us and started tugging us
toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of
atomic shots but when they just glanced off,
we gave up.
  
 
  "They weren't expecting the shell of
water. When it hit that blue ship, you could
almost see it oxidize before your eyes.
  
 
  "I guess they knew what was wrong right
away. They let go the traction beams and
tried to get away. They forgot about the
force field, so we just poured atomic fire
into the weakening ship. It just melted
away."
  
 
  Jon Karyl got up from the divan where
he'd been lying. "They thought I was a
metal creature, too. But where do you suppose
they came from?"
  
 
  The captain shrugged. "Who knows?"
  
 
  Jon set two glasses on the table.
  
 
  "Have a drink of the best damn water in
the solar system?" He asked Capt. Small.
  
 
  "Don't mind if I do."
  
 
  The water twinkled in the two glasses,
winking as if it knew just what it had
done.
