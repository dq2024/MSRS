Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,
he lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't
have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.
Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the
psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what
they purported to be.
  
 
  Only one question of importance remained:
  
 
  What year was this?
  
 
  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of
jubilation and excitement. The
   
   future
   
  ! Here was the opportunity for
the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.
  
 
  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering
cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.
Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked
beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of
Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars
and returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel
could reach the stars!
  
 
  And
   
   he
   
  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend
his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the
challenging spaceways between the solar worlds.
  
 
  "I'm adaptable," he told himself gleefully. "I can learn fast. There'll
be a job for me out there...."
  
 
 
   If—
   
 
 
  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat
in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a
way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man
realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still
wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The
fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,
but—
  
 
  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.
