   A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course
    
   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared
    
   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble!
   
 
 
 
  The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.
She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of
translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise—or
had it been the chairman of the board?—back several thousand dollars.
Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked
with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely
on top and tight around the hips.
  
 
  After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.
  
 
  She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. "Hello-o, there,"
she said automatically. "So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just
taking a bath and—Oh. It's you."
  
 
  Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. "Holy Success," he whispered
in awe. "You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?"
  
 
 
 
  "Well, hurry up with whatever it is," snapped Peri. "I got a date
tonight."
  
 
  "I'll say you do! With a Martian!"
