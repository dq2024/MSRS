  Mr. Dawes
  came home an
hour later, looking tired.
Mom pecked him lightly on
the forehead. He glanced at
the evening paper, and then
spoke to Sol.
  
 
  "Hear you been asking
questions, Mr. Becker."
  
 
  Sol nodded, embarrassed.
"Guess I have. I'm awfully
curious about this Armagon
place. Never heard of anything
like it before."
  
 
  Dawes grunted. "You ain't
a reporter?"
  
 
  "Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I
was just satisfying my own
curiosity."
  
 
  "Uh-huh." Dawes looked
reflective. "You wouldn't be
thinkin' about writing us up
or anything. I mean, this is a
pretty private affair."
  
 
  "Writing it up?" Sol
blinked. "I hadn't thought of
it. But you'll have to admitâ€”it's
sure interesting."
  
 
  "Yeah," Dawes said narrowly.
"I guess it would be."
  
 
  "Supper!" Mom called.
  
 
  After the meal, they spent
a quiet evening at home. Sally
went to bed, screaming her
reluctance, at eight-thirty.
Mom, dozing in the big chair
near the fireplace, padded upstairs
at nine. Then Dawes
yawned widely, stood up, and
said goodnight at quarter-of-ten.
  
 
  He paused in the doorway
before leaving.
  
 
  "I'd think about that," he
said. "Writing it up, I mean.
A lot of folks would think
you were just plum crazy."
  
 
  Sol laughed feebly. "I
guess they would at that."
  
 
  "Goodnight," Dawes said.
  
 
  "Goodnight."
  
 
  He read Sally's copy of
   
   Treasure Island
   
  for about
half an hour. Then he undressed,
made himself comfortable
on the sofa, snuggled
under the soft blanket
that Mom had provided, and
shut his eyes.
  
 
  He reviewed the events of
the day before dropping off
to sleep. The troublesome
Sally. The strange dream
world of Armagon. The visit
to the barber shop. The removal
of Brundage's body.
The conversations with the
townspeople. Dawes' suspicious
attitude ...
  
 
  Then sleep came.
