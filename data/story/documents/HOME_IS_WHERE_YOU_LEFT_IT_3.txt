Steve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could
find some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way
he felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists,
trekking across a parched wilderness—to the safety of Oasis City—or
death.
  
 
  "Come on," Steve said, making up his mind. "The unicopter can hold two
in a pinch."
  
 
  "You're going after them?"
  
 
  "I've got to. They're my people. I've been away too long."
  
 
  "Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember."
  
 
  "Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell."
  
 
  "I'm not going anyplace, young fellow."
  
 
  "But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without—"
  
 
  "I'm staying," the old man said, still without self-pity, just
matter-of-factly. "The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame
'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good,
long life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll
need every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?"
  
 
  "No," Steve said.
  
 
  "Too bad. Well, good-bye and good luck."
  
 
  "But you can't—"
  
 
  "Oh, I'm staying. I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home
I'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow."
  
 
  Slowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small
metal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It
could do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet.
