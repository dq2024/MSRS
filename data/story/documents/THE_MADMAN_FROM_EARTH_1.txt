hour since I got here—"
  
 
  "You can't offend the Groaci," Miss Meuhl said sharply. "Consul Whaffle
would never have been so rude."
  
 
  "Whaffle left here three months ago," Retief said, "leaving me in

  "Are you leaving the office?" Miss Meuhl adjusted her glasses. "I have
some important letters here for your signature."
  
 
  "I don't recall dictating any letters today, Miss Meuhl," Retief said,
pulling on a light cape.
