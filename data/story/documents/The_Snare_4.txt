My eyes were on the circular opening. A metal panel emerged from a
recess on one side and slid across the passage. The room darkened with
the absence of starlight.
  
 
  "
   
   What happened?
   
  "
  
 
  "The door to this damned place closed," I explained.
  
 
  "
   
   What?
   
  "
  
 
  Before we could recover from the shock, the room filled with a
brilliant glare. We turned off our lamps.
  
 
  The room was approximately twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The
ceiling was only a few inches above our heads and when I looked at the
smooth, hard metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault.
  
 
  The walls of the room were covered with strange drawings and
instruments. Here and there, kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhythmically.
  
 
  Kane brushed past me and beat his gloved fists against the metal door
that had imprisoned us.
  
 
  "Miller!"
  
 
  "Yes?"
  
 
  "See if you can get this thing open from the outside."
  
 
  I knelt before the door and explored its surface with my fingers. There
were no visible recesses or controls.
  
 
  Over the intercom network, everyone's breath mingled and formed a
rough, harsh sound. I could discern the women's quick, frightened
breaths that were almost sobs. Kane's breath was deep and strong;
Miller's was faltering and weak.
  
 
  "Miller, get help!"
  
 
  "I'llâ€”" The sound of his breathing ceased. We listened intently.
  
 
  "What happened to him?"
  
 
  "I'll phone Lunar City." My fingers fumbled at the radio controls and
trembled beneath the thick gloves.
  
 
  I turned the dials that would connect my radio with Lunar City....
  
 
  Static grated against my ear drums.
  
 
 
   Static!
