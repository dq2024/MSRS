Dotty suddenly began to turn and toss, and a look of terror came over
her sleeping face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively.
  
 
  The child's lips worked and Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy words:
"They've found out where we're hiding. They're coming to get us. No!
Please, no!"
  
 
  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at
the same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an
agent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an
expression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She
touched the child's hand.
  
 
  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come
awake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in
a smile.
  
 
  "Hello," she said sleepily. "I've been having such funny dreams." Then,
after a pause, frowning, "I really am a god, you know. It feels very
queer."
  
 
  "Yes, dear?" Celeste prompted uneasily. "Shall I call Frieda?"
  
 
  The smile left Dotty's lips. "Why do you act so nervous around me?" she
asked. "Don't you love me, Mummy?"
  
 
  Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her
face broke into a radiant smile. "Of course I do, darling. I love you
very much."
  
 
  Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.
  
 
  There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste
heard her name called. She stood up.
  
 
  "I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others," she said. "If
you want me, dear, just call."
  
 
  "Yes, Mummy."
