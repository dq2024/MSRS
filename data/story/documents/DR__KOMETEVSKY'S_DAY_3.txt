   I am a God
   
  , Dotty was dreaming,
   
   and I want to be by myself and
think. I and my god-friends like to keep some of our thoughts secret,
but the other gods have forbidden us to.
   
 
 
  A little smile flickered across the lips of the sleeping girl, and
the woman in gold tights and gold-spangled jacket leaned forward
thoughtfully. In her dignity and simplicity and straight-spined grace,
she was rather like a circus mother watching her sick child before she
went out for the trapeze act.
  
 
 
   I and my god-friends sail off in our great round silver boats
   
  , Dotty
went on dreaming.
   
   The other gods are angry and scared. They are
frightened of the thoughts we may think in secret. They follow us to
hunt us down. There are many more of them than of us.
