  THE PERSONNEL Manager wore a perfectly-tailored suit. He strode across
the lobby floor toward Ish, his hand outstretched.
  
 
  "Martin Isherwood!" he exclaimed enthusiastically. "I'm
   
   very
   
  glad to
meet you!"
  
 
  "I'll bet," Ish said dryly, giving the Personnel Manager's hand a short
shake. "I've got other ideas. I want out."
  
 
  "That's all he's been saying for the past forty-five minutes, Sir," the
Receptionist said from behind her desk.
  
 
  The Personnel Manager frowned. "Um. Yes. Well, that's not unprecedented."
  
 
  "But hardly usual," he added.
  
 
  Ish found himself liking the man. He had a job to do, and after the
preliminary formality of the greeting had been passed, he was ready to
buckle down to it. Oh, he—shucks?—the Receptionist wasn't such a bad
girl, either. He smiled at her. "Sorry I lost my head," he said.
  
 
  She smiled back. "It happens."
  
 
  He took time to give her one more smile and a half-wink, and swung back
to the Personnel Manager.
  
 
  "Now. Let's get this thing straightened out. I've got—" He stopped to
look at his watch. "Six hours and a few minutes. They're fueling the
beast right now."
  
 
  "Do you know how much red tape you'd have to cut?"
  
 
  Ish shook his head. "I don't want to sound nasty, but that's your
problem."
  
 
  The Personnel Manager hesitated. "Look—you feel you've got a job
unfinished. Or, anyway, that's the way you'd put it. But, let's face
it—that's not really what's galling you. It's not really the job, is
it? It's just that you think you've been cheated out of what you devoted
your life to."
  
 
  Ish could feel his jaw muscles bunching. "Don't put words in my mouth!"
he snapped. "Just get me back, and we'll split hairs about it when I get
around this way again." Suddenly, he found himself pleading. "All I need
is a week," he said. "It'll be a rough week—no picnic, no pleasures of
the flesh. No smoking, no liquor. I certainly won't be breaking any
laws. One week. Get there, putter around for two days, and back again.
Then, you can do anything you want to—as long as it doesn't look like
the trip's responsible, of course."
  
 
  The Personnel Manager hesitated. "Suppose—" he began, but Ish
interrupted him.
  
 
  "Look, they need it, down there. They've got to have a target, someplace
to go. We're built for it. People have to have—but what am I telling
   
   you
   
  for. If you don't know, who does?"
  
 
  The Personnel Manager smiled. "I was about to say something."
  
 
  Ish stopped, abashed. "Sorry."
  
 
  He waved the apology away with a short movement of his hand. "You've got
to understand that what you've been saying isn't a valid claim. If it
were, human history would be very different, wouldn't it?"
  
 
  "Suppose I showed you something, first? Then, you could decide whether
you want to stay, after all."
  
 
  "How long's it going to take?" Ish flushed under the memory of having
actually begged for something.
  
 
  "Not long," the Personnel Manager said. He half-turned and pointed up at
the Earth, hanging just beyond the wall of the crater in which they were
suddenly standing.
  
 
  "Earth," the Personnel Manager said.
  
 
  Somehow, Ish was not astonished. He looked up at the Earth, touched by
cloud and sunlight, marked with ocean and continent, crowned with ice.
The unblinking stars filled the night.
  
 
  He looked around him. The Moon was silent—quiet, patient, waiting.
Somewhere, a metal glint against the planet above, if it were only large
enough to be seen, was the Station, and the ship for which the Moon had
waited.
  
 
  Ish walked a short distance. He was leaving no tracks in the pumice the
ages had sown. But it was the way he had thought of it, nevertheless. It
was the way the image had slowly built up in his mind, through the
years, through the training, through the work. It was what he had aimed
the
   
   Navion
   
  at, that day over the Everglades.
  
 
  "It's not the same," he said.
  
 
  The Personnel Manager sighed.
  
 
  "Don't you see," Ish said, "It
   
   can't
   
  be the same. I didn't push the
beast up here. There wasn't any
   
   feel
   
  to it. There wasn't any sound of
rockets."
  
 
  The Personnel Manager sighed again. "There wouldn't be, you know. Taking
off from the Station, landing here—vacuum."
  
 
  Ish shook his head. "There'd still be a sound. Maybe not for anybody
else to hear—and, maybe, maybe there
   
   would
   
  be. There'd be people,
back on Earth, who'd hear it."
  
 
  "All right," the Personnel Manager said. His face was grave, but his
eyes were shining a little.
