  Dear Joe:
  
 
  Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages
in my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.
Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here
"revolting" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are
all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most
important part of my journey—completion of the weapon against the
not-worlders—I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that
day, I assure you.
