  Mrs. Herbert Hyrel
  removed
the telovis from her
head and laid it carefully aside.
She uncoiled her long legs from beneath
her, walked to her husband's
chair, and stood for a long moment
looking down at him, her lips
drawn back in contempt. Then she
bent over him and reached down
his thigh until her fingers contacted
the small switch.
  
 
  Seconds later, a slight tremor
shook Hyrel's body. His eyes
snapped open, air escaped his lungs,
his lower jaw sagged inanely, and
his head lolled to one side.
  
 
  She stood a moment longer,
watching his eyes become glazed
and sightless. Then she walked to
the telephone.
  
 
  "Police?" she said. "This is Mrs.
Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible
has happened to my husband.
Please come over immediately.
Bring a doctor."
  
 
  She hung up, went to her bathroom,
stripped off her clothing,
and slid carefully out of her telporter
suit. This she folded neatly
and tucked away into the false back
of the medicine cabinet. She found
a fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas
and got into them.
  
 
  She was just arriving back into
the living room, tying the cord of
her dressing gown about her slim
waist, when she heard the sound of
the police siren out front.
