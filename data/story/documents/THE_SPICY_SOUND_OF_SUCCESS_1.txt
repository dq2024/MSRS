   Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew
    
   less than the crew—all their lives hung upon it!
   
 
 
 
  There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were
looking at it so analytically.
  
 
  "Transphasia, that's what it is," Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with
a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. "You can take my
word on that, Captain Gavin."
  
 
  "Can't," I told him. "I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust
   
   anything
   
  . That's why I'm Captain."
  
 
  "You'll get over feeling like that."
  
 
  "I know. Then I'll become First Officer."
  
 
  "But look at that screen, sir," Quade said with an emphatic swing of
his scarred arm. "I've seen blank scanning like that before and you
haven't—it's your first trip. This always means transphasia—cortex
dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect—call it anything
you like, it's still transphasia."
  
 
  "I know what transphasia is," I said moderately. "It means an
electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling
it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also
effects electronic equipment, like radar and television."
  
 
  "Obviously." Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.
  
 
  "Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many
planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope
may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives."
  
 
  "You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never
interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us
they can't even recognize our existence."
