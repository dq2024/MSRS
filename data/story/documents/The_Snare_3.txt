We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane
shouted, "Look!"
  
 
  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken
by a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and
flashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.
  
 
  "There's a small room inside," he told us, and climbed through the
opening.
  
 
  We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening
to give him as much light as possible.
  
 
  "Come on in, Marie," he called to his wife. "This is really something!
It
   
   must
   
  be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the
walls and gadgets that look like controls for something...."
  
 
  Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features
struggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the
alienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She
hesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.
  
 
  "You want to go in?" my wife asked.
  
 
  "Do you?"
  
 
  "Let's."
  
 
  I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned
to help Miller.
  
 
  Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert
mentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help
him as he stepped into the passageway.
  
 
  For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette
against the star-studded sky.
  
 
  The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped
with pain when he struck the ground. "
   
   Something
   
  pushed me!"
  
 
  "Are you all right?"
  
 
  "Yes."
  
 
  He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through
the passage....
  
 
  ... and struck an invisible solid wall.
