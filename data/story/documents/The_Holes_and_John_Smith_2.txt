 
  It all began on a Saturday
night at
   
   The Space Room
   
  . If
you've seen any recent Martian
travel folders, you know the place:
"A picturesque oasis of old Martian
charm, situated on the beauteous
Grand Canal in the heart of
Marsport. Only half a mile from
historic Chandler Field, landing
site of the first Martian expedition
nearly fifty years ago in 1990. A
visitor to the hotel, lunch room or
cocktail lounge will thrill at the
sight of hardy space pioneers mingling
side by side with colorful
Martian tribesmen. An evening at
   
   The Space Room
   
  is an amazing,
unforgettable experience."
  
 
  Of course, the folders neglect to
add that the most amazing aspect is
the scent of the Canal's stagnant
water—and that the most unforgettable
experience is seeing the "root-of-all-evil"
evaporate from your
pocketbook like snow from the
Great Red Desert.
  
 
  We were sitting on the bandstand
of the candle-lit cocktail lounge.
Me—Jimmie Stanley—and my
four-piece combo. Maybe you've
seen our motto back on Earth:
"The Hottest Music This Side of
Mercury."
  
 
  But there weren't four of us tonight.
Only three. Ziggy, our bass
fiddle man, had nearly sliced off
two fingers while opening a can of
Saturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing
the number of our personnel by a
tragic twenty-five per cent.
  
 
  Which was why Ke-teeli, our
boss, was descending upon us with
all the grace of an enraged Venusian
vinosaur.
  
 
  "Where ees museek?" he shrilled
in his nasal tenor. He was almost
skeleton thin, like most Martians,
and so tall that if he fell down he'd
be half way home.
  
 
  I gulped. "Our bass man can't
be here, but we've called the Marsport
local for another. He'll be here
any minute."
  
 
  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to
as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered
coldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.
His eyes were like black
needle points set deep in a mask of
dry, ancient, reddish leather.
  
 
  "Ees no feedle man, ees no job,"
he squeaked.
  
 
  I sighed. This was the week our
contract ended. Goon-Face had displayed
little enough enthusiasm for
our music as it was. His comments
were either, "Ees too loud, too fast,"
or "Ees too slow, too soft." The real
cause of his concern being, I suspected,
the infrequency with which
his cash register tinkled.
  
 
  "But," I added, "even if the new
man doesn't come,
   
   we're
   
  still here.
We'll play for you." I glanced at
the conglomeration of uniformed
spacemen, white-suited tourists,
and loin-clothed natives who sat at
ancient stone tables. "You wouldn't
want to disappoint your customers,
would you?"
  
 
  Ke-teeli snorted. "Maybe ees better
dey be deesappointed. Ees better
no museek den bad museek."
  
 
  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles
on Martian horn-harp, made a
feeble attempt at optimism. "Don't
worry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass
man will be here."
  
 
  "Sure," said Hammer-Head, our
red-haired vibro-drummer. "I think
I hear him coming now."
  
 
  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the
entrance. There was only silence.
His naked, parchment-like chest
swelled as if it were an expanding
balloon.
  
 
  "Five meenutes!" he shrieked.
"Eef no feedle, den you go!" And
he whirled away.
  
 
  We waited.
  
 
  Fat Boy's two hundred and
eighty-odd pounds were drooped
over his chair like the blubber of an
exhausted, beach-stranded whale.
  
 
  "Well," he muttered, "there's always
the uranium pits of Neptune.
Course, you don't live more than
five years there—"
  
 
  "Maybe we could make it back
to Lunar City," suggested Hammer-Head.
  
 
  "Using what for fare?" I asked.
"Your brains?"
  
 
  Hammer-Head groaned. "No. I
guess it'll have to be the black pits
of Neptune. The home of washed-up
interplanetary musicians. It's too
bad. We're so young, too."
  
 
  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli
was casting his razor-edged glare in
our direction. I brushed the chewed
finger nails from the keyboard of
my electronic piano.
  
 
  Then it happened.
