  Dear Joe:
  
 
  This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time. I must pick
closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but
failure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula
that is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were
filled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.
  
 
  I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I
realized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction
that inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there
immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not
aware of the nature of my activities.
  
 
  I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I
stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered
into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager
I was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best
customer.
  
 
  "But why, sir?" he asked plaintively.
  
 
  I was baffled. What could I tell him?
  
 
  "Don't you like the rooms?" he persisted. "Isn't the service good?"
  
 
  "It's the rooms," I told him. "They're—they're—"
  
 
  "They're what?" he wanted to know.
  
 
  "They're not safe."
  
 
  "Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is...."
  
 
  At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.
  
 
  "See?" I screamed. "Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!"
  
 
  He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.
Another day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like
the not-men, curse them.
