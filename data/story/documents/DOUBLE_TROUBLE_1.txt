 
  DOUBLE TROUBLE
  
 
  by CARL JACOBI
  
 
  Grannie Annie, that waspish science-fiction
   
  writer, was in a jam again. What with red-spot
   
  fever, talking cockatoos and flagpole trees,
   
  I was running in circlesâ€”especially since
   
  Grannie became twins every now and then.

  We had left the offices of
   
   Interstellar Voice
   
  three days ago, Earth
time, and now as the immense disc of Jupiter flamed across the sky,
entered the outer limits of the Baldric. Grannie Annie strode in the
lead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place in
this desert as the trees.
  
 
  Flagpole trees. They rose straight up like enormous cat-tails, with
only a melon-shaped protuberance at the top to show they were a form of
vegetation. Everything else was blanketed by the sand and the powerful
wind that blew from all quarters.
  
 
  As we reached the first of those trees, Grannie came to a halt.
  
 
  "This is the Baldric all right. If my calculations are right, we've hit
it at its narrowest spot."
  
 
  Ezra Karn took a greasy pipe from his lips and spat. "It looks like the
rest of this God-forsaken moon," he said, "'ceptin for them sticks."
  
 
  Xartal, the Martian illustrator, said nothing. He was like that,
taciturn, speaking only when spoken to.
  
 
  He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third day
on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us.
