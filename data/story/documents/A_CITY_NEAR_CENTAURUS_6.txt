When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.
  
 
  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in
the sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,
familiar to Michaelson.
  
 
  Michaelson asked, "Did you sleep well?"
  
 
  "No."
  
 
  "I'm sorry to hear that."
  
 
  "How do you feel?"
  
 
  "Fine, but my head aches a little."
  
 
  "Sorry," Maota said.
  
 
  "For what?"
  
 
  "For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you."
  
 
  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. "What kind of man are you? First you try
to break my skull, then you apologize."
  
 
  "I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright."
  
 
  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.
  
 
  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked
like a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its
appearance. It was a deadly weapon.
  
 
 
 
  "Well," he said, "before you kill me, tell me about the book." He held
it up for Maota to see.
  
 
  "What about the book?"
  
 
  "What kind of book is it?"
  
 
  "What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what
   
   kind
   
  of book? You have seen it. It
is like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it
talks."
  
 
  "No, no. I mean, what's in it?"
  
 
  "Poetry."
  
 
  "Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?
Why not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a
subject worthy of a book."
  
 
  Maota shook his head. "One does not study a dead culture to learn how
they made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must
kill you now, so I can get some rest."
  
 
  The old man raised the gun.
