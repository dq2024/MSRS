I took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our
steps.
  
 
  We had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors
opened soundlessly.
  
 
  Verana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.
  
 
  Six doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the
ones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.
  
 
  This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.
  
 
  I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.
  
 
  The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing
thousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four
chairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each
chair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting
column.
  
 
  "Ed!" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a
trembling finger at some crude drawings. "The things in this room are
food!"
  
 
  The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.
The first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and
bottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening
the containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes
and the woman drinking from a bottle.
  
 
 
 
  "Let's see how it tastes," I said.
  
 
  I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my
fingers.
  
 
  The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.
  
 
  I tasted a small piece.
  
 
  "Chocolate! Just like chocolate!"
  
 
  Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.
  
 
  "Milk!" she exclaimed.
  
 
  "Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms," I told her.
