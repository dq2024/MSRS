  THE GIANTS RETURN
  
 
  By ROBERT ABERNATHY
  
 
  Earth set itself grimly to meet them with
   
  corrosive fire, determined to blast them
   
  back to the stars. But they erred in thinking
   
  the Old Ones were too big to be clever.

  In the last hours the star ahead had grown brighter by many magnitudes,
and had changed its color from a dazzling blue through white to the
normal yellow, of a GO sun. That was the Doppler effect as the star's
radial velocity changed relative to the
   
   Quest III
   
  , as for forty hours
the ship had decelerated.
  
 
  They had seen many such stars come near out of the galaxy's glittering
backdrop, and had seen them dwindle, turn red and go out as the
   
   Quest
III
   
  drove on its way once more, lashed by despair toward the speed of
light, leaving behind the mockery of yet another solitary and lifeless
luminary unaccompanied by worlds where men might dwell. They had grown
sated with the sight of wondersâ€”of multiple systems of giant stars, of
nebulae that sprawled in empty flame across light years.
  
 
  But now unwonted excitement possessed the hundred-odd members of the
   
   Quest III's
   
  crew. It was a subdued excitement; men and women, they
came and stood quietly gazing into the big vision screens that showed
the oncoming star, and there were wide-eyed children who had been born
in the ship and had never seen a planet. The grownups talked in low
voices, in tones of mingled eagerness and apprehension, of what might
lie at the long journey's end. For the
   
   Quest III
   
  was coming home; the
sun ahead was
   
   the
   
  Sun, whose rays had warmed their lives' beginning.
