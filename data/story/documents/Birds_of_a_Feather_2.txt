Broadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand
languages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really
packs in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It's the best of its kind,
the only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the
other species of the universe.
  
 
  The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, "The first
applicant is ready to see you, sir."
  
 
  "Send him, her or it in."
  
 
  The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on
nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a
big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and
five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.
There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,
one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.
  
 
 
 
  His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. "You are Mr. Corrigan?"
  
 
  "That's right." I reached for a data blank. "Before we begin, I'll need
certain information aboutâ€”"
  
 
  "I am a being of Regulus II," came the grave, booming reply, even
before I had picked up the blank. "I need no special care and I am not
a fugitive from the law of any world."
  
 
  "Your name?"
  
 
  "Lawrence R. Fitzgerald."
  
 
  I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick
cough. "Let me have that again, please?"
  
 
  "Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for
Raymond."
  
 
  "Of course, that's not the name you were born with."
  
 
  The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,
remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of
an apologetic smile. "My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and
shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see."
