  At
  the table, Dawes
asked his destination.
  
 
  "Wedding in Salinas," he
explained. "Old Army friend
of mine. I picked this hitchhiker
up about two miles from
here. He
   
   seemed
   
  okay."
  
 
  "Never can tell," Dawes
said placidly, munching egg.
"Hey, Ma. That why you
were so late comin' to court
last night?"
  
 
  "That's right, Pa." She
poured the blackest coffee
Sol had ever seen. "Didn't
miss much, though."
  
 
  "What court is that?" Sol
asked politely, his mouth full.
  
 
  "Umagum," Sally said, a
piece of toast sticking out
from the side of her mouth.
"Don't you know
   
   nothin'
   
  ?"
  
 
  "
   
   Arma
   
  gon," Dawes corrected.
He looked sheepishly at
the stranger. "Don't expect
Mister—" He cocked an eyebrow.
"What's the name?"
  
 
  "Becker."
  
 
  "Don't expect Mr. Becker
knows anything about Armagon.
It's just a dream, you
know." He smiled apologetically.
  
 
  "Dream? You mean this—Armagon
is a place you dream
about?"
  
 
  "Yep," Dawes said. He lifted
cup to lip. "Great coffee,
Ma." He leaned back with a
contented sigh. "Dream about
it every night. Got so used to
the place, I get all confused
in the daytime."
  
 
  Mom said: "I get muddle-headed
too, sometimes."
  
 
  "You mean—" Sol put his
napkin in his lap. "You mean
   
   you
   
  dream about the same
place?"
  
 
  "Sure," Sally piped. "We
all go there at night. I'm goin'
to the palace again, too."
  
 
  "If you brush your teeth,"
Mom said primly.
  
 
  "If I brush my teeth. Boy,
you shoulda seen the exelution!"
  
 
  "Execution," her father
said.
  
 
  "Oh, my goodness!" Mom
got up hastily. "That reminds
me. I gotta call poor Mrs.
Brundage. It's the
   
   least
   
  I
could do."
  
 
  "Good idea," Dawes nodded.
"And I'll have to round
up some folks and get old
Brundage out of there."
  
 
  Sol was staring. He opened
his mouth, but couldn't think
of the right question to ask.
Then he blurted out: "What
execution?"
  
 
  "None of
   
   your
   
  business,"
the man said coldly. "You eat
up, young man. If you want
me to get Sheriff Coogan
lookin' for your car."
  
 
  The rest of the meal went
silently, except for Sally's insistence
upon singing her
school song between mouthfuls.
When Dawes was
through, he pushed back his
plate and ordered Sol to get
ready.
  
 
  Sol grabbed his topcoat and
followed the man out the
door.
  
 
  "Have to stop someplace
first," Dawes said. "But we'll
be pickin' up the Sheriff on
the way. Okay with you?"
  
 
  "Fine," Sol said uneasily.
  
 
  The rain had stopped, but
the heavy clouds seemed reluctant
to leave the skies over
the small town. There was a
skittish breeze blowing, and
Sol Becker tightened the collar
of his coat around his
neck as he tried to keep up
with the fast-stepping Dawes.
