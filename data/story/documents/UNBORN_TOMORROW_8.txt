  I decided the hell with it. I took
a cab to the airport, presented my return
ticket, told them I wanted to
leave on the first obtainable plane to
New York. I'd spent two days at the
   
   Oktoberfest
   
  , and I'd had it.
  
 
  I got more guff there. Something
was wrong with the ticket, wrong
date or some such. But they fixed
that up. I never was clear on what
was fouled up, some clerk's error,
evidently.
  
 
  The trip back was as uninteresting
as the one over. As the hangover began
to wear off—a little—I was almost
sorry I hadn't been able to stay.
If I'd only been able to get a room I
   
   would
   
  have stayed, I told myself.
  
 
  From Idlewild, I came directly to
the office rather than going to my
apartment. I figured I might as well
check in with Betty.
  
 
  I opened the door and there I
found Mr. Oyster sitting in the chair
he had been occupying four—or was
it five—days before when I'd left.
I'd lost track of the time.
  
 
  I said to him, "Glad you're here,
sir. I can report. Ah, what was it
you came for? Impatient to hear if
I'd had any results?" My mind was
spinning like a whirling dervish in
a revolving door. I'd spent a wad of
his money and had nothing I could
think of to show for it; nothing but
the last stages of a grand-daddy
hangover.
  
 
  "Came for?" Mr. Oyster snorted.
"I'm merely waiting for your girl to
make out my receipt. I thought you
had already left."
  
 
  "You'll miss your plane," Betty
said.
  
 
  There was suddenly a double dip
of ice cream in my stomach. I walked
over to my desk and looked down at
the calendar.
  
 
  Mr. Oyster was saying something
to the effect that if I didn't leave today,
it would have to be tomorrow,
that he hadn't ponied up that thousand
dollars advance for anything
less than immediate service. Stuffing
his receipt in his wallet, he fussed
his way out the door.
  
 
  I said to Betty hopefully, "I suppose
you haven't changed this calendar
since I left."
  
 
  Betty said, "What's the matter
with you? You look funny. How did
your clothes get so mussed? You tore
the top sheet off that calendar yourself,
not half an hour ago, just before
this marble-missing client came
in." She added, irrelevantly, "Time
travelers yet."
  
 
  I tried just once more. "Uh, when
did you first see this Mr. Oyster?"
  
 
  "Never saw him before in my
life," she said. "Not until he came
in this morning."
  
 
  "This morning," I said weakly.
  
 
  While Betty stared at me as though
it was
   
   me
   
  that needed candling by a
head shrinker preparatory to being
sent off to a pressure cooker, I fished
in my pocket for my wallet, counted
the contents and winced at the
pathetic remains of the thousand.
I said pleadingly, "Betty, listen,
how long ago did I go out that door—on
the way to the airport?"
  
 
  "You've been acting sick all morning.
You went out that door about
ten minutes ago, were gone about
three minutes, and then came back."
  
 
 
  "See here," Mr. Oyster said (interrupting
Simon's story), "did you
say this was supposed to be amusing,
young man? I don't find it so. In
fact, I believe I am being ridiculed."
  
 
  Simon shrugged, put one hand to
his forehead and said, "That's only
the first chapter. There are two
more."
  
 
  "I'm not interested in more," Mr.
Oyster said. "I suppose your point
was to show me how ridiculous the
whole idea actually is. Very well,
you've done it. Confound it. However,
I suppose your time, even when
spent in this manner, has some value.
Here is fifty dollars. And good day,
sir!"
  
 
  He slammed the door after him
as he left.
  
 
  Simon winced at the noise, took
the aspirin bottle from its drawer,
took two, washed them down with
water from the desk carafe.
  
 
  Betty looked at him admiringly.
Came to her feet, crossed over and
took up the fifty dollars. "Week's
wages," she said. "I suppose that's
one way of taking care of a crackpot.
But I'm surprised you didn't
take his money and enjoy that vacation
you've been yearning about."
  
 
  "I did," Simon groaned. "Three
times."
  
 
  Betty stared at him. "You mean—"
  
 
  Simon nodded, miserably.
  
 
  She said, "But
   
   Simon
   
  . Fifty thousand
dollars bonus. If that story was
true, you should have gone back
again to Munich. If there was one
time traveler, there might have
been—"
  
 
  "I keep telling you," Simon said
bitterly, "I went back there three
times. There were hundreds of them.
Probably thousands." He took a deep
breath. "Listen, we're just going to
have to forget about it. They're not
going to stand for the space-time
continuum track being altered. If
something comes up that looks like
it might result in the track being
changed, they set you right back at
the beginning and let things start—for
you—all over again. They just
can't allow anything to come back
from the future and change the
past."
  
 
  "You mean," Betty was suddenly
furious at him, "you've given up!
Why this is the biggest thing— Why
the fifty thousand dollars is nothing.
The future! Just think!"
  
 
  Simon said wearily, "There's just
one thing you can bring back with
you from the future, a hangover compounded
of a gallon or so of Marzenbräu.
What's more you can pile
one on top of the other, and another
on top of that!"
  
 
  He shuddered. "If you think I'm
going to take another crack at this
merry-go-round and pile a fourth
hangover on the three I'm already
nursing, all at once, you can think
again."
