Bullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. "No fog about this!
You're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract,
but you do what I say!"
  
 
  "Why, the man thinks he owns you." Ann laughed shakily.
  
 
  "You'll find my barmen know their law," Bullen said. "This isn't the
way I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your
knowledge."
  
 
  Kersey said politely, "You are here illegally, with no immigrate
permit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen
has taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can
make a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you
to live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?"
  
 
  Jeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He
wondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange
streets. But he put on a bold front.
  
 
  "I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work
for you," he said. "My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and
stop us, legally or any other way."
  
 
  Kersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen
chuckled deep in his throat. "Good pop and bang. Like to see it. Go
on, walk out. You hang in trouble, call up here—Butterfly 9, ask for
Bullen. Whole exchange us. I'll meet you here about eleven tomorrow
pre-noon."
  
 
  "Don't hold your breath. Let's go, Ann."
  
 
  When they were on the sidewalk, Ann took a deep breath. "We made it.
For a minute, I thought there'd be a brawl. Why did they let us go?"
  
 
  "No telling. Maybe they're harmless lunatics—or practical jokers." He
looked over his shoulder as they walked down the street, but there was
no sign of pursuit. "It's a long time since supper."
