Opperly looked at him with a gentle appraisal. "You're a strong and
vital man, Willard, with a strong man's prides and desires." His voice
trailed off for a bit. Then, "Excuse me, Willard, but wasn't there a
girl once? A Miss Arkady?"
  
 
  Farquar's ungainly figure froze. He nodded curtly, face averted.
  
 
  "And didn't she go off with a Thinker?"
  
 
  "If girls find me ugly, that's their business," Farquar said harshly,
still not looking at Opperly. "What's that got to do with this
invitation?"
  
 
  Opperly didn't answer the question. His eyes got more distant. Finally
he said, "In my day we had it a lot easier. A scientist was an
academician, cushioned by tradition."
  
 
  Willard snorted. "Science had already entered the era of the police
inspectors, with laboratory directors and political appointees stifling
enterprise."
  
 
  "Perhaps," Opperly agreed. "Still, the scientist lived the safe,
restricted, highly respectable life of a university man. He wasn't
exposed to the temptations of the world."
  
 
  Farquar turned on him. "Are you implying that the Thinkers will somehow
be able to buy me off?"
  
 
  "Not exactly."
  
 
  "You think I'll be persuaded to change my aims?" Farquar demanded
angrily.
  
 
  Opperly shrugged his helplessness. "No, I don't think you'll change
your aims."
  
 
  Clouds encroaching from the west blotted the parallelogram of sunlight
between the two men.
