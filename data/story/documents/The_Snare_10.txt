Verana snapped her fingers. "So that's why the aliens read Marie's
mind! They wanted to learn our language so they could talk to us!"
  
 
  Kane whirled in a complete circle, glaring at each of the four walls.
"Where are you?
   
   Who
   
  are you?"
  
 
  "I'm located in a part of the ship you can't reach. I'm a machine."
  
 
  "Is anyone else aboard besides ourselves?"
  
 
  "No. I control the ship." Although the voice spoke without stilted
phrases, the tone was cold and mechanical.
  
 
  "What are yourâ€”your masters going to do with us?" Marie asked
anxiously.
  
 
  "You won't be harmed. My masters merely wish to question and examine
you. Thousands of years ago, they wondered what your race would be like
when it developed to the space-flight stage. They left this ship on
your Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity
toward your race, only compassion and curiosity."
  
 
  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship
and asked the machine, "Why didn't you let our fifth member board the
ship?"
  
 
  "The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,
oxygen and living facilities for four only of your race. I had to
prevent the fifth from entering the ship."
  
 
  "Come on," Kane ordered. "We'll search this ship room by room and we'll
find some way to make it take us back to Earth."
  
 
  "It's useless," the ship warned us.
  
 
  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to
force our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.
The only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were
the containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or
hard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.
