Marge probably thought she'd really put me where I belonged, but the
laugh was on her, after all.
  
 
  As I said, the old Marge was never like the new one. Marge Prime makes

sad by comparison.
  
 
  She cooks like a dream and she always brings me my pipe and slippers.
As they say, there's nothing a man likes more than to be appreciated.
  
 
  A hundred per cent appreciated, with a factory guarantee to correct any
slippage, which would only be temporary, anyhow.
  
 
  One of these days, we'll take that second honeymoon. But I think we'll
go to Hawaii.
