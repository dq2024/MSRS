The land of the Fweep turned slowly on its axis. The orange sun set and
rose again and stared down once more at the meadow where the improbable
spaceship rested on its improbable stern. The sixteen Earth hours that
the rotation had taken had changed nothing inside the ship, either.
  
 
  Grampa looked up from his pircuit and said, "If I were you, Junior, I
would take a good look at the TV repairman when we get back to Earth.
   
   If
   
  we get back to Earth," he amended. "You can't be Four's father.
All over the Universe, gravity is the same, and if it's gravity, the
polarizer will polarize it."
  
 
  "That's just supposition," Junior said stubbornly. "The fact is, it
isn't because it doesn't. Q.E.D."
  
 
  "Maybe the polarizer is broken," Fred suggested.
  
 
  Grampa snorted. "Broken-shmoken. Nothing to break, Young Fred. Just a
few coils of copper wire and they're all right. We checked. We know
the power plant is working: the lights are on, the air and water
recirculation systems are going, the food resynthesizer is okay. And,
anyway, the polarizer could work from the storage battery if it had to."
  
 
  "Then it goes deeper," Junior insisted. "It goes right to the principle
of polarization itself. For some reason, it doesn't work here. Why?
Before we can discover the answer to that, we'll have to know more
about polarization itself. How does it work, Grampa?"
  
 
  Grampa gave him a sarcastic grin. "Now you're curious, eh? Couldn't
be bothered with Grampa's invention before. Oh, no! Too busy. Accept
without question the blessings that the Good Lord providethâ€”"
  
 
  "Let's not get up on any pulpits," Fred growled. "Come on, Grampa,
what's the theory behind polarization?"
  
 
  Grampa looked at the four faces staring at him hopefully and the
jeering grin turned to a smile. "Well," he said, "at last. You know
how light is polarized, eh?" The smile faded. "No, I guess you don't."
