I smiled at him gratefully; he was the only member of my family who
really seemed to like me in spite of my handicap. "It won't work, Tim.
I know you're trying to be kind, butâ€”"
  
 
  "He's not saying it just to be kind," my mother put in. "He means it.
Not that I want to arouse false hopes, Kevin," she added with grim
scrupulousness. "Tim's awfully young yet and I wouldn't trust his
extracurricular prognostications too far."
  
 
  Nonetheless, I couldn't help feeling a feeble renewal of old hopes.
After all, young or not, Tim was a hell of a good prognosticator; he
wouldn't have risen so rapidly to the position he held in the Weather
Bureau if he hadn't been pretty near tops in foreboding.
  
 
  Mother smiled sadly at my thoughts, but I didn't let that discourage
me. As Danny had said, she
   
   knew
   
  but she didn't really
   
   understand
   
  .
Nobody, for all of his or her psi power, really understood me.
