"Extrone wants to see you," Lin said.
  
 
  Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.
"What's he want to see
   
   me
   
  for?"
  
 
  "I don't know," Lin said curtly.
  
 
  Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously
at Lin's bare forearm. "Look," he whispered. "You know him. I have—a
little money. If you were able to ... if he wants," Ri gulped, "to
   
   do
   
  anything to me—I'd pay you, if you could...."
  
 
  "You better come along," Lin said, turning.
  
 
  Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,
ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where
Extrone was seated, petting his rifle.
  
 
  Extrone nodded genially. "The farn beast hunter, eh?"
  
 
  "Yes, sir."
  
 
  Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. "Tell me
what they look like," he said suddenly.
  
 
  "Well, sir, they're ... uh...."
  
 
  "Pretty frightening?"
  
 
  "No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir."
  
 
  "But
   
   you
   
  weren't afraid of them, were you?"
  
 
  "No, sir. No, because...."
  
 
  Extrone was smiling innocently. "Good. I want you to do something for
me."
  
 
  "I ... I...." Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.
Lin's face was impassive.
  
 
  "Of
   
   course
   
  you will," Extrone said genially. "Get me a rope, Lin. A
good, long, strong rope."
  
 
  "What are you going to do?" Ri asked, terrified.
  
 
  "Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as
bait."
  
 
  "No!"
  
 
  "Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream—you
   
   can
   
  scream,
by the way?"
  
 
  Ri swallowed.
  
 
  "We could find a way to make you."
  
 
  There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop,
creeping toward his nose.
  
 
  "You'll be safe," Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. "I'll
shoot the animal before it reaches you."
  
 
  Ri gulped for air. "But ... if there should be more than one?"
  
 
  Extrone shrugged.
  
 
  "I—Look, sir. Listen to me." Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands
were trembling. "It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir.
   
   He
   
  killed a farn beast before
   
   I
   
  did, sir. And last night—last
night, he—"
  
 
  "He what?" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.
  
 
  Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. "He said he ought to kill you, sir.
That's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.
He's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,
sir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I
wouldn't...."
  
 
  Extrone said, "Which one is he?"
  
 
  "That one. Right over there."
  
 
  "The one with his back to me?"
  
 
  "Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir."
  
 
  Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle
and said, "Here comes Lin with the rope, I see."
  
 
  Ri was greenish. "You ... you...."
  
 
  Extrone turned to Lin. "Tie one end around his waist."
  
 
  "Wait," Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. "You don't
want to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything
should happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it."
  
 
  "Tie it," Extrone ordered.
  
 
  "No, sir. Please. Oh,
   
   please
   
  don't, sir."
  
 
  "Tie it," Extrone said inexorably.
  
 
  Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.
