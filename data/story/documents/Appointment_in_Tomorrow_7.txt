Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out
a high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning
rollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that
of such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand
relays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,
impishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,
reaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room
where a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.
  
 
  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as
a stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first
question, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the
staccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the
answer.
  
 
  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon
and the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to
close his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,
asked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,
then went back to the grind.
  
 
  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his
thinking with his eyes open.
  
 
  The question was: "Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?"
  
 
  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive
lips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.
  
 
  Suddenly he began to tape again.
  
 
  "Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,
humorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:
The mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows...."
  
 
  But his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.
