   With never a moment to rest, the pursuit
    
   through space felt like a game of hounds
    
   and hares ... or was it follow the leader?
   
 
 
 
  Ben Curtis eased his pale, gaunt body through the open doorway of the
Blast Inn, the dead man following silently behind him.
  
 
  His fear-borne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian gin
mill. The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose
ingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets.
  
 
  Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco
smoke and the sweet, heavy fumes of Martian Devil's Egg. Here and
there, Ben saw moving figures. He could not tell if they were Earthmen,
Martians or Venusians.
  
 
  Someone tugged at his greasy coat. He jumped, thinking absurdly that it
was the dead man's hand.
  
 
  "
   
   Coma esta, senor?
   
  " a small voice piped. "
   
   Speken die Deutsch?
Desirez-vous d'amour? Da? Nyet?
   
  "
  
 
  Ben looked down.
  
 
  The speaker was an eager-eyed Martian boy of about ten. He was like
a red-skinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs, clad in a torn
skivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees.
  
 
  "I'm American," Ben muttered.
  
 
  "Ah,
   
   buena
   
  ! I speak English
   
   tres
   
  fine,
   
   senor
   
  . I have Martian
friend, she
   
   tres
   
  pretty and
   
   tres
   
  fat. She weigh almost eighty
pounds,
   
   monsieur
   
  . I take you to her,
   
   si
   
  ?"
  
 
  Ben shook his head.
