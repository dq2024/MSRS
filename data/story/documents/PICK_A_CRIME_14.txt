He lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car's plush ceiling.
"It's a great system, isn't it, Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk like
you is free to do what he wants, as long as it's legal."
  
 
  "I think it's a lousy, filthy system." Joe's head was still tingling
with pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it
was also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do
that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he
wanted to do and
   
   now
   
  ....
  
 
  Hendricks laughed. "You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean,
wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for
freaks like yourself, criminals areâ€”"
  
 
  "Let me out!" Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming
the door behind him before the car stopped completely.
  
 
  He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into
the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a
prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated
him back.
  
 
  He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and
voice prevented him.
  
 
  It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk.
