Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. "I haven't finished eating. Let's
chat with the gent." She added in an undertone to Jeff, "Must be a
psychoâ€”but sort of an inspired one."
  
 
  The man said to Ann, "You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.
I join you."
  
 
  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with
an easy grace that was almost arrogant.
  
 
  "You are unhappy in 1957," he went on. "Discouraged. Restless. Why not
take trip to another time?"
  
 
  "Why not?" Ann said gaily. "How much does it cost?"
  
 
  "Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we
talk money." He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.
  
 
  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:
  
 
  4-D TRAVEL BEURO
   
  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent
  
 
  "Mr. Snader's bureau is different," Jeff said to his wife. "He even
spells it different."
  
 
  Snader chuckled. "I come from other time. We spell otherwise."
  
 
  "You mean you come from the future?"
  
 
  "Just different time. I show you. You come with me?"
  
 
  "Come where?" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man
didn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and
force.
  
 
  "Come on little trip to different time," invited Snader. He added
persuasively, "Could be back here in hour."
  
 
  "It would be painless, I suppose?" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.
  
 
  "Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every
day. I look damaged?"
  
 
  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and
his nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff
politely agreed that he did not look damaged.
  
 
  Ann was enjoying this. "Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time
travel work?"
  
 
  "Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too
complicated." He flashed his white teeth. "You think time travel not
possible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather."
  
 
  Ann said, "Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips."
  
 
  "Invite many people," Snader said quickly. "Not expensive. You know
Missing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go
with me to other time. Many stay."
  
 
  "Oh, sure," Jeff said. "But how do you select the ones to invite?"
  
 
  "Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape."
