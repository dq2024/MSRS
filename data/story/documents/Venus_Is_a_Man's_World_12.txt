He cocked his head and considered a moment. "Look," he said finally,
"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I
couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all
the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the
   
   Eleanor
Roosevelt
   
  because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine
and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat—don't you know that
every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?
Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?"
  
 
  "Yes," she said bitterly. "You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you.
I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him
equally guilty?"
  
 
  "No, Sis, he didn't," I was beginning to argue. "All he wanted—"
  
 
  "Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be
sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences."
  
 
  "Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?"
  
 
  He waved his hands at her impatiently. "I'm not talking law, female;
I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to
look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your
way to Venus for a husband. So let's."
  
 
  Sis actually staggered back. "Let's? Let's
   
   what
   
  ? Are—are you daring
to suggest that—that—"
  
 
  "Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you
know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing
on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you
know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific
stock, too."
  
 
  I was so excited I just had to yell: "Gee, Sis, say
   
   yes
   
  !"
