Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had
been imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work
on.
  
 
  The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that
opened into the corridor.
  
 
  After intensive searching, we realized there was
   
   no way
   
  to damage the
ship or reach any section other than our allotted space.
  
 
  We gave up.
  
 
  The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to
the "kitchen."
  
 
  At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and
discussed our predicament.
  
 
  "Trapped," Kane said angrily. "Trapped in a steel prison." He slammed
his fist against the table top. "But there must be a way to get out!
Every problem has a solution!"
  
 
  "You sure?" I asked.
  
 
  "What?"
  
 
  "
   
   Does
   
  every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some
problems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our
civilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.
Primarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A
murderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an
entire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours
is now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned
few criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds
to lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I
don't think we have a chance."
  
 
  My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's
wife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that
few people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.
