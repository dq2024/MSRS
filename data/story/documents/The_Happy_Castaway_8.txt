Jonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, "Do any of you know how to
grow tobacco?"
  
 
  They glanced at each other in perplexity.
  
 
  "I like it here," continued Jonathan. "I'm not going back."
  
 
  "What?" cried the three explorers in one breath.
  
 
  "I'm going to stay," he repeated. "I only came back here after the
cigarettes."
  
 
  "But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back
in the space lanes," said Doctor Boynton. "You don't possibly expect to
be picked up before then!"
  
 
  Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco
seed, and cigarettes.
  
 
  "Odd." Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. "Though if
I remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during
the medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the
wilderness to escape the temptation of
   
   women
   
  ."
  
 
  Jonathan laughed outright.
  
 
  "You are sure you won't return, young man?"
  
 
  He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant.
He said, "You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stop
one of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swings
back in the space ways. I'll have a load for them."
  
 
  Inside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent port
hole. "What a strange fellow," he murmured. He was just in time to see
the castaway, loaded like a pack mule, disappear in the direction from
which he had come.
  
 
  Robinson Crusoe was going back to his man (?) Fridayâ€”all twenty-seven
of them.
