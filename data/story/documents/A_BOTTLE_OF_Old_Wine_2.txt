  Herbert Hyrel
  settled himself
more comfortably in his
easy chair, extended his short legs
further toward the fireplace, and let
his eyes travel cautiously in the general
direction of his wife.
  
 
  She was in her chair as usual, her
long legs curled up beneath her,
the upper half of her face hidden
in the bulk of her personalized,
three-dimensional telovis. The telovis,
of a stereoscopic nature, seemingly
brought the performers with
all their tinsel and color directly
into the room of the watcher.
  
 
  Hyrel had no way of seeing into
the plastic affair she wore, but he
guessed from the expression on the
lower half of her face that she was
watching one of the newer black-market
sex-operas. In any event,
there would be no sound, movement,
or sign of life from her for
the next three hours. To break the
thread of the play for even a moment
would ruin all the previous
emotional build-up.
  
 
  There had been a time when he
hated her for those long and silent
evenings, lonely hours during
which he was completely ignored.
It was different now, however, for
those hours furnished him with
time for an escape of his own.
  
 
  His lips curled into a tight smile
and his right hand fondled the unobtrusive
switch beneath his trouser
leg. He did not press the switch.
He would wait a few minutes
longer. But it was comforting to
know that it was there, exhilarating
to know that he could escape
for a few hours by a mere flick of
his finger.
  
 
  He let his eyes stray to the dim
light of the artificial flames in the
fireplace. His hate for her was not
bounded merely by those lonely
hours she had forced upon him.
No, it was far more encompassing.
  
 
  He hated her with a deep, burning
savagery that was deadly in its
passion. He hated her for her
money, the money she kept securely
from him. He hated her for the
paltry allowance she doled out to
him, as if he were an irresponsible
child. It was as if she were constantly
reminding him in every
glance and gesture, "I made a bad
bargain when I married you. You
wanted me, my money, everything,
and had nothing to give in return
except your own doltish self. You
set a trap for me, baited with lies
and a false front. Now you are
caught in your own trap and will
remain there like a mouse to eat
from my hand whatever crumbs I
stoop to give you."
  
 
  But some day his hate would be
appeased. Yes, some day soon he
would kill her!
  
 
  He shot a sideways glance at her,
wondering if by chance she suspected.... She
hadn't moved. Her
lips were pouted into a half smile;
the sex-opera had probably
reached one of its more pleasurable
moments.
  
 
  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to
the fireplace again. Yes, he would
kill her. Then he would claim
a rightful share of her money, be
rid of her debasing dominance.
