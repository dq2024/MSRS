            "Second Secretary Magnan will be away from the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE) for two weeks, leaving Retief in charge. Magnan reminds Retief that his role is to act as a rubber stamp, continuing Magnan\u2019s actions. Magnan points out that Retief should appreciate that Bogan is participating in the Exchange Program. Its participation might be a step toward sublimating their aggression into more cultivated channels. The Bogans are sending two thousand students to d\u2019Land as exchange students, and Magnan thinks this might end their aggression and bring them into the cultural life of the Galaxy. Retief wonders aloud what the students will study in such a poor, industrial land. Magnan points out that this is none of Retief\u2019s concern and that his role is simply to facilitate bringing the two groups together. When Miss Furkle, the secretary, buzzes Magnan that the bucolic person from Lovenbroy is there again, Magnan pushes the meeting off onto Retief.\n\nThe person from Lovenbroy is named Hank Arapoulous. He is a farmer and tells Retief that the Bacchus vines that they use to make their wine mature every twelve years and that this year is a harvest year, but they are short on workers to harvest the grapes. They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it. Also, Lovenbroy had to borrow money from Croanie, and the loan was due. The wine crop will put them in the clear if they can harvest it. The biggest concern is what Croanie will do with the land if they can\u2019t pay the loan; Lovenbroy has offered half its grape acreage as security for the loan it received. Hank asks Retief for a loan, but Retief tells him that MEDDLE\u2019s role is only for transportation. Hank says he also checked with the Labor Office, but it only offered to set them up with machinery. \n\nRetief attends a council meeting and learns that Croanie will receive a shipment of strip mining equipment. A spokesman for the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) indicates he has been trying to get mining equipment for d\u2019Land. He tells Retief that Boge is a troublemaker, so all the agencies in the Corps are trying to appease her. Upon further discussion, Retief learns that d\u2019Land doesn\u2019t have a university for the exchange students to attend, just a technical college that would be overwhelmed to receive 200, much less 2,000, students. \n\nRetief also learns that all the exchange students are males, and their \u201cluggage\u201d is full of weapons. He diverts their luggage and sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy, where they help harvest the grapes. Retief is also sent to Lovenbroy for exceeding his authority. Hank tells Retief that he has won the prize for the picking competition. The prize is a girl named Delinda.\n\n",
            "Retief is left in charge of his division while his superior, Magnan, is out of the office. After a farmer from the planet Lovenbroy tries to enlist his help with a labor shortage, Retief realizes a complex plot has been set into motion by the government of the planet Boge. The Bogans are sending two-thousand students to the planet D\u2019Land, except there\u2019s no school to accommodate them there and they\u2019re not actually students but soldiers. They\u2019ve also arranged to have weapons and war vehicles shipped under the guise of student baggage and tractors. Boge is using the financial leverage they have with the planet Croanie to get them to help with these shipments, and to ultimately allow the Bogans to take over Lovenbroy (a planet in debt to Lovenbroy that Boge has tried and failed to conquer in the past), D\u2019Land, and potentially another planet. After Retief uncovers how all of these plans and planets are connected, he moves to disrupt them. He reroutes the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy to help with their grape harvest and allow them to get out of their debt to Croanie, and the war machines to D\u2019Land where they\u2019ll be out of Bogan hands. The end of the story finds Retief on Lovenbroy, where he has been sent because his superiors aren\u2019t happy that he meddled with the Bogan situation. Retief doesn\u2019t seem to mind his exile to Lovenbroy at all, as he has just won the grape harvest competition and met the beautiful woman who claims to be his prize. \n",
            "\tAfter Second Secretary Magnan took his temporary leave of the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (AKA MUDDLE), Retief, his subordinate, is put in charge. Retief\u2019s first order of business is dealing with Hank Arapoulous who came to MUDDLE to ask for some help harvesting the Bacchus grapes. He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie\u2019s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can\u2019t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous\u2019 home planet. \n\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there\u2019s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d\u2019Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d\u2019Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students. As well, Boge and d\u2019Land have a very tense relationship; such a trade would be very rare. Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \n\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down. He simply wants to know when their luggage, flying in on a Croanie ship, will get in and when they will leave. \n\tQuickly, their plot falls apart as Retief researches these tractors and discovers they are machines built for war. After interrogating Mr. Whaffle about the shipment, he discovers that the tractors are going to Lovenbroy. He speaks to Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative, who reveals that he just submitted an application for transportation for another 2,000 students. Retief then discovers the student\u2019s luggage was bound for Lovenbroy and filled with army-grade weaponry. Putting it all together, Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy without their weapons, hands Mr. Karsh off to Arapoulous for a frank talking to, and sends the tractors to d\u2019Land. The plan now thwarted, the students help harvest the Bacchus grapes. \n\tRetief was sent to Lovenbroy as punishment. He joins the harvest and ends up picking the most grapes of them all. His prize is a beautiful blonde woman. \n",
            "Corps HQ is a diplomatic entity that houses a number of intergalactic departments, including the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education (MUDDLE), which employs the story\u2019s protagonist, Retief. Retief reports to Second Secretary Magnan, who is taking some time off and asks Retief to manage affairs in his absence. He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d\u2019Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan\u2019s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy\u2019s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won\u2019t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d\u2019Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d\u2019Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d\u2019Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students\u2019 luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the \u201cstudents\u201d to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop. Later, on Lovenbroy, Retief wins the grape-picking competition and celebrates with a local woman named Delinda, his prize for winning."

            "The Bogans are people who have a history of aggression within the Nicodemean Cluster. In the last twenty years, they have launched four military campaigns against other Galaxy members; because of this, they are known as the Hoodlums of the Nicodemean Cluster. They have agreed to send 2,000 of their students to participate in the Exchange Program in d\u2019Land that the Manpower Utilization Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education is facilitating. This agreement is a curiosity to Retief because d\u2019Land is a poor, industrial society, so he wonders what the Bogans will study there. His superior, Second Secretary Magnan, tells him that is none of his business and to be sure not to antagonize the Bogan representative. According to the Special Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Underdeveloped Nations\u2019 General Economies (SCROUNGE) committeeman, every agency in the Corps is trying to appease Boge since Boge is a well-known troublemaker. He also informs Retief that d\u2019Land has no universities, just an under-endowed technical college that could not handle 200, much less 2,000, exchange students. He also tells Retief that most of d\u2019Land\u2019s problems result from an unwise trade agreement that it made with Boge.\n\n Retief meets Karsh, a Scoutmaster who trained the Bogan students; he made it like a game but says they know how to handle a CSU. As the Bogan students come through Customs and see Mr. Karsh, they snap to attention. Mr. Karsh refuses to let the students leave the airport. Retief notices that all the exchange students are males, and Karsh tells him they wanted to see how the first group of students was received before sending any females. Retief realizes that Bogan students are headed to a place that has no classrooms for the students. In the meantime, the tractors are being sent to Croanie, a world under obligation to Boge, and Croanie holds the mortgage to the best vineyards in Lovenbroy. Retief looks up the tractors that are being sent to Croanie and discovers they are armored vehicles with a half-megaton per second firepower. Retief learns that these continental siege units are ultimately being sent to Lovenbroy, which is rich in minerals, on behalf of Boge. Retief also learns that Boge has an application to send another 2,000 students to Croanie and is considering sending 2,000 more to Featherweight. Retief learns that Boge tried to take over Lovenbroy several years earlier and would have succeeded if not for bad luck. Retief calls a friend who works in transport and learns that the Bogan students\u2019 luggage is all being sent to Lovenbroy, and when he looked in the luggage, it was all weapons. Retief diverts the luggage and sends the students on to Lovenbroy to help with the grape harvest for the vineyards. He impounds the luggage full of weapons.\n\n",
            "The Bogans are the people from the planet Boge. According to Retief\u2019s superior, they are known as the \u201choodlums\u201d of the nearby universe and have launched multiple military campaigns in the recent past. Despite this, no one seems to suspect the Bogans when they claim to be participating in a \u201ccultural exchange\u201d.  They plan to send \u201cstudents\u201d who are really intended to be soldiers and guns to D\u2019Land, a planet that loves peace but isn\u2019t on good terms with Boge. Another planet, Croanie, has fallen into debt to Boge and is facilitating a transshipment of \u201ctractors\u201d that are actually devices only useful for war or mining, making it seem like they might also be looking to take over Lovenbroy (which they tried, unsuccessfully, to do in the past, as well as another small nearby planet referenced in the story, Featherweight. Their plans are thwarted by Retief when he figures out what they are up to and reroutes the weaponry to D\u2019Land and the students to Lovenbroy. \n",
            "\tThe Bogans are the people of Boge, a planet that lies in the same cluster as Lovenbroy and Croanie. The Bogans attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years back, and, though they managed to fight for one year, they were eventually defeated. Their goal was to mine the land for the rich minerals that lay below the surface. \n\tAfter scheming with Croanie (who loaned money and resources to Lovenbroy post-war), the Bogans were able to develop a plan to finally invade Lovenbroy successfully. By using grants and a ploy of educating 2,000 of their students, the Bogans were almost able to ship 2,000 male soldiers to Lovenbroy with an array of weaponry in their duffel bags. The Bogans lied and said that they were sending these \u201cstudents\u201d to d\u2019Land to study there at the university. As well, Croanie aided them in acquiring 500 death tractors. These Bolo WV M-1s are incredibly dangerous tanks that can travel extremely fast and are outfitted with a bulldozer blade. Thanks to this added blade, they were able to market them as simply tractors, not the weapons of war they truly are. The tractors were on their way to Lovenbroy when Retief caught wind of their plan and stopped their shipment. He sent them to d\u2019Land instead, an enemy of the Bogans. \n\tRetief further destroyed their plan by sending the trained boys to Lovenbroy without their weaponry. He sent them to this beautiful planet so they could help Arapoulous in harvesting the Bacchus grapes. Fully thwarted and upset, Mr. Gulver, the Bogan representative, admits defeat and somehow escapes any true diplomatic punishment. \n",
            "The Bogans are a warring people from the planet Boge who have started four wars in the past twenty years throughout the galaxy. Because of their warlike tendencies, the Corps bends over backward to work with them to restore diplomacy to the galaxy. Boge has a trade agreement with the small, underpopulated planet of d\u2019Land, which they use to their advantage in hatching their plan to overtake them. They also have a hold over the planet of Croanie, which controls the vineyard mortgages on the planet of Lovenbroy. The Bogan representative, Mr. Gulver, manipulates the incompetent functions of the Corps to procure grants for 500 armored tractors to be sent to Croanie, which cannot process that amount. The plan is to send the excess to Boge. In addition, he has worked out an agreement with Second Secretary Magnan to send 2,000 students to d\u2019Land\u2019s technical college, which cannot accommodate that many students. Retief discovers that the students\u2019 luggage contains guns, and so he puts all the pieces together and discovers the Bogans\u2019 plan to overtake d\u2019Land rather than sublimate themselves. Retief sends the students to Lovenbroy to help harvest the grapes, and the guns are confiscated by representatives from the Armaments department."

They grow Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. This year is a harvest year, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. Arapoulousis explains to Retief that a few years ago, Boge landed a force on Lovenbroy to try to mine their minerals by strip-mining. Lovenbroy fought back for a year but lost a lot of its men. This created financial problems, so Lovenbroy borrowed money from Croanie, mortgaging its crops. The loan is due, and the wine crop will cover the loan amount, but they don\u2019t have enough people to harvest the grapes. He is worried that if they don\u2019t have a great harvest, Croanie will come in and start mining. Also, if they default on the loan, Croanie will hold half of the grape acreage that they used to secure the loan. Arapoulousis has also asked for help from the Labor Office, but they only offered to send them machinery, and machines cannot harvest the grapes. He returns to see Retief the following day to find out if Retief has discovered a way to help. When Mr. Karsh makes a scene about the missing luggage for the exchange students, Retief has Arapoulousis take Karsh away and \u201ctake care of him.\u201d When they return, Karsh is stumbling and needs support to stand up. Arapoulousis explains that Karsh fell. \nRetief sends the exchange students to Lovenbroy with Arapoulousis to help with the harvest. As the harvest is winding down, Arapoulousis tells Retief that Retief has won the award for the picking competition. Arapoulousis is also the person who judges the wine contest.\n",

He is described as tall and broad with gray hair and tanned skin, and he says he is 28 in Lovenbroy years, or 42 in terrestrial years. He is friendly, honest, and informal, though he is worried throughout most of the story about his people and his planet. He asks Retief for help getting labor to assist with Lovenbroy\u2019s grape harvest so they don\u2019t default on their debt to another planet, Croanie. He also informs Retief about Lovenbroy\u2019s relationships and history with other planets, which helps Retief put the pieces together regarding what the Bogans are trying to do.

Although he hybridizes fruit as well for his job (apples the size of melons!), his love for his home planet comes first. He is a very stocky and sturdy man, around Retief\u2019s height. He is middle-aged, in his early 40s in Terrestrial years but only 28 in Lovenbroy years. He\u2019s a silver fox with gray hair and tan skin. \n\tArapoulous arrives at MUDDLE in need of help and assistance. The Bacchus wine, which he cultivates, has two varieties, red and black. The crop is only harvested every 12 years, but this year they have a shortage of harvesters. He asks Retief to send over some pickers since the other departments had already turned him down. \n\tArapoulous plays a very important role in this story as he introduces Retief to the diplomatic relations between Lovenbroy, Croanie, and the Borge. After explaining that the Lovenbroy are in debt to the Croanie (who came to their aid after a one-year war with the Boge), Retief soon realizes that a great plot is at hand. When all is discovered and Retief manages to thwart the Borge takeover of Lovenbroy, Arapoulous helps him interrogate and punish Karsh, the militaristic leader of the Borge boys. \n\tVictorious and proud, Arapoulous returns to Lovenbroy with 2,000 mighty helping hands. The Borge boys who were trained to take over Lovenbroy are now being used to harvest its mighty crop. Arapoulous is thrilled at the turn of events, especially since only hoped for 100 men, and is even more excited when he learns that Retief might be staying on Lovenbroy for a while. With his home safe from prying eyes and greedy hands, Arapoulous ends the story on a high note. \n",

Without the labor, they will not be able to pay back their debt to Croanie, the planet that owns the mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s vineyards. Hank tells Retief he is 28 years old, but later he learns Hank is closer to 42 because of the variation in the Terry years they use to track time on his planet. Hank is gregarious and passionate about the wine they produce, and he shares the red and black variations with Retief, who enjoys both. Retief agrees to help Hank, and during his inquiries, he discovers the Bogan plot to incite military action against d\u2019Land.

Lovenbroy is known for its exquisite wines produced from the Bacchus vines, which only mature once every twelve years. Lovenbroy is important for the Galaxy culture because, during the time when it is not raising and harvesting grapes and other crops, it makes important cultural contributions. They have created parks and farms and left sizable forests for hunting. They offer skiing, bob-sledding, and ice skating in the spring while it is still cold. They also create fine furniture, sculpture, and art. During the summer, they offer beach parties, drama, and symphonies. The land is full of minerals, which led Boge to land a force to strip-mine some of the resources. Lovenbroy fought back, but it took a year, and it lost many men. This has left Lovenbroy short-handed for this year\u2019s grape harvest. It also took a financial toll on Lovenbroy, and it had to borrow money from Croanie, mortgage its crops, and export its artwork. The loan is due during the harvest year, and without enough men to pick the grapes, Croanie will come in and take over half the vineyard land and mine it. Croanie is under obligation to Boge, and Boge is behind the scheme of sending \u201cexchange students\u201d supposedly to d\u2019Land but really to Lovenbroy to take its minerals. ",
            "Lovenbroy is a small planet that depends on its grape crop and winemaking to sustain its economy. It is important to the story because a man from Lovenbroy asks Retief for help getting labor to harvest their grapes so they can pay their debts to Croanie. This interaction leads Retief to further investigate a series of events that has been set into motion wherein soldiers, weapons, and drilling equipment are being transported in disguise. In trying to right the wrongs that he discovers, Retief is also able to send two-thousand men to help with the harvest. Lovenbroy is also significant because it is where Retief is sent as punishment for his actions, though he doesn\u2019t seem to mind being stationed on the agreeable planet. \n",
            "Lovenbroy is a beautiful, lush, and rich planet mostly made up of islands. It is the only place where Bacchus grapes can be grown, and its resources are highly coveted. Lovenbroy has five seasons throughout one Lovenbroy year (which is six months longer than a Terrestrial year). Their winters are long and harsh, with little to no sunlight all day long. This forced indoor time led to a very artistic culture springing up. Many spend the winters painting and sculpting. This necessary indoor time has made the Lovenbroy very keen on architecture. Spring is also pretty cold, but warm and light enough to woodwork and play a few sports. Then comes the season of music, where it rains all day but the sun constantly shines. The summer is incredibly hot, which forces people indoors again during the day, but able to play come the evening! Then it\u2019s autumn, which is harvest time for all crops, including the Bacchus grapes every 12 years. \n\tLovenbroy has many rich resources, most likely thanks to its mostly untouched landscape and erratic seasons. The land is ingrained with many minerals that have, so far, remained un-mined. Thanks to these minerals and metals in the soil, the trees (and then harvested timber) that are produced are colored differently. \n\tLovenbroy, being the home of so many invaluable resources, is fought for. A decade before the story began, Lovenbroy was invaded by the Boge who wanted to mine for minerals. After one year of war, the Lovenbroy managed to defeat the Boge, but it left them with a crippled economy and a depleted workforce. Croanie stepped in to help and gave them several loans. However, 10 years later, Lovenbroy is still in debt to Croanie. Harvesting the Bacchus grapes will give them enough revenue to pay off their loans, but they need more harvesters. \n\tLovenbroy is the main source of conflict in this story. Croanie and Boge work together to try and take over Lovenbroy and deplete the land of its resources. \n",
            "Lovenbroy is a planet known for its vast vineyards of Bacchus vines used to produce delicious red and black wines. The vineyards cover mountains, stretch along riversides, and snake through beautiful gardens. Fertile grass springs up throughout the vineyards, and every twelve years, the entire population comes together to celebrate the crop and harvest the fruit together. Lovenbroy also has a rich source of minerals use to enrich their wine, and a few years ago one of their neighbors came to fight for control of these minerals. Lovenbroy ultimately won the battle, but they lost a lot of money and men in the fight, and they had to turn to the planet Croanie for financial assistance. Ultimately, they sold control of the mortgage on their vineyards to Croanie as well, thinking the twelve-year gap between harvests would be enough time to repay the debt. They were wrong, and they send a representative\u2014Hank Arapoulous\u2014to Corps HQ to seek additional labor to help pick the new harvest in time. This visit to Retief\u2019s office kickstarts the chain of events that lead to Retief\u2019s discovery of the Bogan plan to take military action against d\u2019Land."

            "Croanie is a member of the Nicodemean Cluster of the Galaxy and is an associate of Boge, a member known to be a troublemaker. They tried to steal minerals from Lovenbroy earlier by attacking them. Croanie is under obligation to Boge. Croanie is the world that gave Lovenbroy a loan when it needed money to help tide it over until its next grape harvest. Croanie gave Lovenbroy a mortgage on its crops and holds a security interest in half of the grape acreage that it will acquire if Lovenbroy cannot meet the loan payment that is coming due. This is the reason that Hank Arapoulous goes to MEDDLE and asks for help obtaining workers to go to Lovenbroy and harvest the crop. It also turns out that Croanie is involved in Boge\u2019s efforts to attack Lovenbroy and gain access to its minerals. Mr. Whaffle reveals to Retief that Croanie is set to receive a shipment of heavy mining equipment, but Croanie is best known for its oceans and fishing and has no ore. In addition, when the Bogan exchange students arrive without their luggage, Mr. Karsh says their luggage is coming from Croanie. When their luggage does arrive, it is full of weapons. The \u201ctractors\u201d that are being shipped to Croanie are really armored vehicles that are continental siege units that carry four men and have a half-megaton/second firepower. Mr. Whaffle reveals that the tractors are for transshipment and that Croanie is in a difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise, with Boge. There is also an application for 2,000 more \u201cexchange students\u201d to be sent to Croanie.\n",
            "Croanie is a planet that consists mostly of fisheries and is known for their seafood. They loaned another planet, Lovenbroy, some money when they were struggling, and the people of Croanie have also found themselves in debt to Boge, a nearby planet known as a local bully. Because of this, Croanie finds itself deeply entwined in Boge\u2019s web of interplanetary plots by transshipping siege units and/or mining equipment and letting Boge take advantage of their mortgage on Lovenbroy\u2019s best land. \n",
            "Croanie is another planet that neighbors Lovenbroy and Boge. It is the home of many fisheries and seamen. Croanie has developed an alliance with the Bogans, who attempted to invade Lovenbroy ten years ago. When they failed, the Croanie swooped in and offered loans and assistance to the depleted and wounded Lovenbroy. \n\tLater on down the line, Croanie and the Bogans hatched a plot to take over Lovenbroy and mine their resources. The Croanie use grants and diplomatic immunity to acquire 500 Bolos, model WV M-1. These are essentially outfitted superpowered tanks that have a bulldozer blade attached (hence the ability to label them as tractors) to make demolition easier. Once Croanie acquired the \u201ctractors,\u201d Boge would send over 4,000 young Bogan boys to Lovenbroy who were trained and ready to invade. Together, their siege would completely overwhelm the Lovenbroy and destroy their home. \nThanks to Arapoulous coming to MUDDLE for help, Retief was able to piece together the random bits of the puzzle and thwart their plan. \n",
            "Croanie is a mostly-aquatic planet known for its exports of seafood. They provide foot-long prawn to Lovenbroy.

A Croanie ship brings the luggage bearing the Bogans\u2019 weapons to meet the group of Bogan students who are set to fly to d\u2019Land to attend the Exchange Program. The students are actually soldiers, who will supposedly use the weapons to overtake d\u2019Land. They also are the recipients of a grant from the MEDDLE program that will supply them with 500 tractors\u2014an amount they cannot process with the facilities they have on their planet.

They are distraught over their son\u2019s attitude and attribute it to his age and the buildup of repressed impulses. Wayne views is parents with contempt. He reveals that he has been called to be drafted and leaves them to go to the authorities taking the family automobile.\n\nArriving at the Youth Center, Wayne navigates the bureaucracy of being drafted which involves registering and being issued with a firearm and a switchblade. He bristles against the military authority figures at the youth center, deriding their appearance and position. Wayne is cocky and confident even as he is warned about the dangers of his mission. Wayne is assigned a mission that involves killing a known murderer and his girl. He has six hours of autonomy where he is privileged to operate outside of the normal rule of law.\n\nWayne makes his way to a rougher neighborhood and witnesses another teenager hunt down and brutally murder a vagrant with a baseball bat. Wayne enters the bar which contains his target. He locates and engages them, shooting the man and chasing the woman out of the bar into a crumbling apartment building. When he eventually corners her, she begs him to kill her quickly. Wayne however is overcome with a physical aversion to the violence he was intending to commit.\n\nWayne is later being evaluated back at the Youth Center. It is revealed that society engages teenagers to execute criminals as a preferred outlet for their aggressive impulses. Those that go through with an execution are initiated into the military. Wayne mournfully contemplates that \u201cpunking out\u201d in failing to execute his targets relegates him to a shameful, nondescript life much like that of his own father.",
            "Wayne Seton is a young man with an irrepressible urge. At 16 years old, he\u2019s impatient, hormonal, and waiting for the draft, especially not that school is over. His mothers worries over him, but his father assures her that the draft is the right move. \nSeton receives his draft and quickly runs downstairs, grabs the keys to the car, and leaves, ignoring the fear in his father\u2019s eyes. \nHe arrives at the 947th Youth Center. After checking in at the reception, he makes his way to the armory. He picks out a revolver, a shoulder hoster, and a switchblade disguised as a comb. His arrogance shows through his interactions with the many adults working at the Youth Center. They warn him of the trails he\u2019ll face, and he simply laughs them off. \nFinally, he heads to the elevator that will take him to Captain Jack, the commander of this facility. Seton\u2019s nervousness finally shows in his clammy palms and racing thoughts. Captain Jack intimidates him and questions his nerve and willingness to complete the mission. Captain Jack raises his bear-shaped cane to Seton, a blade sticking out the end of it. He tells Seton he has only six hours before the curfew sets back in. His target is at the Four Aces Club; a pretty woman with brightly colored clothes as well as a larger man, who\u2019d killed five people. \nSeton begins his hunt, driving around town and searching for them. He\u2019s pulled over by a cop trying to enforce the curfew, but one look at his pass card sends shivers down the officer\u2019s spine, and Seton is sent on his way. \nOnce he\u2019s arrived at the club, a bum grabs onto him and asks Seton to protect him. A car rushes in, and a young man jumps out. He beats the bum with a baseball bat, then runs him over with his car. Seton watches in awe. \nFinally, he walks into the bar and stalks his prey. After the man put his hands on the girl, he pulled out his revolver and shot him. The girl escapes and he runs after her. \nShe leads him on an epic chase, eventually stopping at what is assumedly her home.\nShe begs him to shoot her first and then beat her once she\u2019s dead. Seton talks and talks, but his confidence fades. He realizes he feels bad for this girl and runs out, leaving her alive. \nSeton is examined by Doctor Burns back at the Youth Center, who questions him about his inability to complete the mission. He reveals that this system was set in place to rid the world of dangerous criminals and to expel the murderous impulses all people are born with. Since Seton failed, two men came in to take him away and treat him. He realizes that the others were like him; they had also refused to kill and had been given the same treatment.\n",
            "Wayne is a teenage boy who lives with his parents, but doesn\u2019t respect them very much. Because he is 16, he is waiting for a draft call. His parents are worried about him, and suspect he has repressed some impulses to be violent, so they are a mix of relieved and concerned when Wayne tells them that he has received his call. Wayne takes the car that his parents were going to take for their night out, and heads toward the neon lights on the freeway. When he arrives at the Public Youth Center to check in for his draft call, he acts arrogantly to the sergeant at the reception desk. He heads to the armory to pick up two weapons: a Smith & Wesson .38, and a six-inch, spring-loaded Skelly switchblade. Afterwards, he heads to Captain Jack\u2019s office. Captain Jack is the first person Wayne encounters in the story who makes him nervous. The Captain gives Wayne permission to go without curfew or law for six hours, and assigns him a task: a \u201cbeast\u201d of a woman on the west side of town, at Four Aces Club, along with the man she is with. Wayne uses his signed pass to get past copy on his way there, driving through darker and darker streets, and  eventually makes it to the club. He ran into a drunk man who tried to ask Wayne for help, but some other teenagers pulled up a car, beat the man to death with a baseball bat, and split. Wayne disappeared into the club and caught eye of his targets. He was able to match the woman\u2019s description to the outfit Captain Jack said she would be wearing, and Wayne sits at a nearby table, watching the woman get nervous. He orders a drink; after he downs it, he gets up, and his targets try to run. He shoots the man before they all run out of the club, chasing each other through alleys and a building that was falling apart. He eventually cornered the woman in a pieced-together bedroom, and she begged him to kill her quickly. She is so tired of running from people sent to kill her that she would like it to be over as quickly as possible. Wayne pulls out his belt to whip her with, but after he swings it once, he starts to retreat. The woman still begs for him to kill her, but his attitude has completely shifted and he insists that he cannot, and runs away. When Wayne goes back to the Youth Center, the doctor in charge of \u201creadjustment\u201d of teenagers scolds Wayne for not killing the woman, both because he believes the two targeted people are terrible people, but also because that means Wayne did not get the violent energy out of his system. The team is sent to receive treatment and be sent back home, and Wayne realizes that these nights end like this more often than he had realized. ",
            "Wayne listens at the top of the stairs as his parents discuss their concerns about him. Eva, his mother, worries that Wayne doesn\u2019t eat, and his father explains that he\u2019s only sixteen years old and he\u2019s waiting on his draft card. His father reminds Eva that Wayne\u2019s repressed impulses are not something they should be worrying about because the Youth Board takes care of those.\n\nWayne tells his parents that he just got his draft call, and he demands the car keys and leaves the house. He travels to the Youth Center. When he arrives, he chooses a gun and a knife for his weapons, and he meets up with Captain Jack. Captain Jack tells Wayne that he has one chance to prove himself, and he has six hours to complete his mission. Wayne needs to go to the Four Aces Club and murder two people who top the undesireable list. \n\nOutside of the club, he watches as a homeless person is beaten to death by a teenager. The bum calls out for help, but Wayne ignores his pleas.\n\nOnce he goes inside, he immediately recognizes his two targets, Red the psycho and a mousy girl. His gun fires accidentally, and the girl runs outside. Wayne chases her through dilapidated buildings and into her home where he sees the disgusting nest she sleeps in. Although he knows he is on a mission to bruise her and then kill her, and he has been asked to fulfill this duty, he cannot do it. He feels too badly for her. Even when she begs to be murdered so that she no longer has to live in fear of death, he refuses.\n\nWayne goes back to the Youth Center where Doctor Burns, the head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center, tells him that he needed to get his impulses out of the way in a controlled environment. Now, he can\u2019t be trusted not to hurt someone else since everyone has those impulses inside of themselves. Wayne is sent for treatment, and he realizes he is just like his father whom he despises. \n"

The inner-city area is known as Slumville and is filled with crumbling infrastructure and violent dealings. It is described as dark and mazelike with semi-abandoned buildings that are on the verge of collapse. The Four Aces Club where the main conflict of the story takes place is a seedy bar in Slumville where undesirables congregate.

A curfew is set in place, keeping in the acceptable people and allowing the undesirables to be hunted. As the main character continues to explore the city, we see more and more of its darkness.

After some more driving into town, Wayne heads into darker and darker streets that twist their way towards the club he was told his targets would be at. He parked his car in the alley across from the club, next to a large collection of garbage cans, where he encountered a homeless man. When he made it into the club, he found it to be very hazy and dark, even though it had been night outside already. He sat at his own table in the smoky environment for a while, until it was time to chase his targets. Once outside, the alley turned into a maze of other alleys, parking lots, ruined buildings, and other infrastructure that seems to be falling apart. He followed her up a crumbling staircase in a building that was barely standing, and eventually cornered her in a small room where she had made a makeshift bed to sleep on, created entirely from scraps of anything she could find, including paper and rags.

            "Distinctive teenage or \u201cteener\u201d vernacular language is used extensively throughout the story. Wayne uses slang to communicate his dismissiveness of those in authority. People who live commonplace lives are \u201csquareheads\u201d and \u201cpunks\u201d. Some typical proper nouns are shortened \u201cOlds\u201d for Oldsmobile, \u201cCad\u201d for Cadillac. The effect is to cement the story in a future where language has evolved from its current state with teens communicating in a way that distinguishes them from other more conventional member of society. Wayne\u2019s interaction with the waiter is emblematic of this effect. By saying, \u201cBring me a Crusher,\u201d and then \u201cFade,\u201d it is signaled to the reader that Wayne views himself as a member of a select group with its own cant.",
            "The author uses slang throughout the story as a way to designate actions/events that are unfamiliar and to fully immerse the reader. Although no clear definitions are given, the true meaning of the slang is discovered as the story unfolds. At first, the draft and make out are absolutely foreign terms. As the story continues, the reader learns that to make out is to take on the mission assigned to the youth by the Public Youth Center. These terms thrust the reader into the story and show how different this world is from ours.",
            "Slang is the means by which the author denotes various categories of people throughout the story. In this world, people are categorized in large age groups. Wayne refers to people his parents\u2019 age as the Olds, and Wayne himself is referred to multiple times as a teener. This use of slang separates the world in the story from the world of the reader. It seems that Wayne likes to refer to things in casual ways, referring to the family car as a bolt bucket, and really takes the label of punk to heart when he is called that by Captain Jack. When Wayne arrives at the club where his targets are, the car that the other teenagers show up in is referred to as a Cad, presumably short for Cadillac. Another way language is used to delineate groups of people is in calling the hunted people beasts, and using animal imagery to describe them. The targets Wayne was after referred to as beasts, the woman as a mouse, and the man is a cat. This is one way these people are portrayed as less than human. Even during the chase, the woman is regularly referred to as a mouse, even as actual rats are running by as well. However, others are not entirely exempt from this use of animal imagery at the point of comparison, as Wayne is also compared to wild deer when he is chasing after the woman in the alley.",
            "Slang words are used throughout the story, not only when Wayne is talking, but also when the narrator is explaining characters\u2019 actions. The specific word choices work to make the setting appear unique and mostly dreadful. \n\nWayne refers to his parents as \u201csquareheads\u201d as an insult. Wayne can\u2019t wait to distinguish himself from his parents. He finds them to be monotonous, overbearing, and lame. The slang term is meant to portray them in the light that Wayne sees them. They are not bad people, and they are deeply for their son. They\u2019re just normal, everyday parents, and Wayne wants a more adventurous life. \n\nIn a later scene, the narrator refers to a homeless person on the street as a \u201cstewbum\u201d. The word is definitely not a euphemism for alcoholic, and it doesn\u2019t make the character appear sympathetic. Instead, the use of the term stewbum suggests that he is inferior and is almost deserving of the violence he faces from a seemingly random teenager. \n\nIn the text, teenagers are referred to as \u201cteeners\u201d. Since teenagers have a very important role in this society, and it\u2019s definitely a rite of passage to fulfill the violent mission and purge the criminal that they\u2019ve been assigned to, this slang term makes teenagers seem like a separate class of people. Their ability or inability to make good on their draft card will change the course of their lives, so it\u2019s fitting that they are given a different name.\n\n"

He felt he could explode at any moment, so being cold and short with them when they had to interact with them is his way of keeping them out of the line of fire of his impulses. He insists on taking the family car, and is still high and mighty when he gets to the Public Youth Center, throwing sass at the sergeant at the reception desk as well as the corporal in the armory. It is only when he meets Captain Jack that he starts to show some humility and nervousness. His hands start to sweat, and the captain calls him a punk a number of times and then startles him, almost whacking Wayne with his cane. Once he gets to the club, Wayne is nervous interacting with the homeless alcoholic who encountering the alley, and is terrified by the other teenagers who arrived to kill this man. After he retreats into the club, Wayne finds a sense of superiority again as he flashes his official documents to be able to order a drink, after he spots his targets. His goal is to make them as uncomfortable as possible, so he sits right near them, and enjoys the opportunity to have a drink on the government\u2019s dime. After he decides to pursue his targets, he shoots the man once before both targets and Wayne make their way outside. Wayne taunts the woman as he chases her through the alley and the dilapidated buildings, and threatens her with what he intends to do to her once he has her cornered. Once he actually strikes her with his belt though, he retreats into himself and is very nervous all of a sudden, and runs away from the woman. He felt sorry for her, and told this to the doctor at the Youth Center as he is scolded. Wayne seems ashamed, apologizes for punking out, and quietly does what he is told by the doctor for the rest of the session.",
            "Wayne looks down on the other characters in the story, including his own mother and father. He refers to them as squareheads, and he actually finds his mother\u2019s distress and her arguments with his father to be funny. In a brief scene where Wayne demands the car keys from his parents, it\u2019s clear that they are fearful of him. Instead of thanking them for allowing him to use the car, he repays them for their generosity by laughing at them and slamming the door in his mother\u2019s face. Wayne is fully aware that his mother is terrified of his draft call, and he does not allow her to hug him or give him words of encouragement or advice before he leaves the house. \n\nWhen he arrives at the Youth Center, he treats the man at the front desk poorly, and then proceeds to make fun of the corporal who tries to give him advice. Wayne has a bad attitude, and it affects his interactions with everyone. \n\nThe only person that Wayne does not feel like he can treat badly is Captain Jack. Captain Jack is in a serious position of authority, and that makes Wayne nervous. He answers his questions politely. \n\nIt is truly shocking when Wayne is unable to kill the mousy woman that he was assigned to purge. He has her cornered in an abandoned and run-down building, but he can\u2019t go through with the violence, no matter how much he wants to. In the meeting that takes place afterwards, he tells the doctor that he felt bad for the woman. Therefore, Wayne does have a conscience, even if he likes to pretend that he does not. \n"

            "The expository dialogue by Doctor Burns at the end of the story provides some insight into how this society views the tendency toward violence in its citizens and retributive criminal justice. The prevailing understanding is that adolescents (presumably adolescent men) are subjected to aggressive and violent impulses. The society seeks to provide these teens a preferred outlet for these impulses in the form of a violent act in service of the state. Typical this seems to be the execution of an undesirable member of society who is viewed as beyond redemption. This permitted brutality is thought to get it out of a teen\u2019s system and prepare him for a life as a contributing member in the state\u2019s military apparatus. The result of this situation is a dramatically violent society where untrained youths are recruited to act as vicious vigilantes who terrorize anyone labelled as undesirable. ",
            " In the final passages of the story, Wayne Seton, the protagonist, sees a doctor after his failed attempt to eliminate two alleged criminals. Despite feeling the spark and need to hunt and kill earlier, when faced with a scared young woman, he was unable to complete his task. \nDoctor Burns, a member of the readjustment staff at the center where Seton was drafted, takes a look over Seton after he returned. Although Seton enjoyed the thrill of the chase, his empathy and sympathy got the better of him. \nAfter examining him, Dr. Burns reveals the reason why Seton was sent on this mission in the first place. In this abstract reality, those who have committed heinous crimes (in this case, paternal murder and multiple homicides) are labeled as unwanted and unable to change. Instead of sending them to prison for their crimes where they may spend the rest of their lives or receive the death penalty, they send young adults out to hunt them down. \nAt 16 years old, school ends for the teenagers in this society. Once school is over, all the young adults must wait for their draft to come in. \nThey believe that each person is born with a dangerous impulse to kill. If it can be expelled at a young age and used on a person who deserves it, then there\u2019s no risk of a violent crime later on. \nThe justice system is executed by everyday people, instead of a team of soldiers or the government. \nAs well, if the 16-year-olds complete their mission, they will be shot off to space and continue their work in the galaxy.\n",
            "In this society, instead of imposing penalties like death row, the government uses teenagers to end the lives of the people the society has deemed the biggest criminals. Part of this is an attempt to acknowledge the violent impulses that they expect teenagers to have, so this program is meant to give teenagers an outlet to expend this energy in hopes of getting rid of it entirely. Violent tendencies are clearly expected of everyone, as part of a more primitive instinct of sorts. The two people that Wayne was given as targets both killed people outside of this designated time, and so society decided they had to die. There is this tension between government sanctioned murder and other murder. This opportunity for teenagers to address their aggression also serves as a sort of test, and their ability to successfully eliminate their targets determines their future in some way. Formally, this means that the teenagers are given their own choice of weapons, and a six-hour pass to do whatever they want, including breaking curfew and any other laws. However, what happens to them going forward depends on the success of killing their targets in the six hours.",
            "When the children in this society turn sixteen, they are forced to take a draft call. They must go to a local Youth Center and take orders from an established captain. The kids choose the weapons they would like to use, and they head out to take down a dangerous individual or multiple individuals. When Wayne is stopped by a cop at the beginning of his mission, all he has to do is show the police officer the card he has, and he\u2019s free to continue on into the darkness. This means that his mission is sanctioned by the state. \n\nAfter Wayne fails to commit the beatings and murders that he\u2019s been assigned, he must receive some sort of treatment from a doctor. The thinking is that all people are born with impulses to commit violence, and those that cannot bring themselves to do it in a state sanctioned way are now in danger of hurting people that do not deserve it. The society asks the teenagers to kill the criminals because they believe it fulfills two necessities at once. Dangerous people are expelled from society, and adolescents can be trusted not to turn into violent individuals because they have already gotten it out of their systems.  \n"

Marnagan states that they could walk the entire diameter of the planet they are on in four hours, but Hathaway points out that he has only an hour of oxygen.  Hathaway states that he has photo evidence that the meteor that hit their ship was thrown at them, probably by Gunther, the person Marnagan is trying to capture, but Marnagan redirects their priorities to oxygen, food, and a way back to earth.\n\nAs they walk in search of help, they notice that there is human-made gravity on the planet.  Immediately after making that discovery, they encounter an enormous herd of dangerous beasts.  When Marnagan discovers his gun is ineffective as a weapon, they flee to a nearby cave for protection, as the cave is too small for the beasts to enter.\n\nMarnagan asks Hathaway to take a picture of him with the beasts.  Hathaway snaps several pictures of Marnagan posing at a safe distance.  Hathaway then says that between the \u201cnatural\u201d meteors, gravity, and beasts, their crash will look accidental rather than like murder.  He shows Marnagan the pictures he shot, intending to use the beasts as part of his argument, but Marnagan protests that his film is \u201clousy\u201d as only Marnagan, appears in the shots and not the beasts.  When Hathaway confirms this is so, he is insistent that the film cannot lie.  If the beasts do not appear in the photos, they don\u2019t exist.\n\nWhen they emerge from the cave and the animals are gone, the men are at first elated.  Hathaway quickly realizes, though, that with their oxygen running low and limiting the time they have to find Gunther\u2019s base and fresh oxygen, they must get the beasts to return so that they can follow the beasts to their source--Gunther\u2019s base.\n\nThe men concentrate on the beasts and the beasts reappear; Hathaway and Marnagan locate a source point and head toward it.  Marnagan believes he is being attacked by a beast, but when Hathaway reminds him the monsters are fake, Marnagan is able to resist the telepathic message.  Marnagan enters the cave where it appears the animals are coming from and finds an air-lock door and a tunnel before he is captured by a guard.  He tells the guard his partner is dead.\n\nHathaway creeps in through the air-lock door to see Marnagan held at gunpoint.  Hathaway fools the guard into believing he is armed, takes his gun, and gets the guard to guide him and Marnagan to oxygen.  They then use photos of Marnagan, inserted in the telepath machines, to take over Gunther\u2019s fortress and capture him.  The story ends with Hathaway taking a triumphant posed picture of Marnagan.",
            "Click Hathaway and Irish Marnagan are on patrol, looking for the space pirate Gunther that no one has ever seen before. Marnagan is an Interplanetary Patrolman from Luna Base who hired Hathaway to travel with him and film the pirate's capture. He wants to use the film footage to teach Junior Patrolmen how to get out of difficult situations. While Hathaway is filming, a meteor strikes their spaceship, knocking it down to an asteroid. The ship splits open, so there is no way for them to leave the asteroid. They both have 60 minutes of oxygen remaining. At first, they think the meteor was an accident, but then Hathaway remembers that it was red-hot and glowing before it struck them, and he knows that meteors in space are never glowing hot. Hathaway is convinced that Gunther lobbed the meteor at them to make them crash. As they begin walking on the surface of the meteor, they notice a change in the gravity in one place and realize that they have stumbled upon Gunther\u2019s hideout. Then a horde of monsters comes charging at them, making Hathaway and Marnagan run for their lives and hide in a small cave. Marnagan fires his gun at the beasts, but it does not affect them.\n\nMarnagan has Hathaway film him facing the beasts. Hathaway has invented a film that develops itself when exposed to light. He pulls the film out of his camera for them to view, and both are surprised to find that the monsters are not on it. Hathaway thinks that the monsters are not real since they do not show up on the film. He believes they have just been tricked into thinking they are real. Marnagan agrees and decides to walk out among the monsters. When he does, the monsters disappear. Hathaway says that the monsters are still dangerous because as long as people think they are real, they might be frightened to death or commit suicide to avoid being caught by them. He also concludes that if they believe the monsters are real, they will return. \n\nBoth men say they believe in the monsters to draw them out again so that they can see where they come from. They find the opening to the hideout, and Marnagan goes in first since he has a gun, but a guard catches him. Hathaway hears the guard over the audio system and sneaks up on the guard and threatens him to make him throw down his weapon. Marnagan and Hathaway find the telepathic station from which the images of the monsters are sent. Hathaway feeds his film into the telepathic station. When he confronts Gunther, the telepathic station shows an image of 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen marching toward them, but it\u2019s really just Marnagan and 499 images of him. The guards run away as Hathaway films them. Since the film won\u2019t record the telepathic images, it will look like Marnagan singlehandedly fought off all of Gunther\u2019s guards.\n",
            "Click Hathaway has been hired to document the journey that \u201cIrish\u201d Marnagan has embarked upon to kill Gunther, a space pirate. Their ship is struck by meteors and lands on an asteroid, where they begin to realize they are being manipulated by someone, most likely Gunther himself. They notice that someone has created a \u201csuper-gravity\u201d setup that pulled their ship down, and after being chased into a cave by monstrous beasts they realize via Hathaway\u2019s self-developing film that the creatures only exist in their minds. Once they figure this out they are able to follow the monsters to their source: Gunther\u2019s fortress inside the asteroid. \n\nMarnagan enters first and is caught by a guard, and tells the guard that his partner is already dead while Hathaway sneaks in. They capture and truss up the guard and replace their oxygen tanks before heading into the fortress proper. They piece together how Gunther has been pulling in ships (including their own) to steal their cargo, and using the telepathic creatures to scare off tourists and inadvertent travelers. They find the machine used to create the creatures and concoct a plan. \n\nHathaway walks toward what he presumes to be Gunther\u2019s residence and allows himself to be captured. He is brought to Gunther, who calls his bluff when Hathaway tells him that patrols have arrived. They hear screams from the plaza and look out to see a line of five-hundred patrolmen. Gunther orders his troops to hold the patrolmen back and they stay to fight, but are vastly outnumbered and easily defeated by the patrolmen. During the battle, Gunther starts shooting a pistol wildly and Hathaway knocks him out with a paperweight before Marnagan enters the building. \n\nWe learn that the line of patrolmen was made up of duplicates of Marnagan created by the telepathic sending station that created the monsters. As the story closes, Marnagan is tracking down the remaining pirates while Hathaway follows him to get some great footage. \n",
            "Interplanetary Patrolman Irish Marnagan and photographer Click Hathaway are on a mission to apprehend a space pirate named Gunther, when a meteor hits their ship, and they crash-land. Marnagan had hired Click to document his capture of Gunther as an educational video for Junior Patrolmen. Click realizes they have an hour left in their oxygen supplies, so they set about to find food, air, and a way to return to Earth. Click suspects the crash was engineered by Gunther himself. As they walk along the meteor, they begin to realize gravity behaves strangely there, and Click wonders if that, too, has been engineered by Gunther. Before he can think on this too deeply, they encounter a horde of monsters of all shapes and sizes coming for them over a hill. Marnagan shoots at them, but they are immune to his shots. Marnagan and Click hide in a nearby cave to hatch a plan. Marnagan poses for some pictures pretending to battle the monsters. Click posits a theory that the strange gravity and meteor attack they\u2019d encountered earlier was Gunther\u2019s way of crashing ships on his asteroid\u2014an effective weapon in an age with primitive space-battle weaponry and a good way to gather supplies while being short on crew. The monsters had been sent to finish the job. When they sit down to examine Click\u2019s footage, they see that there are no monsters in any of the shots. This leads Click to develop another theory\u2014if the monsters weren\u2019t really there, then neither were they! Marnagan tests his theory by walking out of the cave into the middle of the monsters. Because he believes they do not exist, they vanish completely, and the two men realize Gunther\u2019s plan to scare to death anyone who might happen upon his asteroid. At the same time, they are running out of oxygen, and Click says they must bring the monsters back in order to follow them back to Gunther\u2019s base. They bring them back by believing in them, but protect themselves by not being afraid of them. They fight their way through the fake monsters until Marnagan discovers a door leading to a tunnel, and he drops into it. A guard stops Marnagan, and Click uses his camera as a fake weapon to trick the guard into dropping his weapon. After procuring oxygen tanks, Click and Marnagan discover the telepathic sending station from which Gunther transmitted the monster images to ward off visitors. Click has the idea to use this technology to their advantage and trick Gunther and his men into believing the entire Patrol has come to the asteroid. Marnagan stays behind to imitate the 500-man Patrol, while Click goes to Gunther\u2019s hideout to film the fake Patrol\u2019s attack. Marnagan\u2019s fake Patrol defeats Gunther\u2019s men, Click disables Gunther, and Marnagan realizes that Click\u2019s film portrays him as a hero (the film did not capture the telepathically-induced Patrol\u2014only Marnagan storming their ranks). Marnagan gets his educational video, and Click gets his news headline."

Unlike the character Marnagan, who is repeatedly described as physically very large and strong, Hathaway is not on the mission for his physical prowess, but is there to document Marnagan\u2019s capture of Gunther for training of Junior Patrolmen in the future  Hathaway has also invented self-developing film which seems like a cross between Polaroid pictures and a digital camera, as it has to be put into a micro-viewer at the camera\u2019s base to be seen.  This film allows Hathaway and Marnagan, the active partner on the mission, to view Hathaway\u2019s pictures immediately and notice the absence of beasts from Hathaway\u2019s pictures.  This allows for the revelation that the beasts are telepathic projections into the men\u2019s minds and sets up the final \u201cbattle\u201d in the story, in which telepathic projections of Marnagan, created by the same projectors that created the beasts, along with photos from Hathaway\u2019s film, defeat Gunther\u2019s guards and enable Hathaway and Marnagan to capture Gunther.  While nothing could have been accomplished without Marnagan, Hathaway\u2019s photography is essential to the successful completion of the mission.\n",

He is filming the meteor when it strikes their spaceship, and by reviewing the footage, he realizes that the meteor is glowing hot, which is never the case with meteors in space, and concludes that it must have been aimed at them. After he films the monsters and reviews his film, he realizes that the monsters are not real, which enables Marnagan and Hathaway to exit the cave where they are hiding. Later, when a guard has Marnagan, Hathaway holds his camera out like a weapon to make the guard drop his gun. Hathaway\u2019s profession also helps him think of a way to use the telepathic station against Gunther\u2019s guards when he films Marnagan in various movements and then feeds his film into the machine to become thought emanations. The images make the guards believe that 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are on the asteroid and marching toward them. The guards panic and run because they think they are outnumbered.",

            "Despite their clear differences, Hathaway and Marnagan are a solid team who work well together and depend on each other.  We first see this in the opening scene of the story where Hathaway is physically clinging to Marnagan in his distress during the crash sequence.  After the crash, Hathaway is more concerned with taking photos of Marnagan emerging from the crash than helping him emerge from the rubble, not because he doesn\u2019t care about his companion, but because he sees his companion as so strong, it doesn\u2019t occur to him to be concerned for his physical safety.  This points to one of their key differences--while Marnagan is immediately concerned for Hathaway\u2019s safety and assumes Hathaway would reciprocate, Hathaway sees Marnagan as much stronger than himself, nearly invulnerable.\n\nWe see Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s collaborative relationship continue when they are faced with the beasts.  They are both afraid; Hathaway is the first to spot the secure hiding place of the cave and hails Marnagan to run there.  Marnagan then proposes that he pose \u201cwith\u201d the beasts--standing at a safe distance with them in the background--and Hathaway agrees.  They continue to argue about what to do while Hathaway develops the film as part of his argument.  When Hathaway presents the developed film as evidence, Marnagan teases him about his invention being \u201clousy\u201d, as only he (Marnagan) shows in the photos, but the monsters do not.  This joke sets up Hathaway\u2019s realization that the beasts are telepathic projections rather than physical beings, leading the men to debate which of them will lead the hunt for oxygen.  While Hathaway knows his partner is physically stronger and he is already suffering from oxygen deprivation, he doesn\u2019t want to risk Marnagan\u2019s safety if his deduction proves wrong.  Marnagan, however, shows his trust in Hathaway by insisting that he (Marnagan) lead, confident that if Hathaway says the monsters aren\u2019t there, they are indeed not.\n\nWhen Marnagan briefly succumbs to the telepathic illusion of the beasts, Hathaway is able to talk him down.  Just by listening to Hathaway\u2019s words, Marnagan is able to convince himself again that the beasts are not real.  Marnagan then convinces the guard he encounters that Hathaway died in the ship crash, allowing Hathaway to sneak in, capture the guard, and get both the men oxygen.  They use their teamwork in a last instance to defeat the principal antagonist of the story, Gunther.  Hathaway is captured by more of Gunther\u2019s guards and taken to him, but is already prepared.  He shows Gunther that Gunther\u2019s men are being overwhelmed and defeated by five hundred armed Patrol men, causing Gunther to pull out a weapon and fire wildly until Hathaway knocks him unconscious.  We then are told that the \u201cfive hundred Patrol men\u201d are telepathic illusions of Marnagan projected by the same projectors that created the images of the beasts, supplied with photos of Marnagan shot by Hathaway.  Once again their teamwork proves crucial to the success of the mission.\n",
            "Marnagan hired Hathaway to film his search for the elusive pirate Gunther. Marnagan plans to use the film to train Junior Patrolmen how to get out of a difficult situation. The two men are also friends who joke with each other. When Marnagan points out that he could have been killed in the crash, Hathaway frowns and turns pale. When Hathaway first speculates that Gunther caused the meteor to hit their spaceship, Marnagan isn\u2019t convinced that is true, but as they begin making discoveries about the asteroid\u2019s gravity and monsters, Marnagan trusts Hathaway\u2019s theories enough to leave the cave and walk among the monsters. When Marnagan returns unscathed, Hathaway breaks down in tears of relief to see that he is safe. Later, when a guard is holding Marnagan at gunpoint, Hathaway risks his life to save Marnagan by using his camera as a pretend weapon to take the guard\u2019s weapon. He then forces the guard to drag Marnagan, unconscious from lack of oxygen, to get a replacement oxygen tank. The two men also compliment each other when they defeat Gunther and his men.",
            "At the beginning of the story, Hathaway and Marnagan are colleagues; Marnagan has hired Hathaway to document his mission to hunt down Gunther. As the story goes on, they become very dependent on one another in order to survive. They both try to put themselves in harm\u2019s way in order to protect the other (Hathaway wanting to leave the cave first in case the monsters are real, Marnagan telling the guard that the monsters already killed his partner, etc.) multiple times and value the contributions the other makes to their plans. The events of the story bring them much closer, and they effectively save each other\u2019s lives. \n",
            "Marnagan has contracted Click Hathaway\u2019s talents as a photographer and filmmaker to help him produce a video he can use to train the Junior Patrolmen how to handle difficult situations they may face. Together, they seek out Gunther the space pirate and Click documents the journey. Their relationship is mutually beneficial\u2014Marnagan is the brawn, and Click is the brain. They work together to escape the monsters, and, ultimately, to defeat Gunther and his men and procure the footage both of them want for their individual purposes. Throughout the story, both characters engage in witty retorts to one another, but they always show each other respect and a commitment to get through the trying ordeal to survive."

            "The crash of Hathaway and Marnagan\u2019s ship is the precipitating event for the events that follow, but it is also more than that.  Hathaway states shortly after the crash that the meteor that hit their ship was deliberately aimed at them with force, based on it being \u201chot and glowing\u201d at the time of the collision.  Hathaway hypothesizes at that time that Gunther, the man Marnagan is trying to capture on their mission, had engineered the crash.  A short time later, when walking along the surface of the planet, Hathaway notices sudden weight loss.  After he and Marnagan test it and confirm that it really happened, they conclude that their ship was not only hit by a meteor, it was dragged down to the planet by an unnatural amount of gravity, more than the planet is generating.  They then meet horrifying, dangerous monsters, but these are revealed in short order to be telepathic projections.  They are able to dispel the images of the monsters by their own belief that the monsters are not really there, then summon them back by imagining that they are there, but that the monsters cannot harm them.  In this way, the monsters lead them to Gunther, who is captured when Marnagan and Hathaway use the telepathic projectors that generated the \u201cmonster\u201d images to generate hundreds of images of Marnagan, making it appear that there is an army ready to take over Gunther\u2019s base and capture or kill all his men.  All of this flows from the initial crash engineered by Gunther with the propelled meteor and the area of super-gravity that pulled the ship down to the planet.  Gunther hoped to make the ship disappear and Marnagan and Hathaway along with it.  Instead, they crashed on the single planet where they could find him and had to take on an immediate quest to search for him in order to survive, as they had limited oxygen and needed to find the only other humans on the planet in order to replenish their supply.",
            "The crash in the opening scene sets up the conflict with Gunther in the climax of the story. Gunther is responsible for the meteor that strikes the spaceship and makes it crash on the asteroid. He is also responsible for the monsters that first terrify Hathaway and Marnagan and that later lead the men to his hideout inside the asteroid. Hathaway speculates that Gunther crashes or pulls ships onto his asteroid. Gunther is short on men, and space weapons are inaccurate, so he uses super-gravity to crash the ships. The people die from a lack of air or food or their injuries from the crash. Since there are no signs of weapons, if the Patrol ever shows up, it looks like the people died of accidental deaths rather than murder. The crash makes it possible for Marnagan to finally reach Gunter, a space pirate that no one has ever seen before.",
            "The crash of Hathaway\u2019s and Marnagan\u2019s ship in the opening scene of the story is significant both because it brings them to the asteroid where Gunther is hiding, and because it helps them figure out how Gunther is stealing cargo. Their ship is brought down at great speed by meteorites that Gunther and his troops launch at it, and then pulled in by a super-gravity situation they have set up. Hathaway and Marnagan realize the gravity is at play when they seem to lose weight as they get further from the ship. Their own ship wreck experience points them toward discovering how to get to Gunther. \n",
            "The crash at the beginning of the story is perpetuated by a meteor that Click later determines was sent as a projectile by Gunther himself. He presumes this was done in conjunction with the artificial gravity of the asteroid base in order to fell cargo ships to gather supplies for Gunther and his limited crew of fellow pirates. This crash sets in motion the action that forces Marnagan and Click to confront the monsters, whom Click soon realizes are telepathically imposed and not real at all. Because of this encounter with the monsters, Click discovers a way to defeat Gunther and his forces while dealing with limited resources and using his own technology against him. The crash also provides a dramatic moment in Click\u2019s film."

            "Telepathy plays an interesting role in this story.  Rather than telepathy being used by one character to discern the thoughts of another character, as is often the case, we instead have machines creating telepathic projections.  It is fitting, then, that since machines are creating the telepathic projections, a machine can also defeat them.  The camera does not \"see\" through interpreting images or trying to understand them.  It only records light and shadow.  For this reason, it remains unaffected by telepathy--it can only record what is there, not what is projected into the mind.\n\nHathaway and Marnagan become trapped in a small cave by what they believe are dangerous wild beasts.  Marnagan asks Hathaway to take his pictures as Marnagan poses against the backdrop of the beasts.  When Marnagan looks at the photos and complains that the beasts do not appear, Hathaway realizes that the beasts are not physically real, but only telepathic projections in the men's minds.  He and Marnagan are then able to dismiss the beasts and bring them back at will in order to let the projections lead them to their source.\n\nTelepathy plays a significant role again when Hathaway and Marnagan formulate a plan to capture Gunther, the person Marnagan is on a mission to capture and the man that caused their crash.  While the two of them could easily overpower Gunther if he were alone, there are at least fifty guards with him at his base.  Hathaway realizes they can photograph Marnagan in poses as though he's taking over the base and use those images in the telepathic projector against the guards and Gunther.  The telepathic projector turns one Marnagan into five hundred, allowing the two men to easily capture the base and Gunther while the guards flee.  The guards are likely aware of the telepathic projectors, but do not suspect that Hathaway and Marnagan have managed to turn the projectors to their own ends.  By using the projectors, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to turn a very dangerous situation into an easy victory. ",
            "The telepathic projectors create the illusion that the asteroid is populated with a horde of hideous monsters. This impression frightens people whose spaceships crash onto the asteroid so that they will be too afraid to search for the hideout of Gunther and his guards. Hathaway realizes that the monsters are simply images that disappear when people no longer believe they are real when he examines his film of Marnagan with the monsters in the background. When he reviews his film, only Marnagan is visible, so Hathaway realizes that the monsters are not real. Gunther\u2019s telepathic projectors protect him and his men; he needs this added protection because he only has a few men, and Gunther himself is old and crippled, unable to defend himself or move on his own. Just as the telepathic projectors give him protection, they are also his undoing at the end of the story when Hathaway and Marnagan use the projectors against him. They feed in a film that makes it look like 500 Interplanetary Patrolmen are marching toward Gunter\u2019s headquarters, but in reality, it\u2019s only Marnagan with his image reproduced 499 times. Also, Hathaway and Marnagan are able to trick the projector into producing the monsters again to discover where they are coming from. This leads them to find Gunther\u2019s lair where they defeat him.",

They are the source of the monsters that had previously pursued the two after crash-landing on the asteroid. After realizing the monsters are fake, Click proposes that they can push through their ranks by simply disbelieving in their ability to harm them. This turns out to be true, and they are able to make their way to Gunther\u2019s hideaway, where they find oxygen tanks to support them in their next steps. By commandeering use of the projectors for their own purposes, Marnagan and Click are able to trick Gunther\u2019s men into believing Marnagan is the 500-men Patrol come to capture Gunther and defeat his ranks. Marnagan does his best acting like the men, and their images are projected telepathically into the minds of Gunther\u2019s men, who are subsequently defeated. In turn, this provides the footage that both Marnagan and Click desired when they initially began their quest."

The two sit down to have a drink in an empty portion of the club, but they only have a minute to chat before Grannie Annie remembers she has an appointment at the Satellite Theater. She insists that Billy come with her. \n\nGrannie Annie forces Billy to take a seat in the audience, and she takes her place backstage. The show is called \u201cDoctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses,\u201d and it\u2019s a type of gameshow. People and creatures on nine different planets tune into the program, and they ask the geniuses questions. If the show\u2019s experts cannot answer the question, the listener gets a sum of money. Grannie Annie is there to serve as the guest star. \n\nThe show goes off without a hitch. The only remarkable thing that Billy notices is that the audience appears to be mesmerized by Dr. Universe. \n\nGrannie Annie tells Billy that while she was writing a sequel to her latest novel, she met Ezra Karn, and he told her about the Green Flames. The Green Flame is a radioactive rock originally found on Mercury, and the rock\u2019s Gamma Rays have the power to make people and creatures have a strong desire for a leader. Grannie Annie included these fantastical ideas in her recent novel, but her manuscript was stolen. Now, she\u2019s concerned that the rocks and rays will be used by an authoritarian leader. \n\nIn the middle of their conversation, Grannie Annie and Billy are attacked by someone with a heat ray. The pair leaves Swamp City, followed by the enemy. They travel and find Ezra Karn in his home. \n\nKarn takes his friends to the spaceship where the Green Flames are stored. The precious resource is behind impenetrable glass, and it\u2019s clear that whoever controls it made sure it was safe. \n\nKarn is an avid Doctor Universe fan, and he off-handedly tells Grannie Annie and Billy that they ought to make the man the king. Grannie Annie realizes that Doctor Universe is in fact the person hoarding the Green Flames, and he\u2019s using his quiz show to control the minds of the masses so that he can take over as dictator. \n\nWithout warning, Billy and his friends feel an invisible force pushing them and holding down their bodies. They recognize force as the Varsoom, and the only way to stop it is to make them laugh. Grannie Annie builds a machine that allows the group to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast. \n\nWhen Doctor Universe comes on the radio again, Grannie Annie reads one of her science fiction books to the invisible creatures. The plan works, and the Varsoom laugh wildly, which ruins the Doctor\u2019s plans to take over the universe. Grannie Annie says it won\u2019t deter her from writing her novels, and she invites Billy to come along for the research portion of her next project. \n\n",
            "The story starts in a club on Venus, in Swamp City. The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people\u2019s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra\u2019s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book. Their laughter made it into the broadcast, thwarting Doctor Universe\u2019s plans for becoming dictator of the solar system. In the end, Grannie decides she wants to keep writing novels and invites Billy on a trip to Mars for background research for her next book.",
            "Billy is playing pool when his grandmother attempts to enter the male-only Spacemen\u2019s Club in Venus. He runs out to meet her in the lobby then takes her up to the grille where she won\u2019t be seen. They share a drink, while he asks her what she\u2019s doing in town. Grannie Annie, better known as Annabella C. Flowers, is a popular science fiction writer. Before she can explain her arrival, she rushes to the Satellite Theater, taking Billy with her. She\u2019s a participant in the Doctor Universe game show, and she wants Billy to watch. \nAfter the show is over, a racist interaction takes place. The I.P. comes around to break it up, but not before one Kagor was seriously hurt. \nGrannie Annie takes Billy into another restaurant and finally explains herself. She was writing a sequel for her last book and was doing research on Venus. There she met Ezra Karn, an older man with plenty of stories to tell. He told her of the Green Flames, an ore that released gamma rays stronger than any drug known to man. They made people receptive and easily manipulated. \nShe wrote a book about it and included many facts that Karn told her, including the location of the remaining Green Flames. The manuscript was stolen, and now she believes that this person is using the Geren Flame to control people. \nBilly immediately thinks the suspect is Doctor Universe, but Grannie blows him off. She thinks that someone has figured out a way to broadcast the emissions. A heat ray blasts toward them, almost killing Grannie Annie. They rush to the hydrocar and get out of there. \nFinally, they reach Level Five close to Vansoom territory, where Karn lives. The Vansooms are energy creatures, extremely dangerous, and volatile. They take a boat, where a trained hunter-bird attacks them. They survive thanks to Grannie\u2019s shooting skills. They meet Karn at last and he agrees to show them to the shipwreck after they listen to the latest Doctor Universe gameshow. \nThey reach the ship and see that someone has added to it. A network of wires ran across the shipwreck, protected by impenetrable glass. As was the Green Flames. Since they weren\u2019t able to destroy it, the team sets up camp and hatches a new plan. \nAfter being attacked by the Vansooms, they realize that laughter is the only way to fend them off. Grannie Annie decides to broadcast the Vansooms\u2019 laughter over the next Doctor Universe gameshow, where he is to announce his incoming dictatorship. They spend the next day attempting to make the Vansoom\u2019s laugh but only succeed when Grannie Annie reads a chapter from her most popular novel. They broadcast their laughter over Doctor Universe and override his cry for power. \nThey make their way back home, a longer journey thanks to the Vansoom, and are greeted by the news that Doctor Universe failed. Grannie invites Billy to Mars where she will research her next novel.\n",
            "In a future where all planets of the solar system have been colonized, the narrative tells the story of an adventure with science fiction novelist Grannie Annie and her acquaintance Billy Boy.\n\nAnnie has begun to notice that populations in the solar system are displaying curious tendencies. Overall intellectual lethargy and a clear preference to be led by a despot or dictator. Theorizing that this behavior is the result of exposure to a unique radiation of the Green Flame rock, Annie and Billy investigate in the back country of Venus. As they hunt for an answer they are threatened by would-be assassins who are intent on stopping them. \n\nEventually they uncover that quiz show host, Doctor Universe, is amplifying radiation from a cache of Green Flame and broadcasting it throughout the solar system through his visi program. Annie foils his scheme by broadcasting the laughter of the Varsoom as Doctor Universe tries to announce himself as System Dictator. The story ends as Grannie Annie heads off to Mars with Billy Boy understanding that he was fated to join her in her next adventure."

Initially, it appears to just drain some energy, but with increased exposure, the beings search for more direction and guidance, a desire that can be fulfilled by political power of dictators. In fact, it had been used specifically for this purpose on Earth, Venus, and Mars by a dictator named Vennox I. He required that two pieces of Green Flame were in every household, which ensure that the people wanted to look to him for guidance. The stash of this rock that was found in an abandoned ship on the surface of Venus is the last remaining supply, as it was mostly destroyed after the dictatorship ended. When Grannie Annie found out about the supply, through a prospector named Ezra Karn, she decided to use it as part of the plot for her newest novel. However, Doctor Universe used the details of the story to devise his own plot to use the Green Flame to try to start his own dictatorship. He used broadcast technology to extend the effects of the radioactive rock, so that it affected anyone who watched his quiz show. In the end, the plan is not successful, because Billy and Grannie Annie and their team were able to thwart his efforts.",
            "The Green Flames are a radioactive ore that can and have been used to cause great harm. They emit gamma rays that are incredibly suggestive and powerful when consumed. Vennox I, a dictatorship that ruled over three planets in 2710, used the Green Flames to control their people. \nBy placing the ores in every house, they were able to manipulate and oppress their people. The Green Flames\u2019 power can erase all freedom and individual liberty from a planet. \nWith this kind of power, it\u2019s no wonder that they were all destroyed after Vennox I was overthrown. However, a ship containing a tank full of them crashed, leaving some untouched. Their discovery led to Doctor Universe\u2019s attempt at dictatorship. Luckily, he was foiled along the way.\n",
            "Green Flame is a type of rock with a specific type of radiation. When a lifeform is exposed to this radiation, its brain begins to deteriorate and display an acute lack of energy that increases with exposure. \n\nThe rocks were outlawed as part of a push for democratized government and supposedly destroyed centuries ago but a large quantity of the rocks were discovered on Venus.\n\nNow as populations are agitating for dictatorial government, it is suspected that it is due to the influence of Green Flame.\n\nIt was revealed that augmented Green Flame radiation was being broadcast through Doctor Universe's quiz show."

It is immediately clear that Grannie Annie runs the show in their relationship, in part because Billy is willing to risk his reputation at the men\u2019s club in order to make his elderly friends happy. Within minutes, Billy is whisked away to the theater to watch Annie guest star on Doctor Universe\u2019s show, even though she does not explain the plan to him and he has little interest in being an audience member.\n\nAlthough the rest of the world knows Grannie Annie as Annabella C. Flowers, the name she uses to publish her science fiction novels, Billy would never address her so formally. There is an obvious feeling of trust between the two characters. When Grannie Annie gets her novel stolen and worries that there\u2019s a dictator about to take over the universe, she finds Billy to help her solve the case. Similarly, when Grannie Annie spills her guts about her far-fetched theory about her novel inspiring an evil villain to use the Green Flames to control millions of beings, Billy believes her right off the bat. \n\nThe pair get along very well, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s the case when Grannie Annie asks Billy to accompany her on her next trip to research her upcoming novel. Billy simply can\u2019t say no to his friend, whom he deeply admires. \n",
            "At the time that the story takes place, Billy and Grannie Annie had not seen each other in two years. Even so, they trust one another confidently. At the beginning of the story, we see that Grannie Annie has approached Billy to talk about her concerns for the political climate based on the manuscript of one of her novels. Billy admits to the reader that her story of what was happening, told by anyone else, would be hard to believe, but from her he knows there has to be some truth to it. He also trusts her enough to go along on her expedition to find Ezra, the abandoned ship, and the Green Flame. They know each other well enough ability to know that Grannie\u2019s usual drink is a whiskey sour. At the end of the story, although Billy says he does not want to join on a trip to Mars, he admits to the reader that he knows he will join on another adventure, following Grannie wherever she goes.",

Then, he thinks to himself, Of course, I\u2019ll go. \nGrannie Annie shows up at the exclusive, men-only club Billy was playing at and knew he would come with her. Billy acts as her sidekick and trusted partner throughout the story. Despite their age gap, it\u2019s fair to say that their friendship and camaraderie will last a long time.\n",

Grannie Annie learns that the Green Flames were not all destroyed after the last dictatorship when he tells her that he stumbled upon the resource in an abandoned spaceship. \n\nGrannie Annie and Billy find Karn at his hut in the marsh. They ask Karn to take them to the Green Flames, and after some hesitation, he agrees. He knows that the only way to defeat the Varsoom is to make them laugh, but he does not know what exactly they think is funny. He is a huge fan of Doctor Universe, and he never misses a show. \n\nEzra Karn successfully takes Grannie Annie and Billy to the spaceship he previously found. Within moments of laying eyes on it, Karl yells out in pain. He rolls around on the ground, trying to stand but failing. He informs his companions that the force he is dealing with is the Varsoom, and the only way to end the madness is to make them laugh. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to interrupt Doctor Universe\u2019s broadcast to stop him from taking over the universe, it is Karn\u2019s idea to have Grannie Annie read her book to the Varsoom. He does not realize that they will find it funny, but he does think it\u2019s a good way to get the invisible creatures\u2019 attention. He essentially saves everyone, since Grannie Annie\u2019s book makes the Varsoom laugh and laugh and make it impossible for Doctor Universe to control the minds of the masses. \n",
            "Ezra is only present for a small part of the story, but he already knew Grannie Annie as they had met in Venus City. Ezra is a prospector, and he finds his home in the swamps where the Varsoom live. When Grannie Annie and Billy make it to the swamplands and marshes, they find Ezra, and Grannie Annie asks him to guide the group to the spaceship that held the Green Flames he had told her about. He agrees, though he warns the group about the Varsoom, an energy life form that could potentially be dangerous. He refuses to miss a showing of Doctor Universe\u2019s quiz show, but guides the group after the show is over. Ezra was the first person to see the ship they were looking for, and asked about the broadcasting apparatus that was built on top of it. He circled the ship with Grannie as the group split up to survey the area, and once they entered the ship, Ezra tried using his pistol to break the glass that was protecting the equipment. Eventually, after camp was set up, he watched Doctor Universe again as he smoked his pipe. When Ezra suggests that Doctor Universe is a wonderful person to be made a leader, Grannie realizes that Billy was right about Doctor Universe wanting to take over. Ezra, along with the rest of the group, experienced extreme pain as the Varsoom showed up. Ezra reminded the group that they needed to make these beings laugh, and as he did a silly dance, he tripped and fell, which did the trick. Ezra and Billy watch Grannie set up the altered visi set to disrupt the broadcast following day. He set up a lamp for Grannie when she started to read her book to the Varsoom, and once they have the laughter they needed, he turned on the equipment so that the microphone could add the laughter of the Varsoom to the Doctor Universe broadcast.",

The story begins when his supervisor, Burner Chief Callahan, alerts O\u2019Rielly that one of the controls on his burner has slipped, so he sets about resetting the controls to prevent the ship from crashing when it starts its descent toward Earth. He searches his watch room and around the burner looking for a mouse or anyone who might have moved the control. He thinks about Captain Millicent Hatwoody, the ship\u2019s commander nicknamed \u201cOld Woman\u201d, and worries she will exile him to a distant moon if she discovers the issue. During his search, he discovers a stowaway Venusian woman named Trillium on his bunk bed, and she tells him she had moved the control in order to escape the burner room where she was hiding. O\u2019Rielly is struck by her beauty and allows her to shower in his bathroom. While she is showering, Callahan to interrogate O\u2019Rielly and instructs him to take a shower because Captain Hatwoody is bringing a guest to tour the facilities. He reminds O\u2019Rielly of the history of the Earth women\u2019s supremacy over men, which began as a response to the Earth men\u2019s infatuation with Venusian women. When they established dominance, the Earth women returned the Venusian women to their planet. Consequently, the Venusian men warned of war if any Earth men attempted to contact Venusian women. For their part, Venusian women would be killed if they tried to leave. To soften the threat, Venus agreed to let Earth purchase products at a lower cost. O\u2019Rielly reminds Callahan that no Earth man has seen a Venusian woman in 125 years, and Callahan tells the story\u2014an Earth man disguised himself as a Venusian in order to visit his love, a Venusian woman named Berta. When Trillium returns, she reveals that she is Berta\u2019s granddaughter. She hides again before Captain Hatwoody arrives. The captain and her guest, a Venusian ambassador named Dimdooly, investigate the burner, and their interactions reveal conflicting attitudes towards gender superiority on Earth versus Venus. As they leave, Trillium reveals herself, and Dimdooly recognizes her as the Venusian president\u2019s granddaughter. Captain Hatwoody then calls the presidents of both planets, who begin to blame each other and threaten war. Trillium explains that it was Berta, the president\u2019s wife, who taught her how to stowaway, as she had done so herself 125 years prior. She reveals her purpose for stowing away was to draw attention to her revolutionary vision\u2014to convince Earth to stop purchasing products from Venus, thus stopping their cash flow to fund wars. She explains the wars distract Venusian men, and that is why the women are attracted to Earth men. While the president balks, his wife orders him to step aside as she has been elected new President of Venus, and the Venusian women are taking over. Trillium is rewarded with Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship, and Callahan and O\u2019Rielly are sent back to work. ",

He is surprised when one of them has a fusion control two points low in flight since he thought he had set everything correctly prior to takeoff.\n\nHe discovers a female from Venus stowing away on the ship. O\u2019Rielly does not view women of power with respect, but he treats this woman differently and is attracted to her. There is a gender-based arrangement where women from Venus are no longer allowed on Earth, so her presence is highly illegal.\n\nCallahan (O\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior) comes into the room and discovers the woman from Venus, thinking she is named Berta. Berta was the grandmother of the stowaway, who is actually named Trillium. She hides under the bed in the room, just as the Captain and Ambassador step in to see what is the problem with the burner. They look at the burner personally, and then discover Trillium before leaving the room.\n\nCaptain calls an interplanetary emergency and both the President of Earth and of Venus are brought into conference call. Trillium is the granddaughter of the President of Venus. The President of Venus has been married to Trillium\u2019s grandmother (Berta) for 124.5 years. The President of Venus tries to convince Trillium that people from Earth stole her away, but Trillium is clear that she learned from Berta (his wife) how to execute her plan. Trillium was raising awareness to Earth to stop trade with Venus to stop funding their wars.\n\nThe President of Earth cancels all trade with Venus. Berta becomes the new President of Venus through a unanimous vote. There are only females on the planet to vote, as all Venus men are at war for 10 months at a time with only 2 weeks home inbetween. Her husband is furious and does not believe women should hold power.\n\nAmbassador Dimdooly proposes marriage to Trillium aboard the spaceship. The President of Earth welcomes the idea of a female ambassador travelling Earth to create a new trade treaty.

Apprentice Burnerman O\u2019Rielly can\u2019t figure out how one of the burners he was in charge of on a spaceship had a control slip, until he discovers that it was caused by a stowaway: a beautiful woman from Venus, who has a strange and powerful effect on O\u2019Rielly. \n\nHe tries to keep her hidden but she is discovered by his superior, Callahan, who seems to know a lot about the last Earth man to stow away to Venus 125 years ago, and who mistakes the stowaway, Trillium, for her own grandmother, Berta. Trillium seems to want to be found, and is soon revealed to the ship\u2019s Captain, Millicent Hatwoody, and an ambassador from Venus, Dimdooly. Hatwoody alerts the presidents of both Earth and Venus to the situation, and they disagree about what has happened and whose fault it is. The president of Earth thinks Trillium stowing away on an Earth vessel is tantamount to an act of war, while the president of Venus (Trillium\u2019s grandfather) thinks she must have been kidnapped by the Earth men on the ship.\n\nTrillium clarifies that she intentionally stowed away, with help from her grandmother, Berta, in order to ask the president of Earth to stop buying anything from Venus. The women of Venus want the men to stop leaving to fight in wars that the male-dominated government make up reasons to start just to keep the men occupied, and they want Earth to stop funding the wars. As her grandfather is telling Trillium that things are going to stay as they are, the Earth president says she has dissolved all trade with Venus, and Berta enters her husband\u2019s office and announces that the women of Venus have unanimously voted for Berta to take over the presidency and women to unseat the men from power. She has her female enforcers remove her husband. \n\nOn the spaceship, Dimdooly tells Trillium that he loves her and proposes. She is then given his ambassadorship. O\u2019Rielly and Callahan, heavily implied to be the man who stowed away to Venus 125 years ago and met Berta, are no longer under the Venus woman trance, and now the men of Venus are. As the presidents of Venus and Earth congratulate and thank each other, Berta asks that O\u2019Rielly and Callahan be rewarded for accidentally helping with their plan. Captain Hatwoody awards them each five minutes of leisure time, and Callahan thinks they\u2019re lucky to be alive. \n\nAs the story ends, O\u2019Rielly gets Callahan to tell him why the women of Venus didn\u2019t keep him there if they were lonely, and Callahan reveals that because he didn\u2019t have the \u201cearth beards\u201d that men of Venus have to clutch and tickle the women\u2019s ears, he wasn\u2019t of much use to them. \n",

When he returns to his watch room, a beautiful woman from Venus is on his bunk. She explains that she changed the setting because she was in the burner room and couldn\u2019t open the door when it grew too warm for her. \n\nO\u2019Rielly\u2019s superior, Chief Callahan, arrives to see what caused the problem. Callahan discovers the woman from Venus. He reminds O\u2019Rielly that the first flight from Earth to Venus was made one thousand years ago, and the men from Earth immediately fell in love with the women from Venus and brought some of them back to Earth. Women on Earth were angered by the Earthmen\u2019s behaviors and took over the control of Earth. They took the Venus women back to Venus and warned that there would be a war if any of them came back to Earth. The last time an Earthman was near a Venus woman was 125 years ago when he stuffed himself into a luggage bag and made himself a pair of fake ear beards with worms in them to make them move so he could pass himself off as a Venus man. \n\nThe girl from Venus steps out of the shower, and Callahan calls her \u201cBerta,\u201d but she says her name is \u201cTrillium\u201d and that her grandmother\u2019s name is Berta. Trillium is said to look just as Berta did 125 years ago. O\u2019Rielly hides Trillium under his cot just before Captain Hatwoody enters to check on the burner problem. She is also escorting the Dimdooly, the Personal Assistant of the President of Venus, on a ship tour. Just as the Ambassador and Hatwoody are leaving, Trillium makes a loud bump, and they discover her. The Ambassador is certain she has been kidnapped, but Trillium explains that she stowed away.\n\nHatwoody takes everyone to her office where she calls the presidents of both Earth and Venus. The president of Venus is Trillium\u2019s grandfather. He says she couldn\u2019t have stolen away on her own and demands the truth, so she explains that her grandmother, his wife, told her how to do it. Trillium explains she stowed away to bring the cause of the Venus women to Earth\u2019s attention. She wants Earth to stop trading with Venus so that Venus won\u2019t have the money to keep sending its men to wars for all but two weeks every year. The Venus president\u2019s wife interrupts and declares she\u2019s taking over the presidency; she orders her women to take her husband away and appoints Trillium her new ambassador. O\u2019Rielly realizes Callahan was the last Earthman to meet a Venus woman in person and was the one who tried to stow away to Venus. He was caught because his fake ear beards didn\u2019t grab hold of Berta\u2019s ears like real ones do.\n"

            "Callahan is Burner Chief on the ship and has been flying as a professional Burnerman for 125 years. Berta is the first lady of Venus, and the grandmother of Trillium. When O\u2019Rielly is trying to hide Trillium in his shower, Callahan tells the story of when women first took control of Earth: They were not pleased that Earth men were so entranced by Venusian women, and so they took over leadership of the planet and sent all Venusian women back to their own planet. Likewise, Venusian men banned Earth men from interacting with Venusian women under threat of war. This led to an agreement where Earth and Venus could conduct trade together for cheaper prices. Callahan suggests that he was the last man to touch a Venusian woman, and he did so by hiding himself inside a large bag and sneaking through customs disguised as a Venusian man with a long, fake beard. The woman he was sneaking in to see turned out to be Berta, and Callahan says she ultimately rejected him because she could tell his beard was fake, and Venusian women loved to be tickled by real beards. \n",
            "Callahan is a Burner Chief mechanic on the spaceship and has been working in space for 125 years. Berta is the grandmother of Trillium, the female stowaway from Venus. Berta stowed away on a spaceship 125 years ago.\n\nCallahan thinks that Trillium is Berta when he first catches her in O\u2019Rielly\u2019s bunk room. Callahan appears to have had a history with Berta 125 years ago when she stowed away aboard a spaceship. \n\nCallahan and Berta do not interact often in the story, but Callahan is eager to be present when she is discovered by the Captain and to know how the situation will play out given that women from Venus are not allowed to travel to Earth.\n",
            "Callahan is an older officer aboard the ship, and Berta is an older woman of Venus, married to its longtime ruler. As Callahan references the tale of the Earth man who stowed away to Venus 125 years ago, it becomes clearer and clearer that he is likely the man in question. When he first sees Trillium, he mistakes her for Berta, and she says that she is her granddaughter but looks like Berta did 125 years earlier. It later turns out that Berta coached Trillium to use Callahan\u2019s stowaway method (hiding in a ditty bag) for their plan. Though Callahan was as taken with Berta as O\u2019Rielly is with Trillium, at the conclusion of the story we learn that Callahan was sent away from Venus due to his lack of ear beards, and resultant inability to tickle women\u2019s ears. However, he always remembers Berta and assists her granddaughter, and after Berta is elected president she asks that he be rewarded for this. \n",
            "Callahan is the Earthman who is the last known man to interact with a Venus woman 125 years ago, and Berta is the Venus woman he fell for. He tells O\u2019Rielly that the last Earth guy who tried to stay with a Venus woman hid in a large luggage bag to be shipped to Venus and attached to himself a pair of fake ear beards with Jupiter wiggle worms in them to make the beards move. At the time of the story, Callahan is O\u2019Rielly\u2019s commanding officer who catches O\u2019Rielly with a Venus woman on the ship. When he sees the Venus woman, he calls her Berta, but Trillium explains that her grandmother is named Berta, and everyone says she looks just like her grandmother did 125 years ago. Callahan tries to prevent Captain Hatwoody from discovering Trillium is there; when she does make the discovery and contacts the presidents of Earth and Venus, the president of Venus confirms that Trillium is his granddaughter. Trillium reveals that her grandmother, Berta, explained to her how to stow away on the ship and that her grandmother was the Venus woman that the Earthman 125 years ago was trying to see. As the video conference continues, Berta enters the room where the president of Venus is and announces that she has been elected president of Venus by all the women on Venus and is replacing him. She also says that Callahan and O\u2019Rielly are proof that Venus women are no longer a threat to Earth\u2019s peace, and she asks the Earth president to reward them for their assistance in Venus\u2019s revolution. Callahan reveals to O\u2019Rielly that his disguise was discovered because his ear beards didn\u2019t reach out and grab Berta around the ears when he kissed her."

            "Trillium is the granddaughter of the President of Venus and his wife, Berta. One-hundred twenty-five years ago, Berta learned from Callahan\u2019s example how to stowaway and break the rules devised between the two planets. She taught her granddaughter how to do the same, so Trillium took this knowledge to implement her own plan. Trillium represents the women of Venus, who are tired of the lack of attention they receive from Venusian men; the men are far more interested in war and harbor misogynistic attitudes towards women. Likewise, the women rulers of Earth treat men as their inferiors as a result of their lust for Venusian women. When Trillium is discovered, this triggers a meeting between the two presidents of Earth and Venus, and the president of Earth announces that her presence on the ship signifies a breach in their rules. Therefore, the special arrangement between the two planets is ended, and Earth no longer recognizes Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship. As the Venusian president resists, he also learns that his wife Berta has been elected the new President of Venus, and that women will now take over just as they did on Earth. She orders her husband to be taken away. After Dimdooly loses his position, he announces his love for Trillium, which confirms her plan to regain the amorous attentions of Venusian men has worked. As a reward for her role in the revolution, Trillium receives Dimdooly\u2019s ambassadorship.\n",
            "She wanted to bring attention to her cause as a revolutionary and explain that if Earth would stop buying things from Venus, then they would stop funding Venus\u2019 wars like they have been for the past 10,000 years. Trillium explains that women of Venus would like the men of Venus to instead remain on the planet and do useful work. \nHowever, it turns out that Trillium is part of a larger plan for her grandmother to overthrow her grandfather as President of Venus, which they succeed in doing.\n",
            "Trillium\u2019s plan, which she undertook at her grandmother\u2019s behest and with her assistance, was to stow away on the Earth ship to draw the Earth president\u2019s attention to her cause. Berta and Trillium want to beseech Earth\u2019s government to stop supporting Venus\u2019s economy and funding their constant warfare. The women of Venus want the men of Venus to spend time with them rather than constantly going into battle, and Berta and Trillium have devised a way to get Earth to cooperate in their efforts to switch control of Venus from men to women. \n",
            "Trillium plans to follow her grandmother\u2019s plan and stow away on the ship and travel to Earth. She stows away because that is the only way that the women of Venus can get the attention of Earth\u2019s president. She wants Earth to agree to stop trade with Venus so that Venus will no longer have the money to keep its men in wars all the time. She claims that Venus men are so excited all the time about going to war that they don\u2019t have time for the Venus women. It is the Venus women\u2019s desire to be loved that makes them so irresistible to Earthmen. Although the Venus government allows its men two weeks at home from war each year, the Venus women want their men for longer than that so that the men can do useful work. As a result of the stowaway incident, the president of Earth cancels all trade agreements with Venus. Once Venus women have the Venus men under their power, they no longer have any interest in Earthmen. When Trillium\u2019s grandmother becomes president of Venus, she makes Trillium the new Ambassador to Earth."

Similar to Hatwoody\u2019s disgust for men, Ambassador Dimdooly harbors a deep-seated misogyny. Both characters\u2019 innate sexism is reflected in the social orders of their individual planets and are the result of over one-hundred years of conflict.

They each make snarky comments to each other about the inferiority of the others\u2019 respective gender. Their attitudes are reflected later during the confrontational meeting between the presidents of Earth and Venus in Captain Hatwoody\u2019s office. These two characters\u2019 interactions are essential in highlighting the gender conflict that explodes at the story\u2019s end when both Earth and Venusian women solidify their rule over their respective planets.\n",
            "The male staff on the ship call Captain Hatwoody \u201cOld Woman\u201d and she is described in language that suggests she is cold and unfeeling.

He speaks down to the Captain as a \u201clesser gender\u201d. After the discovery of Trillium he bades to handle it himself, because he knows that she is the granddaughter of the President and that her stowing away could be cause for war.\nThe Captain and the Ambassador have tense interactions. The Ambassador does not think the Captain should be in a position of power as a woman and looks down upon the male staff on the ship that stand at her command. \n",
            "The relationship between Captain Hatwoody and Ambassador Dimdooly is a tense professional relationship between two high-ranking officials from societies with disparate cultural values and gender norms. Dimdooly is from Venus, where men are in control of the government and considered the dominant sex, and Hatwoody is from Earth, where the opposite is true. Dimdooly is an Ambassador being shown around the ship of which Hatwoody is the captain. Dimdooly appears to be disgusted at the male crew members taking orders from a woman, and he and the captain disagree about who should get \u201cprecedence\u201d in terms of who will shower first and where based on which of them has the superior status. Their interactions are characterized by an icy civility throughout the story. ",
            "Captain Hatwoody is giving Ambassador Dimdooly a tour of Earth\u2019s ship. When Hatwoody orders Callahan and O\u2019Rielly to attention, Dimdooly sneers at the sight of the two men being subservient to a woman. He acts as if he would never allow a woman to tell him what to do. He also refers to Hatwoody as \u201cthe lesser gender,\u201d which shows that he considers himself superior to women. When Trillium is discovered on board, and Hatwoody starts to handle the situation, he tells Hatwoody to \u201cshut up\u201d and states that he will take care of the matter since he is the \u201cPersonal Ambassador of the President of Venus\u201d and that the incident can lead to war between the two planets.

            "Three aliens from the planet Ortha, Thig, Kam and their Commander, Torp, have landed on Long Island to see if Earth is viable for the Orthans to take over. Thig captures a passing man, an author named Lewis Terry, and brings him back to the spaceship, where Torp decides that Thig should impersonate Terry to learn more about Earth. Terry\u2019s knowledge is transferred to Thig, a process that kills Terry and arms Thig with with all of his memories. He is given plastic surgery to look like Terry, and he goes to live with Terry\u2019s family. \n\nHe is greeted by Terry\u2019s three young children and his wife, Ellen; the children\u2019s affection and Ellen\u2019s kiss lead to sensations that confuse but excite Thig. The story then jumps ahead 12 weeks to when they return from their vacation, Thig having experienced many new emotions and sensations and having become very attached to Terry\u2019s family. He knows that he must report to his Orthan colleagues, but has misgivings about doing so. Upon his arrival back to the ship, he tells Torp that Earth is ideal for their purposes, and Torp commends him and says he\u2019ll recommend that Ortha take it over and eradicate the humans. Thig suggests that they instead disarm and exile the humans, and train them in the ways of Ortha. Torp responds angrily that they don\u2019t need to waste their time with anyone outside the Orthan \u201cHorde\u201d. He asks Kam to check his blood for disease. \n\nThig realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to protect her and the earthlings and says as much to Kam, who attempts to subdue him. After a struggle over Kam\u2019s blaster, Thig kills him. Torp sees what he has done and flies into the type of rage Orthans don\u2019t ascribe to, bludgeoning Thig until he thinks he is dead. Thig takes a blaster from a case above him and kills Torp. He reads in the ship log that Torp has written that Earth is not viable, because it infected Thig with a disease that led to him killing Kam and made it necessary for Torp to kill him. Thig puts the ship on autopilot toward Ortha, takes one of the small auxiliary ships, and heads back to Earth. \n\nHe experiences many emotions, and regrets how callous he was when he first arrived on Earth and captured Lewis Terry. He vows to live as Terry in repayment to his family, and thinks knowing that Ellen doesn\u2019t really love him, Thig, will be his punishment while he strives to make her happy. As he heads toward Long Island, the idea for a story develops in his mind. This one is about a cowboy that visits other worlds, worlds like the ones Thig has seen. He thinks maybe he could write this, and then reminds himself to remember that he is Lewis Terry now. ",
            "The story begins with the protagonist Thig, who is an alien from the planet Ortha, on a mission to investigate Earth\u2019s suitability to be colonized by the conquering Horde he represents. Thig is a bit shorter than the average human with a thick, muscular body and reddish hair. His spaceship is hidden below the sand at a Long Island beach, and after he emerges, he hides behind the brush along a nearby road. He sees a human that looks remarkably like himself. This human turns out to be a Western writer named Lewis Terry, who lives nearby with his wife and children. Lew, as his wife calls him, had been out fishing as he tried to plot out new stories to fund his proposed trip out West, where he could gather research to make his writing more believable. Thig knocks him out and takes him back to his ship, where he and his fellow Orthans Kam and Torp begin the process of transferring Lew\u2019s memories, thoughts, and emotions into Thig\u2019s mind. This allows him to disguise himself as he researches Earth\u2019s environment and the humans that populate it. After undergoing plastic surgery to better mimic Lew\u2019s appearance, Thig returns to Lew\u2019s home, guided by his memories of the past and human emotions. Thig meets Lew\u2019s children and experiences emotions of love for the first time. These feelings are further complicated when he meets Ellen, Lew\u2019s wife, who kisses him and floods Thig\u2019s new Lew-mind with romantic emotions. Thig shows Ellen the treasures he has brought with him from Mars, and Ellen says they can now afford to pay for their trip out West. They spend the next three months exploring the West, during which time Thig plunges deeper into human emotion and is overwhelmed by the beauty of Earth. Upon his return to the ship, Thig attempts to convince Kam and Torp to change their plans about destroying humankind, and they think Thig has contracted some kind of disease. When Kam goes to test Thig, Thig kills him with a decomposition blaster; in turn, Torp beats Thig until he thinks he has killed him. Torp then returns to his desk and makes a note that Earth is probably not suitable for the Horde due to a mysterious disease that had overtaken Thig. Thig kills Torp and returns to Earth in an escape vessel, sending the ship back to Ortha with Torp\u2019s message. Torp goes back to Ellen and the children, intending to spend the rest of his life living as Lewis Terry.\n",
            "Thig appears naked on Long Island and waits for an Earthman to come near. Lewis Terry, a writer of Westerns, walks by Thig. He went out on his boat to fish, and Thig jumps out at Terry and kills him.\nThig is excited to help his people, the Orthans, discover a new place to inhabit. On planet Ortha, everything is done to serve the Horde. The creatures have no families. They instead devote their lives to society. \nOn the spaceship, Thig takes over Terry\u2019s body and gains all of his knowledge. He then undergoes surgery to correct the scars that Terry sustained during the attack. When he exits the spaceship, Thig is surprised to learn that he now holds all of Terry\u2019s childhood memories and understandings about the world around him. \n\nHe approaches Terry\u2019s home and is greeted by his children and his wife. Thig feels pleasure from this interaction, something he has never experienced before. When Ellen talks to Thig, he naturally responds like Terry would without even thinking about it. The family heads out on a vacation in the West.\n\nAfter several weeks, Thig\u2019s family arrives back at home. He loved building relationships with his wife and children, and soon he will need to talk to his fellow Orthans and let them know that Earth is a perfect place for them to take over. He worries about what will become of Terry\u2019s family. Thig enjoys being an Earthman because he is allowed to feel and express emotions and experience the uncertainty of life that does not exist on Ortha. \n\nWhen Thig leaves the house to go to the spaceship, his mind keeps coming up with ideas for new Western novels. He can\u2019t help it since he still has many of Terry\u2019s old thoughts. Torp decides it\u2019s time to head back to Ortha. He will recommend killing all humans. Thig disagrees, and Torp becomes angry. He assumes that Thig has contracted a disease, and he tells Kam to test him. The ship blasts off, and in a fit of rage, Thig chokes Kam. They wrestle over Kam\u2019s weapon, and Thig makes Kam shoot himself in the torso. Torp comes into the room and hits Thig over the head with a gun. \n\nTorp leaves Thig bleeding and alone in the laboratory. When he wakes up, he is injured, but he manages to grab a weapon. When Torp comes back in the room, he begins shrieking. Thig shoots the commander. \n\nThig finds Torp\u2019s note that says that Earth holds some disease that causes insanity, and therefore it is not appropriate for colonization. He sets the spaceship for Ortha and takes an auxiliary ship back to Earth. Happiness overtakes him as he heads back to his new home. He has zero regrets about leaving Ortha forever. Thig now believes in God, and realizes that his duty is to take care of Terry\u2019s family for the rest of his life. He thinks up a Western plot about a cowboy who visits another planet.\n",
            "\nThig and two other Orthans, Torp and Kam, are traveling the galaxy looking for another planet that the Orthans can populate. When they reach Earth, Thig goes out to look for a human specimen that he can capture and take back to the space cruiser to drain the person\u2019s memory and knowledge to help them determine whether Earth will be a suitable planet for Orthan colonization. Thig captures Lewis Terry, a fiction writer with writer\u2019s block and taking the day off to go fishing. Terry bears an uncanny likeness to Thig, and Torp decides to transfer Terry\u2019s knowledge to Thig and have Thig explore Earth to determine whether it will be appropriate for the Orthans. They make the transfer, but Terry dies. They perform plastic surgery to make Thig look even more like Terry; then Thig returns to Terry\u2019s home.\n\nTerry\u2019s children and wife greet him, and Thig realizes he has a warm response to them even though Orthans have no emotions or sentimentality. When Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, tells him he received a check for $50 for one of her stories, Thig immediately comments that the story was worth $100\u2014and is stunned to realize he is thinking like Terry, not himself. He shows Ellen the stones he dug up from an old wooden box that he remembered learning about in Terry\u2019s childhood, and she exclaims they are worth a fortune and will finance a travel trailer and their trip out West.\n\nAfter returning from their western trip, Thig realizes he needs to report back to Torp about whether Earth is an appropriate planet for the Orthans. He knows it is perfect and that the Orthans will destroy every Earth person, and he begins to wonder why they would have to destroy them. As he makes his way to the space cruiser, he comes up with a new Western story to write.\n\nWhen Thig makes his report to Torp, Torp agrees that Earth is perfect for the Orthans and grows angry when Thig asks if they couldn\u2019t just disarm the Earth people rather than destroying all of them. Torp orders Kam to check Thig\u2019s blood for disease. The space cruiser blasts off, and Thig thinks about Ellen and her children with Lewis Terry and realizes he loves them and must protect them. He tells Torp and Kam to turn back\u2014that there is a woman who needs him and the Horde from Ortha doesn\u2019t need Earth. Thig fights and kills Kam, but Torp realizes what is happening and catches Thig off-guard. Torp beats Thig almost to death, and when Thig regains consciousness, he kills Torp and returns to Earth via a lifeboat. Thig decides that he must be Lewis Terry, not Thig, from now on, and he begins to develop another story about the old West."

He is described as shorter than an average human man (though tall for an Orthan man), and thick-bodied with well-developed muscles, average-to-large facial features, and reddish brown eyes. At the beginning of the story, he and two other Orthans, Kam and Torp, are on a mission to find planets considered viable for the Orthans to take over. Thig kidnaps a human man, Lewis Terry, and the Orthans transfer his memories to Thig and surgically alter him to look like Terry. Thig assumes his identity and joins his family posing as Terry. He begins to feel new sensations and emotions around Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, and their kids, and travels with them on a three-month vacation during which he learns what it feels like to be human and to care for a family. When they return and he must make his report to the other Orthans, he truthfully reports that Earth would be ideal to take over but has second thoughts when Torp says he\u2019ll recommend that they conquer Earth and decimate the population. When his pleas to consider just disarming and exiling the humans are met with scorn, Thig becomes angry and ultimately realizes that he loves Ellen and wants to go back to save Earth.

            "Thig is an Orthan who has spent his entire life devoted to the Horde. He has no family or friends, and he has never experienced love or real emotions. He is essentially part of an ant colony, and he spends every day working for the good of society and neglecting his own individuality. \n\nThig is sent to Earth to investigate whether the planet will be a good place to relocate the Orthans. He must find a human and kill him in order to take over his mind and body . Thig quickly finds his victim in Lewis Terry, chokes him, takes him back to the ship, and gains all of his knowledge and his appearance.\nThig is originally on Earth strictly for the mission, but once he joins Terry\u2019s family, he immediately begins to have feelings for Terry\u2019s wife, Ellen, and his three children. As Terry, Thig is affectionate, he takes part in real conversations, and he thinks about plots for Western novels. \n\nHe truly discovers the joy of living on Earth on his three month vacation with Terry\u2019s family. They take in the landscape and enjoy their time together. \n\nWhen he returns, he knows he has to tell Torp and Kam, two other Orthans on the mission, that Earth is a paradise and the other Orthans would love it. However, he wants nothing to do with the mass killing of humans. Although he originally follows through with his plan and returns to the spaceship, he almost immediately regrets his decision. He does not want to see Earth taken over by the Orthans. He finds the strength to fight off Kam and Torp and heads back to Earth, his new home. \nThig realizes that his entire outlook on life has changed, and he can\u2019t go back to being a cog in a machine. He feels real guilt for killing Terry, and he knows the only way to make it up to him is to take care of Ellen and the children for the rest of his life. He will leave the Orthans to colonize another planet, but he feels positive that they will stay away from Earth when the spaceship with two dead bodies returns to his home planet with a note that says that Earth carries a deadly disease. \n",
            "Thig is a man from Ortha who travels around the galaxy with two other men, looking for another planet that the Orthans can occupy. He lands on Earth and captures a human, Lewis Terry, to take to the space cruiser. Thig looks so much like the human that the Orthans decide to transfer the human\u2019s knowledge and memories to Thig and let him explore the planet in the guise of the man. When Thig encounters the human\u2019s family, he begins to have warm feelings for them, although all feelings and emotions have been removed from the Orthans for hundreds of thousands of years. After the family spends three months on a trip out West, Thig has changed. Instead of thinking only of the good of the Horde of Orthans, he now questions that single-minded devotion and considers the Orthans mindless bees who don\u2019t know the pleasure of thinking for themselves and making their own decisions as the Earthmen do. When the family returns home from the trip out West, he reports what he has learned to Torp, who declares that the planet is suitable and the humans must be destroyed. Thig asks if the Orthans couldn\u2019t just disarm the humans and exile them to a less desirable continent, and Torp thinks he must be sick and orders Kam to check Thig\u2019s blood for disease. As they launch into space, Thig is overwhelmed with the desire to protect Ellen; he realizes he loves her. After defeating Kam and Torp and heading back to Earth, he realizes that he thinks like Lewis Terry and must BE Lewis Terry. His Orthan values and identity no longer matter."

The ship from Ortha lands on Long Island in New York, and this is where Thig captures Lewis Terry and takes him to the Orthans\u2019 spaceship, before settling in with his family, posing as Terry. This area of Long Island is near the beach and the sound, and is described as lush and green. The Terry family lives in a small grey house that is somewhat run down. While we don\u2019t travel out west on the Terry family vacation, we do experience bits of it in Thig\u2019s memory, including the Grand Canyon in Arizona and unspecified desert terrain. The story then takes us back to the ship, and a small laboratory aboard the ship, and then inside a smaller ship as it heads back to Long Island. \n",
            "Lew\u2019s family lives near a beach on Long Island. When the story begins, Thig emerges from his spaceship, which is buried below this beach. He sees dense, green brush beyond the beach running along a highway with little traffic. This is where he chooses to hide and waits to overtake Lew. Thig\u2019s interactions with Kam and Torp take place on the spaceship below the beach surface; this is also where they kill Lew during the brain transfer with Thig. Thig reunites as Lew with Ellen and their children at their beach home and joins them on an epic, three-month journey out West where he sees the Grand Canyon and is overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert with its sagebrush and cacti and variety of colors. Later, Torp charts a path back to Ortha, where they will report their findings. Thig kills Torp and Kam aboard the spaceship, and then he commandeers an escape vessel to make his way back to Earth and back to Ellen and the children.",
            "Most of the story, The Quest of Thig, takes place on Long Island. When Thig first appears on Earth, he is standing in the seaweed and sand, looking out at the Long Island Sound. There are trees and lots of greenery along the shoreline. He notes that this planet appears to be perfect for the Orthans because it has sunlight, lots of water, and a dense atmosphere. \n\nTerry\u2019s little gray house has a dilapidated front porch and a screen door. There is an old swing that creaks when it\u2019s used. The family owns a gray car and a trailer.  Ellen makes simple meals for her family in their kitchen. \nDuring the family\u2019s trip out West, they visit the Grand Canyon where they see red dunes in the desert and sagebrush and cacti. \n\nThe other setting in the story is the Orthans\u2019 spaceship. When Thig takes Terry\u2019s body back to his spaceship to take over his body and mind, there are two parallel metal tables in the operation room. Both Thig and Terry\u2019s body wear helmets to transfer the information from one to the other. Later in the story, Thig is taken to the laboratory on the ship to get his blood checked for a disease. The lab is neatly set up with instruments hanging from the wall and weapons hanging from the ceiling. There is also a control room on board. The space ship also has six auxiliary miniature spaceships nested inside the larger vessel. \n",
            "There are three settings in the story, two of which are present in the story and the third is remembered. The first setting is the space cruiser that brings the Orthans to Earth. The space cruiser lands on a beach across the Sound from Connecticut. It is buried in the sand to prevent it from being seen by the Earthmen. It contains a laboratory with instruments and gauges that enable the Orthans to capture the memories and knowledge of another species. It is also outfitted with their decomposition blasters that reduce living organisms to flaky ashes. There is also a control room where Torp guides the space cruiser on its travels through the galaxy and keeps the ship\u2019s log detailing its journeys and findings. Wastes are disposed of with a refuse lock. The ship carries auxiliary lifeboats, which are basically miniatures of the larger ship, for emergencies.\n\nThe setting on Earth is based in Connecticut where the space cruiser lands on a beach. There is sand at the beach, trees and shrubs, highways, and other manmade features. It also features Lewis Terry\u2019s cottage where he lives with his family. It is a weathered small gray house with sagging boards, a front porch, and a porch swing. When the family visits the West, they stop at the Grand Canyon, and Thig is breathless when he sees its beauty. He also notes the sun-painted red peaks in the desert and beautiful starry nights.\n\nThig remembers Ortha as dull, gray, and black and associates it with a monotonous routine.\n"

Their children are raised in laboratories never knowing their parents and are not shown love or affection. They are taught to value loyalty to the Orthan \u201cHordes\u201d over everything, and to believe that they are entitled to anything in the universe that they desire, with no regard to those outside the Hordes. They don\u2019t have mates or have sex, though they do walk around naked. Free thought and primal urges are discouraged, and Orthan society has attempted to filter out any behavior they consider to be barbaric in favor of a robotic, obedient populace. By contrast, Thig discovers that humans feel the full gamut of emotions, think for themselves, and feel empathy rather than the dispassionate callousness Ortha demands. \n",
            "The Orthans are a race totally committed to the advancement of the Horde, which travels around the universe seeking to find new planets to overthrow and inhabit. Over the years, their minds have been programmed to think only of the good of the Horde, with no thought to sentimental emotions or feelings. When Thig receives Lewis Terry\u2019s mind, he also receives his mentality, his thoughts, his memories, and his emotions. He experiences for the first time how humans feel. He describes the warmth of hugging Lew\u2019s children, and the choking-warm sensation of kissing his wife, Ellen. He feels awe when standing before the Grand Canyon and learns to feel excitement about the unpredictability of human behavior and emotion. He feels love, hate, and sadness. All of these emotions stand in stark contrast to the Orthan way of life, which is carefully regimented and devoid of any of these kinds of feelings.",
            "On Ortha, the aliens are raised in the laboratories of their Horde. The Orthans function in a collective society. They do not believe in the individual. There are no families, no romantic relationships or sex, and no friends. Everything that is done must be done for the greater society, much like an ant farm. The Orthans are looking for a new planet to colonize, and they send out Torp, Kam, and Thig on the mission.\n\nOrthans are incapable of feeling emotions and all of their primitive impulses have been done away with. The aliens are part of a strict caste system where they are only allowed to have certain thoughts according to their position in the Horde. They have acted this way for over one hundred thousand years. \n\nOrthans believe they are superior to Earthmen, whom they see as feeble and weak. They believe they have the right to take whatever planet is best for them, and killing billions of Earthmen means nothing to them. \n",
            "On Ortha, men are loyal to the Horde, and that is all they care about. They are cultured and brought to life in laboratories, so there are no fathers or mothers and no affection and love. From childhood on, males and females in Ortha are taught that the only important thing is the growth and power of the Horde. Men and women have no feelings outside of their devotion to the Horde. Men have no mates and children, which prevents Thig from first understanding the warm feeling that sweeps over him when Lewis Terry\u2019s children greet him and Ellen kisses him on the first night he goes to their home. On Ortha, men have no independent ideas or interests; everything they think and do is to maintain the Horde. For this reason, their civilization has remained static for a hundred thousand years.\n\nOn Earth, men and women love each other and marry and have children. Men are focused on the well-being of their families and their own lives rather than on the well-being of their population as a whole. Earthmen have independent thoughts and make their own decisions. People are unpredictable, and uncertainty adds interest to everyday life.\n"

Harvey and Joe are horrified to find out that the water is highly expensive. Johnson explains that the water must be purified.

The sweet water is readily available and it is transported directly to the saloon via this pipe. \n\nHarvey and Joe head back to the bar.

Harvey explains that the only medication that will provide an instant cure is the one they happen to be selling: La-anago Yergis.\n\nJoe is instantly cured once Harvey pours the special liquid into his mouth. Johnson is flabbergasted and wants to purchase an entire case. While in the privacy of their ship, Joe and Harvey discuss their joint desire to purchase Genius.

The water on this planet is so bitter that it must undergo a rigorous purification process to make it drinkable. Harvey and Joe believe him and pay their sum.

They find a saloon manned by a six-armed life-form and a bartender named Johnson. Harvey and Joe ask for water, which they get, but are charged forty buckos, presumably because there is a high price to get water filtered in this area. The men are astounded but Harvey tries to be understanding of the unusual situation, and pays Johnson the money he asks for. It turns out that Johnson is not just the bartender, but also the mayor, among other jobs. He works out a deal for the men to fill their tanks with purified water, claims to give them a bargain price, and sends his assistant out to the pumps to help the men. Although purified water is expensive, unpurified water used as battery fluid is free, and Johnson points the men to the body of water where they can find what they need. As Joe and Harvey are collecting battery water, they find pipes that carry purified water to the saloon from a clean pool\u2014Johnson had lied about the purification system, and thus charged them way more than the water was worth (twice), so Harvey decides they need revenge. Joe pretends to get asteroid fever, which terrifies Johnson, and Harvey concocts a fake medicine using some of the bitter water to convince Johnson to buy a case from him. The back-and-forth of cons continues: Johnson lures them into a meal with inexpensive food but an expensive hidden surcharge for service and entertainment. Then, Harvey \u201cconvinces\u201d Johnson to sell him Genius, his assistant, and Joe and Harvey convince Johnson to buy a radio that they inserted a scrambler into, claiming it had hidden knowledge from the fourth dimension. This whole time, Johnson acts as though he doesn\u2019t have any interest in things he wants to buy, for as long as he can maintain that appearance. However, Joe and Harvey will often get him interested by the end, with Johnson becoming upset when he can\u2019t have what he wants. In the end, it turns out Genius can\u2019t actually leave Planetoid 42, because he would be crushed by a larger planet\u2019s gravity, and Joe and Harvey leave somewhat dejected, hoping that they managed to make some amount of money from the whole ordeal. It turns out they broke exactly even, so they had a good laugh of frustration and went on to Mars to try another plan.\n\n"

Joe is more emotionally charged and tends to complain to Harvey often about the state of affairs they find themselves in. Joe often questions Harvey's approach but falls in line in order to execute his plan.  Even though they work well together, they also fall prey to the deceptions that are set up by Johnson.",

Their experience together makes them very effective conmen. \n\tIt\u2019s clear through their rapport and previously devised tricks that they have been working together for a long time. When Joe feigned being sick to sell the medicine, Harvey guided Johnson along with them and convinced him entirely of the medicine\u2019s success.\n",
            "Harvey Ellsworth and Joe Mallon have very complementary personalities: when we meet them, they show us that Harvey is the levelheaded one who tries to see the best in people, but Joe is much more reactive and has less of a performative air to his demeanor. They know each other quite well, enough that they are able to communicate with each other discreetly to give each other direction while trying to run a con. Harvey is the one who holds on to hope in an interesting sense: he is able to take previous experiences to formulate plans for current predicaments, in a way that means he is not easily rattled. This presents itself in Harvey acting as sort of a leader of the duo, and Harvey comes up with plans and directs Joe as needed. Harvey steers a lot of the conversations they have with others, and when it\u2019s just the two of them, Harry spends a lot of time scolding Joe for his attitude. Even though Harvey tries to see the best in Johnson at the beginning of the story, he eventually agrees with Joe\u2019s anger once they realize that Johnson did not need to purify the water that he had sold them. However, whereas Joe was angry at the treatment they were receiving, Harvey more directly wanted revenge. In the end, when they leave Planetoid 42, we see them connect about their history again, excited to run another con together."

            "Genius is an important character because he is used to illustrate just how brilliant Johnson is. The man is clearly intelligent because he has positioned himself as the sheriff, the barman, and the mayor of Planetoid 42. He also makes money by fooling gullible outsiders into paying high prices for water and food. However, his idea to sell Genius over and over again is perhaps the most shrewd. His asking price for the remarkable creature is in the 600s, much more than he\u2019s able to charge for water or dishes at his restaurant. Johnson pretends that he\u2019s attached to Genius and would hate to see him go, yet he cannot turn down the incredible sum of money. \n\nEach time Genius is sold to naive buyers, he ends up making his way right back to Johnson\u2019s bar, and Johnson profits all of the money. Genius cannot leave the planet because the pressure in other habitats is too much for his unique body to handle. If one of the buyers insisted on bringing him aboard their ship, he would turn up dead and useless to them anyway. Therefore, they always send the poor creature back to Johnson and lose out on their plans to make loads of money off of him. \n",
            "Genius is an alien being with 6 arms. He serves Johnson on Planetoid 42 as an all-around servant. He is coveted by and eventually purchased by Harvey and Joe to be exploited for profit off world. Unfortunately for the pair, after his purchase Genius explains that he cannot leave the planet because the higher atmospheric pressure of an off world environment would kill him. Johnson continually \"sells\" genius to unsuspecting visitors to the planet as a source of income only to have him return.",
            "Genius is the many-armed native that works for Johnson and his son. His 30 fingers and dexterous abilities make him a hot commodity to Harvey and Joe. After they watch him bartend, using some hands to pour glasses, other to sweep the floor, and even more to complete other duties, they start brainstorming all the ways he could be helpful onboard their ship. Or, on the other hand, how much they could get for him once he\u2019s sold. \nEventually, Harvey and Joe decide to make an offer on Genius. Johnson sells his worker for a little over half a thousand buckos. Despite selling him to Harvey and Joe, Johnson forgot to include one minute detail. Genius is unable to leave their small planet, due to the gravity he grew up on. Any bigger atmospheric pressure would crush him. \nGenius is yet another example of the many cons Johnson pulled on Harvey and Joe.\n",
            "The character of Genius acts as a symbol of the things that visitors do not understand about Planetoid 42, and how Johnson uses this to his advantage when he tries to make money off of visitors. When humans first encounter him, Genius seems like an incredible and one-of-a-kind creature who fascinates the visitors, sometimes prompting them to want to take him to zoo. Johnson uses this to his advantage to set a trap, and allows visitors to buy Genius off of him before they realize that Genius can\u2019t actually leave the planetoid. Not only does he look interesting, but he is also very talented and uses his six hands to accomplish many tasks at once. He is able to carry boxes while cleaning, and makes for an incredible waiter as he is able to play instruments while serving food. Johnson has to rely on the idea that the visitors will not think about Genius\u2019 inability to adapt to other planets\u2019 environments, and focus only on his uniqueness. Genius also represents how Johnson leaves out small pieces of information in strategic places. For instance, there is no reason to assume that Genius is able to speak based on the majority of the story, but once he arrived at Joe and Harvey\u2019s ship he explains to them that he cannot go with them. It seems he is a piece of Johnson\u2019s plot, as his assistant, as opposed to being more of an independent character who makes his own decisions, but there is not enough information to say for sure."

            "Joe and Harvey are professional conmen, so they are quite good at swindling innocent victims. They make their money by peddling a fake panacea called La-anago Yergis. The men regularly partake in an act where Joe falls ill and Harvey has to come to his rescue with the extract. Although Johnson falls for this trick and purchases an entire case of the medicine, he also does a great job of getting Harvey and Joe back. At the end of the story, the opposing sides come out basically even in terms of financial gains. \n\nJohnson first demonstrates that he can take advantage of Harvey and Joe when he gives them each eight glasses of water before letting them know that he charges a lot for each glass. The men say they\u2019re thirsty, so he is happy to give them as much as they\u2019d like to drink. Although Johnson says that the water costs so much because it must be specially purified, the truth is that he has access to an entire body of water and there really isn\u2019t any reason to charge so much.\n\nLater, Johnson convinces Harvey and Joe that they\u2019re hungry enough to sit down at his restaurant even though neither one had even mentioned food. He allows them to order their food and believe that they\u2019re getting an incredible deal until he tells them about the fine print on the menu. Harvey and Joe are forced to fork over hundreds of dollars for their meal, and when they threaten to walk out, Johnson reminds them that he is the sheriff on Planetoid 42, and he has the power to arrest them. \n",
            "Johnson has a number of schemes that he uses to swindle Harvey and Joe. He initially charges them for water that he claims is expensively purified when in fact it is naturally drinkable. He overcharges them for a meal using a menu with ludicrously fine print. Finally he sells them Genius even though they can't take him off world. In the end Johnson proves that he is just a good a grifter as Harvey and Joe because he manages to extract exactly as much money out of the pair as they do out of him.",
            "Joe and Harvey arrive on this planet in need of water for their ship and in the hopes that they will be able to make a profit off of it. From the get-go, we know that these men are scheming cons, but Johnson is the first to make a move. He cons them into paying more for the water than was necessary and from there the battle only grows. \nWith every con Joe and Harvey pull, Johnson is right back with them. Although they may stump him in the end with the ingenious radio that picks up the fourth dimension, he got the last laugh what with Genius being unable to leave. \nAs well, when Joe and Harvey count their money in the end, they realize they\u2019re leaving with the same amount they arrived with. Johnson was not only a formidable foe but possibly their equal in terms of scheming qualities.\n",
            "Throughout the story, the two groups of people (Joe and Harvey, the travelers, and Johnson and Genius, the locals) are constantly trying to trick one another in ways that the others do not see coming. Joe and Harvey think that they are excellent conmen; they say they are salesman who are traveling, but show throughout the story that they are the type to find the best deal for themselves in any way possible. Johnson, the man who runs the bar and the legal system on Planetoid 42, is ready to rise to the occasion. In fact, at the end of the story, they break even and neither side has actually gained any money. Whenever Joe and Harvey are trying to pull one of their scams, Johnson maintains an uninterested air and tries to not give away any interest in anything the visitors may have to sell him. He always acts as if he needs to be convinced by something, and does not let on what he is trying to pull something over on Joe and Harvey. He also finds very sneaky ways of getting money from them, playing on the visitors\u2019 limited knowledge of the planetoid and its environment. This is how he originally sells them on the idea that he has to charge for water, but it is not his only tactic. He presents them with a menu that has very inexpensive prices for food, but does not mention the extremely small print on the bottom of the menu that shows an exorbitant service charge for the entertainment. These types of ploys have something in common: he tries to set up a situation to make it look very normal for his environment on the planetoid, but hides the information necessary for visitors to make an informed decision. This includes selling Genius near the end of the story, which is a con he has apparently run many times. Because he expects visitors to not think about the biology of the creatures who live on the planetoid, he is able to sell the flashy exterior, in this case his assistant\u2019s capabilities, while there is always a hidden piece of information underneath."

The crew is made up of Stark, Gilbert, Steiner, Langweilig, Craig, and Briton\u2014the captain, executive officer, crewmember, engineer, part-owner of the probe, and a Catholic priest respectively.\nFrom orbit, the crew scans the moon using various technological instruments. They discover abundant highly developed life forms including a small location of sentient life, possibly of extraordinary magnitude. \n\nThey descend to the moon\u2019s surface near the location of the sentient life. They discover a multitude of plants and animals that are found on Earth, also finding two individuals that appear to be human, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah.\n\nTheir investigation of the surroundings bears a startling resemblance to the biblical story of Genesis. The crew is bewildered to consider that this may indeed be a new Garden of Eden which never fell into sin and was preserved as a perfect paradise.\n\nAfter remaining for a few days, the crew returns to their probe. They remark how immoral it would be to meddle such an unspoiled paradise, but nevertheless begin the process of advertising the world to potential colonizers who would indeed exploit the moon for profit.\n\nSurprisingly, it is revealed that back on the planet that the individuals that were merely posing as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah working with their boss, Snake-oil Sam, to deceive potential colonists, ambushing them upon arrival and confiscating their valuable supplies and equipment.\n\nBack on the probe Father Briton chides the rest of the crew that they had been taken in by an obvious ruse and to inform any potential colonists to prepare for armed resistance. The incredulous crew demands to know the reasoning behind his conclusion.  He casually says that besides what he contended were glaring inaccuracies, the fact that Ha-Adamah refused to play him in checkers despite claiming to have a preternaturally perfect intellect was all the proof he needed.",

After getting some positive feedback, Steiner agrees to scan the rest of the world while his colleagues get some rest. The findings are good, so the crew decides to land.\n\nA man introduces himself as Ha-Adamah (Adam) and his female partner is named Hawwah (Eve). The man explains that he is able to speak whatever language his listener needs to hear in order to understand, and this includes animals like eagles and squirrels. \n\nStark then asks the mostly naked man if there are other humans on the moon. Adam says there cannot be more than one of anything. He then names each member of the crew something different and explains that they cannot be people because the man and woman themselves are people.\n\nThe crew members consume fruit from the garden and are incredibly surprised at their quality. The produce tastes better than anything they have ever eaten on earth. They begin to make the connections between this place and the Garden of Eden, and they wonder if they are dreaming. The man tells Langweilig he is not allowed to eat from the pomegranate tree, and the priest explains that in other languages, it is not the apple that is forbidden in the Garden of Eden, but the pomegranate. \n\nThe crew members continue to silently make comparisons to the Biblical story. Adam tells the men that he has heard about another world in which the people have fallen. He also explains that he has a preternatural intellect. In order to check his claims, the priest asks Adam to play checkers, but he refuses.\n\nThe crew members learn about the large serpent that lives in a nearby cave. Adam claims that if evil is to come to him, it will happen via the serpent. \n\nAfter leaving on their ship, all of the crew members are convinced that they have found an actual paradise, a place that has yet to be touched and has not yet fallen. They are eager to take advantage of the land\u2019s resources and exploit the perfect conditions by selling off the land to settlers. \n\nThe only person who disagrees that this Garden of Eden is real is the priest.

His skepticism convinces his colleagues that their shared experience was in fact fake. \n\nMeanwhile, Adam and Eve take off their costumes and the paint on their bodies that causes them to glow.

The crew of the Little Probe is made up of a typical captain, engineer, and executive officer, but also includes a tycoon and a priest, among others. Stark, the captain, orders his man Steiner to continue running scans overnight so that the crew can land on the moon the next day. When they approach the surface, they recognize various animals that look familiar from life on Earth, including sheep and lions, but there is a bright light they don\u2019t understand the source of. Briton, the priest, is also a linguist so he approaches the two people that they find, and is surprised when he is easily understood. The man, Ha Adamah, speaks English perfectly, and says it is due to a special character of his own language that anyone can understand him. The woman on the surface, Hawwah, does not speak while the crew is there. These two are the only humanoids that the crew notices, and they find that the bright light seems to be coming from the people themselves. The main features on the surface are a large garden and a fountain, and the crew is struck by the resemblance to the biblical story of Adam and Eve. They test the boundaries of the similarities by asking to eat apples, which they are told is fine, but then find that pomegranates are not allowed to be consumed. This does not discount the similarity, as some versions of the story say that pomegranates were the forbidden fruit, and the crew is even more baffled when they hear that there is a serpent there that is the source of evil: they do not meet him, as he is in a cave. After three days on the surface, with Father Briton asking questions all the while, the crew goes back to the Little Prob where they discuss what they had witnessed. Stark was astounded at the purity of the world, and thought it needed to be protected, as did Steiner. Craig, the tycoon who owns 51% of the probe, admitted it was beautiful and would be terrible to ruin, but immediately works on dictating a message to Gilbert, the executive officer, advertising the moon to those who might want to buy or lease land there. On the surface, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah are meeting with the Old Serpent\u2014it turns out that the entire situation was a ploy to draw the humans in, and they regularly kill incoming settlers to take their supplies. Father Briton is the only one who is suspicious, and convinces the rest of the crew that they have to doubt what they had just experienced\u2014besides flaws in logic, he was surprised that his offer of a checkers game had been denied, as it would have been a chance for Ha-Adamah to show off.",

The eppel reports an orange light, meaning the possibility of something extraordinary, but perhaps not.The eppel (the Extraordinary Perception Locator) was created with the intention to find the most extraordinary people, brains, or trains of thought.  \n\tStark, the captain, takes charge and demands they scan the rest of the planet for traces of infrastructure. He sends the rest of the crew to bed, and when they wake up the next morning, the report is back. Negative. They target the possibility of something extraordinary, as reported by the eppel, and make their way to the surface. \n\tAs they land, they take note of their surroundings. No shelters, buildings, or lean-tos. Just land with a lion and a lamb. They spot two people, neither naked nor clothed but bathed in light, and ask Father Briton, the Jesuit priest and resident linguist, to communicate with them. \n\tHe approaches them, talking in English, and the man, Ha-Adamah, replies. He introduces himself and the woman, named Hawwah. Father Briton asks him a few questions about their surroundings and names, and the Man responds with convoluted answers. He points the crew towards the fountain, so they may quench their thirst. Although hesitant at first, the men soon realize this water is the best they\u2019ve ever had: the freshest, bubbliest, and clearest. Their suspicions about this place and the Man and Woman only grow. \n\tThe Captain attempts to question Ha-Adamah, and his answers confirm their suspicions. This place might be Paradise or Eden, the place where humanity was born and disgraced. Ha-Adamah welcomes them and offers the fruit on the trees to eat, except for the pomegranates. Ha-Adamah reveals that he is happy here, but that he has been warned that he may lose this happiness and lead the rest of his life desperately trying to find it again. The Man also shies away from the cave where he says the great and evil serpent lives. The crew, now convinced, leave this land and call it in. Selling it as paradise perfect for ranching, farming, camping, or other industrial uses, they plot their return with settlers to take over the land. Only Father Briton believes paradise is not paradise at all, simply a trick. \n\tThe story flashes back to the surface, where Hawwah and Ha-Adamah are huddling with the Serpent, Snake-Oil Sam. It is revealed that they pretend to be Adam and Eve to draw in settlers, only to steal their equipment and kill them. The Serpent congratulates them on their work, but reminds them that more is to be done in order to farm this new world and get all the equipment they need. \n\tOn the spaceship, Father Briton asks for an armed escort to accompany them. The others laugh him off. "

The second group is nearly able to convince the first group that the moon is an untouched world, almost identical to the Garden of Eden. The crew members spend several days with Adam and Eve, and their elaborate ruse convinces them that Adam and Eve know nothing of death or suffering or ageing. It is only the priest that recognizes that the entire interaction was a con. \n\nAs soon as the crew members leave, Snake-Oil Sam comes out of his cave to give Adam and Eve more directions. He is in charge of the entire sham, and he gives out orders. Sam recognizes that people simply can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be perfect. He has played this game before, and he knows that the crew members will be back with others to try and take over what they see as a paradise. Instead, he will murder them and take their goods to use for his own advantage. \n",
            "The story\u2019s characters fall into two groups: the crew of the Little Probe, and those who live on the surface of the small moon that the Little Probe goes to investigate. The crew consists of six Americans: Stark is the ship\u2019s captain, so he calls all of shots onboard and asks a lot of questions on the surface. Steiner is his right-hand man, who tends to follow what Stark says and runs a lot of scans. Gilbert is the executive officer, who points out that they have to eat an apple to truly test if this reality is indeed the biblical paradise it appears to be, and Langweilig is the ship\u2019s engineer. Craig is the tycoon who owns most of the ship, and wants to rent out land on the moon, and Briton is the priest and linguist who initiates contact on the surface and remains a skeptic throughout the story, eventually convincing the rest of the crew that the whole thing is a trap. On the surface, there are three characters of interest: the Old Serpent, who the reader finds out at the end of the story is in charge of the deception, and the two people known as Ha-Adamah and Hawwah. Ha-Adamah, or Adam, is the one who interacts with the ship\u2019s crew when they visit the surface, and Hawwah, or Eve, does not talk to them while they are there\u2014she does talk, though, and works on the plan with the serpent at the end. It is the serpent who creates the paint that makes Adam and Eve glow as if they are sources of light themselves, and writes the script for the deception.",

Each man serves his own purpose on board their ship. Based on their friendliness and camaraderie, these men have worked together before. Finding paradise was not their first mission. Although Stark is the captain, he often asks favors from Father Briton, the advanced linguist. In commanding him and letting him work, Stark is showing his complete trust in his crew. \n\tHowever, the group of creatures on Paradise interact a little differently. As Father Briton mentions later in the story, it\u2019s clear that there was a powerful Thought (mind or being) on the planet, it just didn\u2019t reveal itself to them. The Serpent, or Snake-Oil Sam, hides out in a cave with the equipment, money, ships, and bone meal that they have stolen from previous settlers. He is the true brains behind the operation. He has Ha-Adamah and Hawwah under his command, and, though they complain about the itchy costume, they are on board with his plan. He is clearly in charge and more manipulative than Captain Stark. \n\tAs the Serpent and his crew act out paradise, Captain Stark and his crew fall for it. All except for Father Briton. But the others don\u2019t listen to him. They only laugh off his ideas and request for an armed escort. \n"

            "Christianity is a central component of the story. The heart of the narrative revolves around the description of the world as a replica of the biblical Garden of Eden. The author goes into extensive detail regarding the aspects of the garden and its inhabitants and how they conform to aspects of the Genesis narrative and how it was understood by religious analysis. It is heavily suggested that here, the Serpent did not succeed in convincing man to sin and fall from grace as was the case in the biblical narrative. As a result, Ha-Adamah and Hawwah (the Hebrew names for Adam and Eve) remain clothed in light and still enjoy the preternatural gifts of creation including a highly advanced intellect, immortality and even an illuminated appearance.\n\nIt is revealed that this depiction is a deception on the part of the moon\u2019s inhabitants. Interestingly, the 4 non-believers on the crew are the most ready to believe that the state of affairs on the planet is indeed supernatural. It is only the clever priest who possesses faith, but employs the skepticism necessary to see through the fraud.\n",
            "Snake-Oil Sam, the mastermind behind the ruse, realizes that the visitors who come to the new world will immediately make connections to the Garden of Eden if there are enough clues to point them in that direction. In that way, the story demonstrates that people are susceptible to believing in an already established story or trope, regardless of how impossible it seems. Since the settlers are familiar with the Bible and the famous story of Adam and Eve, they are preconditioned to believe that another Adam and Eve may exist in a separate world, a world that has yet to be tainted with sin. \n\nThe priest is the only character that sees through Adam and Eve\u2019s show. Although it\u2019s strange that the religious man in the group would be the most skeptical, it\u2019s clear that he has a keen eye for details. He purposefully asks Adam to play checkers with him to test his supernatural intellect, and when Adam refuses, he realizes that he cannot be who he says he is. Perhaps the priest has the most to lose in believing in this illusion, so his refusal to take the con artists at their word shows his true dedication to Christianity. \n",
            "The people on the surface of the moon that the crew of the Little Probe is investigating are part of a very detailed ploy to replicate the biblical story of Adam and Eve. This religious story served as a recognizable type of paradise, which the serpent used to his advantage, knowing that humans would be drawn to something that they thought was perfect. All of the details of the facade were carefully designed around an attempt to make an authentic, tempting environment. This included changing some details from the English-translated version of the biblical story, including giving the people their Hebrew names of Ha Adamah and Hawwah. The other major point of religion in the story is the Jesuit priest who is onboard the Little Probe. It is Father Briton who is the skeptic, asking questions during his stay on the surface to try to uncover the truth of the situation. The rest of the crew are surprised that it is the religious man who is skeptical of the reality of the moon, but he convinces them that he is right, having thought carefully about every detail of every interaction they had on the surface.",
            "\tThe story of Adam and Eve (or Genesis) is one of the most widely known myths. The idea that we, as humans, once inhabited Paradise, but lost it due to our greed and stolen innocence is intoxicating. It explains why life isn\u2019t perfect, why things don\u2019t always go our way, and why people die. \n\tIn In the Garden, this story is explored in a different manner. The Christian origin story acts as a backdrop for this uninhabited planet that a crew visits. After exploring, they are quick to believe that they have discovered another universe\u2019s Eden. And, therefore, quick to destroy it. \n\tTheir religious faith and belief in the story of Adam and Eve adds to the gravity of the situation. If this weren\u2019t a well-known story, then the crew would have been less amazed by the space before them. The perfection of the place, and the potential of Paradise, was what truly brought them in and, eventually, destroyed them.\n"

            "Human sinfulness and its collective fall from grace are referenced in several ways in the story. Ha-Adamah contrasts his world\u2019s perfection with the fallenness that is apparent in the visitors. He claims to be free from the stain of original sin. He presents himself as perfectly happy and not subject to corruption, aging, or death. This is contrasted with Earth's humanity which was fated to \u201close that happiness, and then to seek it vainly through all the ages.\u201d\n\nThe entire crew of the Little Probe agree on the unacceptability of spoiling a pristine world. Even so, they irresistibly and almost gleefully prepare to exploit the world\u2019s riches.\n\nSnake-Oil Sam expounds upon this inclination. He claims that on top of the very real greed of the visitors they\u2019ve deceived over the years, they are capitalizing on the human desire to despoil the unspoiled. This is a clear summation of concupiscence\u2014the inclination for fallen humanity to tend toward sin. It is clear that Sam and his associates are just as fallen as the other individuals in the story, preying on others to further their own goals.",
            "Although the visiting crew members are impressed and in awe of the Garden of Eden, they have every intention of pillaging the place. They love the clean and delicious water it offers and the tasty fruit that is better than anything they\u2019ve had before. Yet, they cannot resist their urge to take over the land and commercialize it. They do not care that their actions will ruin the purity of the land and its two occupants. They are greedy and only want what will benefit them in the end. \n\nLikewise, Snake-Oil Sam recognizes the immense beauty of the untouched world, and instead of trying to preserve it, he entices groups of people to come and try to take it over so that he can murder them and take their goods and equipment. Snake-Oil Sam is cunning because he innately knows that if he can convince settlers that this world is pure and special, they will immediately desire to destroy it. According to Sam, people can\u2019t resist ruining something that appears to be unique and unadulterated. He uses human nature and the desire to control to his own advantage. By convincing strangers that Adam and Eve are simple and kind and unaware of ageing or suffering, he knows that those strangers will return to the land to make sure that Adam and Eve learn all about those topics. They can\u2019t help themselves precisely because humans have already fallen and are predisposed to sinning. \n",
            "Human fallenness can be interpreted as the degraded state of mankind, or as inauthenticity in human interaction. These are both important themes to this story. In terms of inauthenticity, this is the root of the interactions on the surface of the moon. As the crew of the Little Probe is exploring the area where the two humanoids are living, everything they encounter is a carefully staged ploy. The two people on the surface do not let on any of the truth of their situation to the crew, and deliberately lie to them in order to entice them to come back to settle on the moon. This is ironic, as the serpent\u2019s plan for this ruse is heavily based on others\u2019 desires for authenticity in the story they are presented, thus the small changes in various iterations of this illusion of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. In terms of degradation, another central idea is that this moon is a pure and untouched place. However, the serpent knows that this will entice humans to investigate and try to settle there, because of an innate draw to spoil things that are in perfect condition. The crew of the Little Probe recognize this idea in a different way, in that they see this moon as what humankind could have been before it fell, when Adam and Eve fell to temptation. They see this as innocence that would be a crime to ruin, and know that humans of their own world would be inclined to disrupt what was there.",
            "\tThe story of Adam and Eve ends with human failure. Eve, or Hawwah, eats the apple/pomegranate that God told them not to eat. And so she is cursed with painful birth, toiling the land, and eventual return to dust, or death. Both she and Adam are expelled from Eden and their expulsion leads to the creation of other humans. There is no longer one Man or Woman. \n\tHowever in this story, the destruction of paradise is brought about by two separate groups. The Serpent\u2019s crew of actors and props creates a false paradise to lure people in and pillage them. This in itself is an example of human fallenness, failure, or expulsion from Eden. By extorting the idea of paradise and using it to harm others, the Serpent and his crew are fallen humans. \n\tAnd so are the crew of the visiting spaceship. After discovering so-called paradise, their first thought is to destroy it. Their tools are farming, building, and burning, but not preserving. Human greed is what led to the falling, and is also what led to the falling of these two crews. \n"

He is asked to wait at the Red Baron as someone wanted to see him at 8. He waits patiently and is rewarded with the company of Peter Claney, the man who made it back home. Claney instantly tells him to give up on the journey and stay on Earth. Baron asks for details about their trek and what went wrong, but Claney refuses to give him the details. Claney is an older man now with an epithelioma on his face. Although he came to warn him, he quickly learns that Baron may only listen if he hears the truth. So Claney recounts the story. \nMajor Tom Mikuta recruited Claney, Jack Stone, and Ted McIvers to join him. They were to adventure to the Brightside Crossing at perihelion, a more dangerous journey. Temperatures reached up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit at perihelion, but Mikuta was an all-or-nothing man. Stone arrived on Mercury first, soon followed by Mikuta and Claney. McIvers was the last to arrive and they left soon after with three Bugs and one tractor dragging the sledges. Stone was briefed by Sanderson, the head of the observatory, before they left, and the men pored over all images and maps of the Crossing before beginning. \nDespite their high-tech spacesuits and general gadgets, the giant sun still got to them. They were constantly thirsty and hot, and their skin itched and burned. They drove for eight hours, then slept for five. They needed to travel 70 miles a day. It would take 30 days to reach the Center, and then another 30 to reach the pick-up spot. The journey quickly took a toll on Stone, who was the most apprehensive of the bunch. He retreats into himself, while McIvers chatters nonstop to fill the silence. Tension grew among the crew, especially as McIvers put himself at risk by adventuring away from them. \nClaney lead the gang in his Bug, while McIvers and Mikuta flanked him. Stone was in the very back. If Claney saw something suspicious or unsafe, they would investigate on foot before continuing in their equipment. \nAs they travel, they got closer to the Sun, which appeared to be twice as big as it did on Earth. Several drives into their journey, McIvers discovered something truly terrible on one of his forrays. He screamed into the intercom, alerting the others who quickly rushed after him. He stood there, pointing below. There lay a broken, older Bug and two corpses. Wyatt and Carpenter, the original discoverers. \nThey continued on with disheartened spirits until Claney reached a cleft. There was no way to cross it, except for a very small and dangerous ledge. The cleft slowly began to crumble under their Bugs and they\u2019re left in a very precarious position. ",
            "The story is about a man, Baron, who is planning to cross the bright side of the planet Mercury. Right before the trip is about to depart he runs into one of the famous adventurers that attempted it before him, Peter Claney, at a bar called the Red Lion. Peter goes into a long recollection of his experience to Baron, which is interspersed with them snapping back to reality at the bar. \n\nPeter\u2019s attempted Brightside crossing involved a party of four: the Major (a trusted team captain of sorts), himself (who would be in the lead Bug of the expedition), McIver (who would flank one side of Peter along with the Major), and Stone (who would drag the sledges). They began the expedition at a place called the Twilight lab, an observatory for studying the sun run by a person called Sanders located in a 5 mile wide transition between the bright and dark sides of Mercury which had hospitable temperatures for humans to survive.\n\nOver the course of their journey, tensions between them grew tense. McIver started to drive on little side trips during their daily driving in the Bug vehicles. On one of his side trips he discovered the skeletons of the last known explorers that came before them - Wyatt and Carpenter. Peter does not finish recounting his tale before the story closes, but the reader knows he never did successfully make the crossing, although he did survive (because he is presently sitting in the bar with Baron and recalling this tale from the past).\n\nIt is revealed that Peter\u2019s expedition party went beyond the farthest known point explored by humans (due to finding the bodies), and that he thinks a couple of mistakes were made in equipment choices and in not having a person driving several miles ahead to scout the terrain before the entire convoy had to drive through it.\n",
            "An explorer named James Baron waits irritatedly for a stranger in the Red Lion, a bar in New York. The stranger turns out to be another explorer, Peter Claney, whom Baron has been attempting to contact to get the details of Claney\u2019s previous mission to Mercury\u2019s Brightside, as he is the only man on Earth to have survived and attempt to cross the Brightside, and Baron plans to attempt it soon himself. Claney says it can\u2019t be done, and that he\u2019ll tell Baron his story to prove it to him. The rest of the passage takes place within Claney\u2019s story. \n\nClaney tells of his desire since childhood to attempt the journey, and how he met Major Mikuta, who wants to attempt it. Claney joins Mikuta, along with a young acolyte of the Major\u2019s, Jack Stone, and an impetuous, thrill-seeking climber named Ted McIvers. The addition of McIvers to the team is an unwelcome surprise to Claney, and he proves to be headstrong and restless. \n\nThe team plans and strategizes at Twilight Lab at Mercury\u2019s north pole. They set out on their journey with Claney out front and in charge of finding safe passage routes, Mikuta and McIvers flanking him on either side, and Stone pulling the sledges in the rear. They were state-of-the-art protective equipment and travel in \u201cbug\u201d vehicles, but the terrain and atmosphere are treacherous. They grow more anxious as they go, with McIvers driving the rest of the crew nuts with his constant talking and wandering, and Stone growing more quiet and reserved. Their nerves are further troubled by the discovery of two previous explorers\u2019 corpses (the two explorers Claney had mentioned looking up to as a kid). \n\nAs the passage ends, Claney is in a precarious position at the edge of a chasm with only a thin, ramp-like surface that is already shifting as he watches and ponders how they\u2019ll cross. \n",
            "Peter Claney shows up at the Red Lion to convince James Baron not to go on his trip to the Brightside Crossing. Baron has been trying to find Claney for months to learn about his attempt at crossing the Brightside. Claney is the only person on earth who has attempted the ordeal and made it out alive, but Claney says that it simply cannot be done. It\u2019s impossible. \n\nClaney explains that a major named Tom Mikuta recruited him to go on the trip. Major wanted to cross the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, except he wanted to cross the entire surface of the planet. Claney admits he was afraid because he knew the story of the last two explorers who never returned from their trip. He is also fully aware that the only place hotter than the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion is the actual surface of the sun. Claney believes that it can be done, and he agrees to join Major\u2019s team of men. \n\nMajor and Claney meet up at The Twilight Lab, which is near the north pole of Mercury. Jack Stone, another member of the team, arrives with supplies and equipment. Claney is upset to learn that McIvers will also be joining the team. He thinks he is too much of a risk-taker. The men discuss Mercury\u2019s atmosphere, and Claney realizes that there\u2019s no way to prepare for a voyage this mysterious. There will be active volcanoes, but they have no idea where they will find them. McIvers finally shows up, and although he\u2019s late, Major doesn\u2019t make an issue of it.\n\nThe team leaves the lab with a plan to reach the Center of Brightside in 30 days. They need to travel 70 miles per day. McIvers wants to know who will be out four or five miles ahead of the pack to evaluate the surface. Major sternly tells him that isn\u2019t part of the plan - all team members will stay in sight of one another.\n\nBack at Red Lion, Claney tells Baron that the heat was unbearable, even when their suits kept them cool at 70 degrees. The sight of the sun tricked their minds into believing they were melting. The team drives for eight hours and then stops and sleeps for five. Most of the time, the men are unable to get any rest. The only thing that propels them forward is the fact that no one had ever succeeded before.\nClaney crosses Mercury\u2019s difficult terrain, which includes mounds of dust and impassable cracks. At one point, McIvers drives down a long canyon. Claney sees that McIvers is waving to get his attention, so he follows his lead. McIvers finds wrecked vehicles; this is the spot where the two explorers died. Claney begins to experience difficulties with his Bug. He comes to a six foot drop that his vehicle cannot pass over. He sees a narrow ledge that resembles a ramp. \n"

They had never met prior to this trip together, though they had spoken about the intent of the trip and that there would be no fooling around. The Major lets it slide that McIver shows up late, however, he does not approve of McIver\u2019s plan to go ahead of the rest of the party to scout the terrain. This turns out to potentially be one of the big mistakes that foils their attempted crossing.\n\nDuring their crossing, tensions between the crew and McIver become frazzled because they are tired of McIver\u2019s talking and bad jokes. McIver irritates the crew by taking little side trips away from the rest of them as they try to make forward progress through the Brightside. During one of those trips, McIver makes a significant discovery of two skeletons of the last known explorers. It is not known whether he lives or dies at the close of the crossing attempt that Peter is recollecting.\n",
            "McIvers is a climbing enthusiast who is known as something of a daredevil, and is described by Mikuta as possessing skill and luck. Claney describes him as tall, with long, wavy, prematurely graying hair and \u201cclimber\u2019s\u201d eyes that can look drowsy or suddenly very alert. He never stands still and is always speaking, moving, or doing something. He has been invited on the Brightside Crossing mission, unbeknownst to Peter Claney, by Major Mikuta. He casually shows up three days late, having missed the ship that Claney and Mikuta took and conned his way into a different route via Venus. On the eve of the mission, as plans are being doled out, he asserts that he thinks he and Jack Stone should switch roles and he should be given more leeway for movement. He asks if he can go several miles ahead of the rest to scout out the terrain, but Mikuta insists that they will all stay together. McIvers shows his hot temper during this exchange but ultimately agrees. He grows restless during the journey and annoys everyone with his constant talking and wandering. Because of his meandering, he is the first to encounter a chilling sight: the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, the first two explorers to attempt the Brightside Crossing. \n",
            "McIvers is an excellent climber with long gray hair and sleepy eyes. He is fidgety and difficult to take seriously. \n\nMajor Tom Mikuta invites Ted McIvers to join the team on their mission to cross the Brightside of Mercury, and Peter Claney is immediately disappointed. McIvers has a reputation for being a daredevil, and Claney worries that he\u2019s incapable of taking the danger of the mission seriously. Major argues that McIvers is both lucky and skillful, and the team will need plenty of luck and skill on this difficult trip. He also explains that McIvers knows that fooling around is unacceptable. When Claney tells James Baron the story of his trip, Baron agrees that taking McIvers was a huge mistake. Claney tells him that actually, the equipment and the route were more worrisome than McIvers. \n\nMcIvers arrives late to The Twilight Lab, but Major doesn\u2019t chide him. He actually shows up on a freight rocket from Venus because he missed his original chance to get on the ship that Major and Claney took. Major, the leader of the pack, tells McIvers that he will be dragging the sledges, but McIvers tells his boss that he and Jack Stone have already decided to switch roles. He clearly has no issue with challenging authority, and he gets his way. However, McIvers also wants to know who will be miles ahead of the group scouting the terrain, and Major tells him that no one will take that role. Everyone is to remain in sight of one another. Later, Claney reveals that McIvers was right about this suggestion. It would have been incredibly helpful to have a scout out ahead so the team wasn\u2019t driving blind. \n\nMcIvers\u2019 constant talking really annoys Claney and perhaps the other team members as well. He tells the same stupid jokes over and over and repeatedly wishes he had a cold beer. He also begins to go further and further away from the rest of the group members. On one of these tangents, McIvers spots the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two explorers who failed at their mission to cross The Brightside. \n"

            "Brightside Crossing by Alan E. Nourse mostly takes place on the surface of Mercury.  The main characters begin in an observatory equipped to support human life as well as do research on the planet itself. However, they quickly move on in their journey to cross the Brightside at perihelion. Full of craters, gorges, and cracked land, the planet\u2019s surface is incredibly dangerous to travel on. Sulfurous, hot winds blow across the planet. Beyond the towering, rocky spears and jagged gorges lay yellow valleys and flatlands. The gas beneath the surface of the planet can cause volcanic-like eruptions. This gas can also imply rise up from the core and poison the atmosphere around it. Gray dust caused by years of erosion rested atop every surface. \nMercury is an incredibly hot planet, being the nearest to the sun, and the surface reflects that. ",
            "The only \u2018real\u2019 setting is a bar called Red Lion where Baron and Peter are sitting together. All other settings are imagined through Peter\u2019s recalling of past events.\n\nPeter\u2019s story includes settings from the Twilight Lab (an observatory on Mercury in the twilight zone between the bright and dark sides of the planet), in vehicles called Bugs on the surface of Mercury as his expedition party tries to cross the Brightside, and in various inhospitable locations on the surface of the bright side of the planet, including molten lead lakes and volcanoes.\n\nThe surface of the planet Mercury that faces the sun is referred to as the Brightside. Crossing it is extremely difficult due to the environmental conditions. It is described that the bright side of mercury is always facing towards the light as it rotates around the sun, never having darkness over it. It is an extremely hot place (770F), known to have active volcanoes, and an atmosphere that is mostly CO2, nitrogen and heavier gases. Humans must wear specialized suits to keep their body temperature at 75F while on the Brightside. A journey from the twilight zone (the transition between the bright and dark sides of the planet) to the Center of the Brightside would take about 30 days.\n",
            "The initial setting is on Earth, in New York, outside of and then inside of a bar called the Red Lion. It is a quiet and sparsely populated lounge where some other adventurers (Andean climbers, the person who had mapped a previous voyage for Baron) are in attendance. Peter Claney\u2019s story touches briefly on settings during his childhood (presumably somewhere on Earth), Mikuta\u2019s time on Mars, his time with Mikuta on Venus, and New York again, but the primary setting is Mercury. The first area of Mercury they encounter is the Twilight Lab, located near Mercury\u2019s north pole. This is the jumping off point for the mission, and includes a rocket landing, labs and quarters located deep in Mercury\u2019s crust, and a tower with a solar scope. Mercury\u2019s temperature is around -410 degrees F on the darkside and can reach 770 degrees on the brightside. The lab is located in a twilight zone between the two, which is about five miles wide at the pole and allows the area to be habitable. The brightside has ranges of craters, peaks, and faults; some ranges are inactive while others have volcanic activity and shifting below surface level. The atmosphere is as treacherous as the terrain, with Co2, nitrogen, traces of heavier gases, sulfur vapor, carbon disulfide, and sulfur dioxide flowing in constant atmospheric tides from the brightside to the darkside. The first thirty miles of the trek take them through fluffy volcanic ash and into virgin territory full of desolate gorges and intense heat. They see tall, jagged rocks, as well as the yellow, smoky plains below them. They venture closer and closer to the sun, and have to be increasingly cautious of the tenuous surface of Mercury. Based on Claney saying he was ten in 2082, the events Claney describes as well as his meeting with Baron likely occur in the 2100s (or later). \n",
            "The story begins at Red Lion, a place with few patrons. A doorman is in charge of the comings and goings. Several climbers are conversing, including Andean climbers and the first man to cross the Vulcan Crater on Venus. \nClaney then dives into his story about his trip to cross the Brightside of Mercury. The men meet up for their trip at the Twilight Lab near the north pole of the planet. The lab has a rocket landing and a lab, and much of it is deep in the crust of the planet where it is cooler. There is also a tower that houses the Solar \u2018scope. Sanderson, the lab\u2019s manager, is a sun researcher, so his lab is located at the closest reasonable spot to the sun. Its position between the Brightside and the Darkside means that the temperatures only fluctuate about 50-60 degrees. \nMercury is situated on an axis, and the part that turns in faces the sun. This area, the perihelion, is the hottest place in the solar system besides the actual surface of the sun. Here, the temperatures soar to 770 degrees fahrenheit. The surface of Mercury is particularly treacherous. There are many active volcanoes, and the ground shifts frequently, creating cracks and craters that are difficult to see and impossible to cross. The gases present are also dangerous, including CO 2, nitrogen, sulfur vapor, and sulfur dioxide. There is liquid lead and boiling pools of sulfur. \nOn Mercury, the sun appears to be twice as big as it does on Earth. The planet only has 30% of the gravity that Earth does, and it is blanketed with gray ash. Huge cracks in the surface appear out of nowhere, and cliffs rise out of the land, and rocks and rubble and molten lead make driving treacherous. Everything is difficult to see because of the sulfur mist and the volcanic ash. Without filters and screens, humans would be instantly blinded by the light from the sun. \nThere is a deep gorge where the bodies of Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers who attempted to cross The Brightside, lie. Their outdated Bugs crashed there, presumably because they misjudged the surface and did not see the crack in the lan\n"

            "The Brightside Crossing is an undiscovered portion of Mercury. It is the closest planet to the sun, and the Brightside is the surface that is face-to-face with the surface of the sun most of the time, thanks to Mercury\u2019s quick orbit. It is an incredibly dangerous area of Mercury, with temperatures reaching up to 770 degrees Fahrenheit, possibly more. Because of the difficult atmosphere, the presence of dangerous gases, treacherous landscape, and the heat, the Brightside Crossing remained undiscovered and uninhabitable for hundreds of years. \nMajor Tom Mikuta decided to follow in the footsteps of Wyatt and Carpenter and take on the challenge. The promise of power and discovery draws the main characters forward, as well as the idea of being the first. Mikuta claims that if he were to make the crossing, Mercury would be his. The challenge of the Brightside Crossing is the origin of their desire.",
            "It is significant to the explorers because it has never been done before, so being the first would presumably make them very famous. On a greater scale, a successful crossing means conquering Mercury for humanity to the Major. He thinks that if he can successfully cross the bright side of Mercury at perihelion (when the planet is closest to the sun) then man has \u201cgot Mercury\u201d. As in, if they have the technologies, knowledge, and skills to make the crossing at the hottest possible time there is nothing that isn\u2019t possible for humans to do on the planet.\n",
            "The Brightside Crossing is significant because no one has done it successfully, though it has been attempted before. It is also significant because the entire story is about the Brightside Crossing. Baron\u2019s well-publicized upcoming mission to cross it is what brings Claney to speak with him (and try to talk him out of it), and the story Claney tells is about his own experience attempting to cross, as he is the only man on Earth to have survived an attempt (though he did sustain some physical damage). The Brightside gets its name from one of the most dangerous things about it: its proximity to the sun. \n",
            "Many climbers and explorers wish to take on the Brightside Crossing, but it seems as though the trip is nearly impossible. Wyatt and Carpenter, two famous explorers, attempted to make the trip across the hottest planetary surface in the solar system in 2082, and they never returned from the trip. \n\nPeter Claney is the only living man who has attempted the trip and made it back alive. He was not successful in his mission to cross the perihelion, so it can be assumed that he turned back towards The Twilight Lab after his teammates perished. \n\nMaps of the terrain are shoddy at best since, and the surface is ever changing. Volcanoes erupt, cracks appear, cliffs crumble, and photography and technology is not yet good enough to create detailed pictures of the surface that would allow explorers to create a definitive and safe route. Since the men must travel at least 70 miles a day, there can be zero detours. It\u2019s a constant game of scanning the terrain and making last minute decisions about which way is safest. \n\nPeter Claney and his teammates are motivated almost entirely by their desire to be the first people to conquer The Brightside Crossing. They believe that The Brightside would get them or they would get The Brightside. There is no other way, and their fame and success makes the dangerous trip worth a try. \n"

His wits and genius make him an invaluable resource, but his heart wasn\u2019t necessarily in the right place. Claney claims that Stone only came to follow Major Mikuta around, a man he deeply respected and admired. \nAt barely 25 years old, Stone was the youngest member of the team. His experience with Mikuta at the Vulcan qualified him for the trek, or so he thought, and so he tagged along. \nHis apprehension and anxiety about the trip are evident from the beginning. After Sanderson, the leader of an observatory on Mercury, explained how treacherous their journey was going to be, Stone almost cried. \nOnce they begin their trek, Stone retreats further into himself.

Possibly fed up by McIvers\u2019 constant joking or tortured by the fear that he would be lost on this planet forever, Stone became a shell of himself. \nIn the end, after McIvers discovered the corpses of the two discoverers that came before them, Wyatt and Carpenter, we can only assume that Stone\u2019s fear and reservedness increased tremendously.

He arrives to Twilight Lab a few days before Claney and Mikuta to be briefed by Sanderson, and brings the supplies and equipment for the mission with him. By the time the other two arrive, Jack seems somewhat despondent based on what Sanderson has told him about the difficulties and improbability of the mission. Jack is assigned to flank Peter on the mission, along with Mikuta, but agrees to switch positions with McIvers and pull the sledges instead. This seems like something McIvers had pushed for in a previous conversation, but Jack says he doesn\u2019t mind and Mikuta agrees to the switch.

            "The mining for a precious ore called Acoustix has spurred colonization of Jupiter\u2019s eighth moon by two mining companies called Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. There is a barren desert landscape between the mining areas of the two companies that is called the Baldric. The only plant appears to be trees that have melon-shaped tops, and the only animal is a silver parrot-like bird that is capable of imitating human speech, and also of imitating human forms in a holographic-like manner.\n\nGrannie Annie (AKA Annabella C. Flowers) is a famous science fiction writer, who is travelling to the Baldric with her martian employee, Xartal, who takes detailed drawings that are the background research for her next novel. She is travelling in a party of four: herself, Xartal, Ezra Karn (old prospector), and the narrator (called Billy-boy by Grannie).\n\nStrange happenings are known to occur in the Baldric. They encounter a silver bird that repeats English words and creates what seems like a mirage of themselves projected in the distance which disappears as it comes closer. They do not know at the time, but the parrot has created this mirage based on viewing one of the lifelike drawings that Xartal is making of the group.\n\nThey happen to run into Jimmy Baker, the manager of the Larynx Incorporated mining company, who is interested in Grannie\u2019s help sorting out the root cause of his workers coming down with \u201cred spot fever\u201d which causes them to leave their work and walk into the Baldric, never to return. They travel to Larynx Incorporated\u2019s offices with Jimmy, where he learns all of the workers from Shaft Four have left their posts due to the fever. Coincidentally, that is also their most productive ore location. Jimmy, Grannie, and Xartal take off to Shaft Four via the Baldric to investigate what is going on. During their travel, they break for camp near a flock of the birds and discover their ability to imitate human forms.\n\nAntlers Karn, the manager of Interstellar Voice, turns out to be a bad guy who ambushes Grannie\u2019s camp. He is trying to sabotage Jimmy\u2019s company by causing the red spot fever to stop them from capitalizing on a huge deposit of Acoustix they discovered in Shaft Four. He steals Jimmy\u2019s car and kidnaps a mirage-version of Grannie. Billy and Ezra chase them down and discover Antlers has stranded their friends in a valley thirty miles away. \n\nGrannie has independently solved the mystery of the Red Spot Fever and sending her mirage with Antlers was part of her master plan. When Billy and Ezra return to her, Jimmy is projecting ultra-violet light onto a large group of the Shaft Four workers in a deep valley gorge. This counteracts the infra-red radiation that put them into a trance-like state that caused them to wander into the desert.\n\nGrannie, Jimmy, Xartal, Billy, and Ezra are triumphantly returning the workers to Shaft Four at the close of the story.\n",
            "The story starts three days into an expedition on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, led by Annabella C. Flowers, a science fiction author, known by her friends as Grannie Annie. Also in the group were some of her friends: the narrator Billy, the prospector Ezra Karn, and the Martian illustrator named Xartal. The moon was known for Acoustix, an ore that allows aging Martians to improve their supersonic telecommunication abilities. They traveled through the desert to an area called the Baldric, which was filled with cat-tail-like trees and silver cockatoo-like creatures. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice (an Acoustix mining company) had told them about the area. As they continued on, the group had a shock: they saw duplicates of themselves traveling toward them. It was not a simple mirage, as they could hear the others talking. Once they got close, however, the doubles disappeared. Shaking off the odd situation, the group continued, and eventually ran into Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, the competitors of Interstellar Voice. It seemed Jimmy needed Grannie's help: his workers at the mine had been falling sick with Red Spot Fever, which made them wander into the Baldric. The group headed to the Larynx Incorporated offices, where Jimmy admitted that calling off the mining expedition would mean the end of Jimmy's company, so he needed to combat the Fever. Grannie grabbed supplies from Jimmy's laboratory and they headed to the desert with Xartal. Ezra and Billy stayed to look around the offices, and briefly talked to Antlers Park on the visiphone. He had less issue with the Fever, but had an antitoxin that he was willing to share with Jimmy. Through a camera on Jimmy's car, Billy was able to watch the group in the desert as another set of mirages appeared. Grannie excitedly realized that the cockatoos on the moon were copying Xartal's drawings, mimicking the mental images and causing these \"mirages\". Ezra and Billy headed to Jimmy's office to investigate reports, realizing that everyone fell sick in the barracks, not while mining. They found a lens in the barracks that was pushing concentrated rays towards the workers, so they ran to the visiscreen room to find out where Grannie was. They were surprised to see Antlers Park was the only person in the car with Grannie, Jimmy and Xartal nowhere to be seen. Ezra and Billy drove out to meet them, where Billy realized this was a cockatoo and not the actual Grannie. Antlers Park eventually gave up the information about where he had left Grannie and the others, and when Billy and Ezra found them, Grannie showed them the blue ultraviolet light that had been set up to counteract the red rays that cause the fever. It seemed that the lens amplifying the rays to cause the fever was placed in Jimmy's company's barracks by Antlers' company, and the Red Spot Fever was a plan to keep Jimmy's company from becoming more successful than Antlers'.  ",
            "Annabella C. Flowers, known as Grannie Annie, is a famed science fiction writer who summons the story's narrator, Billy, to join her on a mission to the 8th moon of Jupiter, where she ostensibly plans to observe the setting for her next novel. She also invites her constant companion, a prospector name Ezra Karn, and her illustrator, a Martian named Xartal. On the moon, the team unites at the offices of Interstellar Voice, a company managed by Antlers Park. Upon Billy's arrival, Antlers updates him on the history of the company; Interstellar Voice and their rival company Larynx Incorporated mine the moon for its resource of an ore called Acoustix, which is popular amongst Martians because of its ability to revitalize their supersonic vocalizations that dwindle around middle age. Between the properties of these two companies stretches a vast desert known as the Baldric, which is home to a bird-like species resembling cockatoos as well as flagpole trees. Grannie Annie plans to cross in order to further observe the moon's environment and make way to Larynx Incorporated. Antlers Park warns them vaguely of danger in the Baldric, but the team leaves anyway. During the course of their journey, they observe the cockatoos and discover their ability to mimic human voices. In addition, they discover an alarming visage--from their perch atop a high cliff, they see four travelers, seemingly themselves in exact 3D duplicate, walking along the same path they'd just traversed. After this odd discovery, they meet Jimmy Baker, who arrives in his car guided through the air attached to a kite, and Grannie Annie reveals the true purpose of their trip is to help Jimmy resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. His workers have been stricken with Red-Spot Fever, which causes them to abandon their job and walk into the desert; Jimmy worries this will destroy his business. After Grannie Annie, Xartal, and Jimmy Baker leave to tour his company's laboratory and Shaft Four, Billy and Ezra stay behind and tour the offices of Larynx Incorporated. An employee shows them an updated visiphone from which they can view Grannie Annie's journey, and they witness them stopping by a cockatoo nest, where a cockatoo observes Xartal's drawings and uses its ability to mentally mimic images to recreate his drawings of the team in 3D just as they saw previously in the desert. When Billy and Ezra discover a device in the workers' bunker that has been used to spread Red-Spot Fever and see Grannie Annie is returning with Antlers Park, they rush to meet them. Billy realizes this isn\u2019t the real Grannie Annie, but rather her 3D image, and they hurry to stop Antlers Park. After a chase, Antlers admits he set up the Red-Spot device in order to sabotage his business rival. When they reunite with Annie, she and Jimmy and Xartal are using ultra-violet rays to combat the infra-red rays that ignited the Red-Spot Fever in order to draw them back to Larynx Incorporated.\n",
            "Grannie Annie, Ezra Karn, and Billy-Boy are on Jupiter\u2019s Eighth Moon. Xartal, a Martian, is also there to draw illustrations for Grannie Annie\u2019s book. The group meets with Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice, and he tells them about the Baldric, a stretch of land that connects his company, Interstellar Voice, with Larynx Incorporated. The two companies are competing to harvest Acoustix. Acoustix is an ore that amplifies Martians\u2019 thoughts so that they can continue to speak to Earthmen even in their old age when their ability to produce vibrations diminishes. Park warns that the Baldric is dangerous, but Annie is undeterred. \n\nAnnie, Ezra, Billy, and Xartal arrive at the Baldric and spot a cockatoo. Xartal draws the creature and the group members in his notebook. Moments later, Annie spots four figures that look just like herself and her crew members walking on the other side of the hill. The apparent mirage disappears quickly.\n\nBilly sees a kite car, and minutes later Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated, approaches the group. His company is in trouble because a lot of its workers have come down with Red Spot Fever. The workers become talkative and then they walk out into the Baldric. Annie, Jimmy, and Xartal head out to investigate. Billy and Ezra stay behind, and they check out an invention of Jimmy\u2019s - a three-dimensional screen that makes them feel like they\u2019re right there with their group members. They speak to Park on the contraption, and he says that he will give Jimmy the antidote to Red Spot Fever. Billy spots his own likeness on the screen, and he\u2019s shocked.

At the barracks, Ezra finds a piece of metal with a lens on the wall. The infra-red rays from Jupiter are causing the plague; the lens was put there to amplify those rays, and they sicken the sleeping workers. \n\nBilly and Ezra return to the screen and see Park driving a kite car with Annie by his side.  While the men follow Park\u2019s car, he tries to shoot at them. He fails, and Ezra uses a tool to grab Park by the throat. Billy and Ezra find Annie and hundreds of Jimmy\u2019s workers. The group has set up a large ultraviolet light that works to fight the infra-red rays that cause the fever. It was Park all along who was forcing the men to become sick because he did not want Jimmy\u2019s company to be competitive. Park had tried to get Grannie Annie sick as well, but he ended up taking her duplicate image in the kite car instead of the real one. \n"

It is a desert-like place with trees that are trunks with melon-shaped tops, and silver birds that can repeat English phrases as well as mimic human forms that appear like mirages. There is also a deep valley gorge within the desert and many eyries which seem similar to oases.\n\nThere are several scenes aboard kite-propelled cars in the Baldric, as well as visiphone-like video feed of Jimmy\u2019s car that is viewed from the offices of Larynx Incorporated.\n\nShaft Four is one of the locations that Larynx Incorporated mines in on the border of the Baldric, which is talked about often, but is never actually visited by the main characters during the story.\n",
            "The surface of Jupiter's Eighth Moon is covered in desert with huge trees that look like giant cat-tails, long thin poles with a melon-shaped part on top. It is very windy, which pushes all of the desert sand around a lot. The \"flagpole trees\" mark the edge of the Baldric, an area defined by the trees and a cockatoo-like creature. When Antlers Park said that the area would be trouble, Grannie knew she had to investigate. The Baldric itself acts as a line between the areas controlled by the two mining companies, and the mines themselves are where the work happens. Most of the surface, then, is covered either in sand or rock. The other major location in the story is the headquarters of Larynx Incorporated, which is also on Jupiter's Eighth Moon. In the headquarters, there are barracks for the miners, which have huge windows made of denvo-quartz. There is a commissary where people can eat, and a number of administrative areas such as Jimmy's office, and a large visiscreen room where the characters at the headquarters are able to track the movements of the part of the group that left to investigate Red Spot Fever. ",
            "The primary action of the story takes place on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, where Grannie Annie assembles a team to help Jimmy Baker resolve the labor issues at his company, Larynx Incorporated. Although the team assembles at the headquarters of Jimmy's rival company, Interstellar Voice, they never go inside, and immediately make their way across a vast, desert-like area known as the Baldric. The manager of Interstellar Voice, Antlers Park, warns them of threats in the Baldric, but they never run into any such danger. Instead, they observe two of the Baldric's most unique characteristics: The flagpole trees that look like vertical cat tails topped with a melon-like protuberance and the bird-like creatures resembling cockatoos that build large, transparent, web-like nests between them. The cockatoos are silver and look like parrots with a crest and have the unique ability to mimic not only the sounds of a person's voice but also the 3D image of their visage in exact duplicate. As the team makes their way across the desert, they are pelted by wind and powdery sand and climb a high ridge from which they are picked up by Jimmy Baker flying his kite-guided car. These vehicles appear to be the main mode of transportation for representatives of both companies on the moon. The final unique setting of the story is Larynx Incorporated, which is comprised of offices and crew bunkers in a large central building, several mining shafts spread throughout the Baldric, a laboratory, a commissary, and an experimental shop. From one of the many offices in the building, an operator shows Billy and Ezra an update to the visiphone that allows viewers to witness 3D events remotely. Later, Billy and Ezra examine the barracks, housed in a low, rectangular building with a dome roof.",

Two companies, Interstellar Voice, and Larynx Incorporated are at war with each other to harvest the most Acoustix ore. The companies are located about 10 miles away from each other, and in between them is a space called the Baldric. The Baldric is covered with Flagpole trees. They stand straight up and have a bulbous fruit or vegetable that grows out of the very top. The entire surface is covered in sand, and wind is an ever-present feature of the atmosphere. There are also hundreds of birds that look a lot like cockatoos. The birds look at Xartal\u2019s drawings and then project those images out of their minds. This makes it appear like there are two Grannie Annies or two Billys, when there is really just one. The cockatoos\u2019 ability to project images is similar to their ability to repeat words and phrases that humans say. \n \nThe characters also venture inside of Larynx Incorporated, the company owned by Jimmy Baker. There are offices, glass doors, counting machines, and report tapes there. The offices are where they package the Acoustix ore to ship it to their customers. The most interesting part of Larynx Incorporated is Jimmy\u2019s invention, an improvement on the visiphone called a visiscreen. Viewers can be taken to a location and the three D image that\u2019s created makes it feel like they are there, experiencing everything along with the group. \n"

Visiting Jimmy was Grannie's primary reason for traveling to the Baldric, and Jimmy seems to need her help. In fact, he thinks she is the only one who might be able to solve his problem. Grannie is excited to help, and is intrigued by the puzzle he has for her. The two of them seem to work well together; Jimmy trusts Grannie to go with him to investigate the issues, and Grannie has some good ideas for him. In the end, they are able to uncover the issue and find a way to help Jimmy's workers. ",
            "Jimmy Baker is the congenial manager of Larynx Incorporated, and Billy immediately likes him. When Jimmy picks up Grannie Annie and her team in the Baldric, he mentions how relieved he feels to have her there to help him with his labor problems. Jimmy is a realist, and Grannie Annie is a science fiction writer, so his pragmatic thinking and her creativity work well together to put a stop to Antlers Park's plot to sabotage Jimmy's business. Because of her stubborn insistence of carefully observing each setting for her potential novels, Grannie Annie has developed a quick and keen understanding of unusual phenomena she discovers in her travels. This helps her determine the cause of the 3D duplicates of themselves the cockatoos create and also helps her to quickly deduce Antlers' scheme. When Antlers attempts to force the Red-Spot Fever upon Annie, Jimmy, and Xartal, Annie's creativity leads her to pretend to contract the plague, so that Antlers will leave them to enact the rest of his plot. With Antlers gone, Jimmy and Annie work together to develop the plan to remove the windscreen from his kite car and replace it with an ultra-violet radiator that could be used to guide his lost workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",

Jimmy needs his workers to stay on task and mine the ore, Acoustix, so that he can sell his product. Without the miners, Interstellar Voice will undoubtedly win the race and Larynx Incorporated will become obsolete.

Martians are able to speak out loud as Earthlings do by supersonically amplifying their thoughts. As Martians grow beyond middle age, they are no longer able to do this amplification without the assistance of the Acoustix ore. Thus, it is highly valuable to them.\n\nThe ore is the only reason for colonization of Jupiter\u2019s moons, and there are two main companies that mine it - Interstellar Voice, Larynx Incorporated. It becomes a source of greed, which causes the manager of Interstellar Voice (Antlers Karn) to attempt sabotage against the other company, serving as the main climax of the story.\n",
            "Acoustix is an ore found on Jupiter's eighth moon that helps older martians continue to amplify their thoughts with their supersonic communication methods that usually deteriorate once the Martian hits middle age. Although there is no use for it on Earth, it is the entire reason there is colonial presence on the moon, and the reason for the presence of the companies Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated. The ore is therefore the primary point of competition between the two companies, and when Larynx Incorporated finds a new, rich source of the ore, Antlers Park decides he has to take action to keep Jimmy Baker's company from getting ahead. This is why Antlers made a small device to make the rays more concentrated, to shine them on the workers in the barracks, to give them Red Spot Fever. This would allow him to take over the area that is rich in ore.  \n",
            "Acoustix is an ore unique to Jupiter's Eighth Moon and is the reason for the presence of the mining operations of Intersteller Voice and Larynx Incorporated. As Antlers Park informs Billy, although the ore is useless to Earthmen, the Martians highly value it. Because Martians speak using a supersonic method, they are able to amplify their thoughts via high-frequency wavelengths. As they get older, this ability decreases, and the Acoustix has the ability to restore that ability to its previous strength. Jimmy Baker's company, Larynx Incorporated, has discovered a massive reserve of Acoustix that would essentially put them far ahead of their competition, and therefore Antlers Park works to sabotage them by spreading Red-Spot fever amongst his workers, knowing their discovery would hurt his own business, Interstellar Voice. Jimmy worries that the labor shortage will impair his company's ability to mine Shaft Four, which produces their largest share of Acoustix, and will lead to the termination of his charter through Spacolonial.",
            "Acoustix is the ore that Larynx Incorporated and Interstellar Voice are both harvesting and selling. As far as anyone knows, Acoustix can only be found on this moon of Jupiter's. The ore is useless on Earth, but Martians use it to continue to communicate with Earthmen after they have reached old age. Martians create wave lengths with their thoughts using vibrations. After they become older, they are unable to create the same frequency of vibrations, and therefore lose the ability to speak with others. The Acoustix ore revitalizes the organ they use to create the vibrations, and it gives them the gift of communication once more. \n\nAntlers Park does not want Jimmy Baker and his company to outdo his business, Interstellar Voice. The men share access to the Baldric, which is where the miners are harvesting Acoustix. If Park can get Baker out of the way, he will have the whole stretch of land to harvest for himself, and he will be the sole person profiting off of the moon. He hatches a plan to make Baker's employees sick with Red Spot Fever so that they walk off the job and leave the Acoustix to his miners to gather and sell. \n\n"

Normally, people on this moon aren\u2019t coming down with the fever from their regular activities. However, a lens-like device mounted in the window of the worker barracks at Larynx Incorporated projects the infra-red rays from the great spot around the room onto the sleeping workers which puts them into this trance-like state.\n\nAntlers Karn is responsible for causing the Red Spot Fever by having the devices installed in his competitors' barracks. He also claims to have developed an antitoxin that would reverse the fever, however, it is implied that this was only a lie to cover up his actions.\n",

When someone is watching them to try to see where they are going, they stop until they can slip away. This is a big issue for the mining companies that rely on their workers for survival. The Fever comes about by the infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot, and exposure to these rays over time causes the Fever in humans. The good news is that the infra-red rays can be combated with ultra violet light, which we see Jimmy Baker and Xartal use at the end of the story, shining the light on the miners to counteract the exposure.

            "Jimmy Baker believes he is losing his workers to onset Red Spot Fever, the symptoms of which include extreme talkativeness followed by a tendency to wander away and disappear. Following the discovery of the massive store of Acoustix around Shaft Four, his workers began wandering into the vastness of the Baldric. Billy and Ezra confirm Jimmy's suspicions when they discover a device hidden in the barracks at Larynx Incorporated that concentrates and amplifies the power of the infra-red rays from nearby Jupiter's great spot. The device operates on a timer so that it beams onto the workers as they sleep. Antlers Park admits to having installed the device because he feared the resultant competition from Jimmy Baker's discovery of the deep Acoustix vein. In order to combat the Red Spot Fever, Annie and Jimmy concoct a plan to utilize Jimmy's kite car as a makeshift beam from which to cast ultraviolet rays upon the wandering workers. Since the rays are at the opposite end of the vibratory scale, they can be used to subvert the symptoms of Red Spot Fever and draw the workers back to Larynx Incorporated.",

The lens works to amplify Jupiter's infrared-rays, and the rays hit the men while they are sleeping. The workers are affected by this contraption because it makes them extremely talkative and forces them to walk out of their mines. Importantly, Billy looks through Jimmy Baker's folder of victims and makes a connection that the men are becoming sick while they are sleeping, and not while they are working. This gives Ezra and Billy the idea to go to the barracks and look around, and that's when they find the lens that amplifies the harmful rays. \n\nGrannie Annie is able to solve the problem by hitting the infected men with ultraviolet light which counteracts against the infrared-rays.

Purnie is careful not to disturb the animals he sees along the way because he has frozen time, and everything must resume normally when he unfreezes it. He knows that time-stopping is forbidden for animals his age, but he chooses to believe that his family will be proud of his bravery. \n\nFinally, he sees the ocean in front of him, and he resumes time. He does a head-stand and feels weak and dizzy. These feelings are a result of the time-stop, and he knows it. Purnie approaches some humans on the beach. A man named Forbes is in the middle of explaining to his captain, Benson, that he has found 17 planets to claim as his own. Forbes is hellbent on raising his FORBES flag as soon as possible. He is eager to stake his claim to the land and says that his mission is much bigger than real estate alone. Benson retorts that yes, his mission is bigger than just real estate because his paperwork says that Forbes will own all of the inhabitants of the planets he claims as well as the land. \n\nThe crew members use a special machine and  find radiation emanating from Purnie. Forbes demands that they put the animal in a box. Benson protests and reminds Forbes that it\u2019s against Universal Law, but Forbes insists. Purnie experiences his first-ever impulse to run away with fear when a noose comes towards him. He goes back to pick up his fruit, and Forbes shoots him in the leg. When the man throws the noose again, Purnie involuntarily stops time. He drags himself up the knoll where he originally came from. \n\nThe humans are astonished when time resumes and Purnie is not where he was a split second ago. They spot him up on top of a pile of petrified logs, and suddenly the logs fall down the hill and pin the men down. Purnie is shocked and regretful. The whole thing was an accident. He deliberately stops time and uses all of his remaining strength to lift the logs off of the humans. Purnie begins to lose consciousness, and he knows that he must resume time or he will die. After pouring all of his strength into this action, time does begin again. The humans resume life and feel as though they have gone mad. They know that they were just facing death by drowning, and now they are free. The logs were so heavy that it would have taken superhuman strength to move them. Forbes, in particular, has really gone mad, and he laughs to himself uncontrollably. Benson believes that Purnie was responsible for moving the logs, but of course that seems physically impossible. \n \nPurnie stares off at the beautiful ocean views and watches the men leave in their vehicle as he dies. \n",
            "On his fifth birthday, Purnie--a small, kangaroo-like creature with large eyes--runs through the forest as he goes to see the beach for the first time. Bemoaning the fact that days are so short, he triggers his ability to stop time. He marvels at the bees frozen in mid-air and reminds himself to not abuse his time-stopping power or it could drain all of his energy and kill him. Before arriving at the beach, he gathers some fruit for lunch and then pauses atop a small, rocky hill from where he takes in his first view of the ocean. Purnie is overwhelmed and thrilled at the idea of making friends with the new animals he sees: three-legged tripons, a flock of spora, and, further down, a group of ten humans making their way onto the beach. When he unfreezes time, Purnie climbs down the rockpile and runs around the beach, showing his new animal friends his headstand technique. Next, he visits two humans, who barely notice his presence. Captain Benson is the hired leader of the expedition; Forbes is a wealthy real estate investor who owns seventeen planets and considers himself a \"pioneer\". Forbes explains to Benson that coming to the planet is a mere formality as he has already staked his claim to make this planet his eighteenth; planting a flag emblazoned with his name is a symbolic gesture. Benson's men wish to explore the new planet and its native species, but Forbes is impatient to build his flagpole and leave. He has no interest in learning about the creatures there, only in owning their land and tripling his investment over time. Purnie wants to play with the humans, and Forbes expresses his annoyance and tries to get a crewmember to take him away. One of the crew members, Miles, checks the planet's surface for radiation while Benson and Forbes investigate the rockpile where Purnie had perched earlier to see if the rocks may be used to support Forbes' flagpole. After they determine the rocks are extremely heavy petrified logs and cannot be moved, Miles alerts them that Purnie is emitting a large amount of radiation. Forbes orders the crew to capture Purnie so he can take him home, reproduce him, and profit off of his radiation resource. As Purnie evades capture, thinking he is playing with the men, Forbes grows impatient and shoots him, causing Purnie to instinctively stop time. Injured, Purnie takes shelter atop the petrified logs, which fall under him and crush the humans below. Panicked, Purnie rushes to remove the logs, using up his own energy. When he unfreezes time again, the men are astonished. In one moment, they were crushed by logs, and in the next, the logs had disappeared. This drives Forbes insane, and he laughs as they take him away to the ship. Having exhausted all of his energy saving the men, Purnie watches them leave, succumbs to his wounds, and dies.",
            "Purnie, a five-year-old creature, is off from school for his birthday and takes a secret trip to see the ocean. When he is near enough to smell the ocean, Purnie freezes time even though he has been warned about the amount of energy this takes, and there is a maxim that small children who stop time without an adult may not live to regret it. When he reaches the shore, he recognizes the petrified logs, spora, and tripons from his brothers\u2019 descriptions and is delighted to find two-legged animals there as well. Purnie approaches the two-legged animals who are actually humans and speaks to them but is ignored. The humans discuss the men who are curiously looking at the animals around them, and Forbes, the leader, orders Captain Benson to have the men work right away. Purnie follows the men closely, and Forbes gets annoyed and kicks at him. They talk about this being Forbes's eighteenth planet, and Forbes wants his flag planted and a cornerstone and plaque installed. One of the men gets a strong reading on his scintillometer, a device that detects radiation. Tracing the reading, they find it is coming from Purnie. Forbes orders Purnie put into a lead box, thinking radioactive animals can reproduce and provide an endless supply of radioactive materials. Benson is reluctant because putting Purnie in the box will kill him, and it goes against Universal Law. Forbes reminds him of their contract, and Benson has his men try to rope Purnie, who thinks it is a game and playfully comes near the box before running away. When Forbes loses patience, he shoots at Purnie to wound him. Stunned, he stops and sees the noose coming toward him. Purnie freezes time again, limps away, and climbs to the top of the bluff. When he restarts time, the men are shocked he is no longer there on the beach with them. Spying Purnie on the bluff, they approach him; Purnie shifts, causing the logs to slide down and hit the men. Purnie is shocked and saddened at their suffering and feels awful he caused it. He realizes some of the men will drown because they can\u2019t move and the tide is coming in, so he freezes time again, pulls the logs off the men, and drags them onto the beach. At the top of the hill, he restarts time, and the men are puzzled to be back on the beach with the logs off them. They question their sanity, and Forbes really has gone insane. The men help those who are seriously wounded, disarm Forbes and tie his hands together, and return him to the ship. Benson wonders why Purnie would come back to the humans who tormented him and goes back to the beach looking for him. He calls out for Purnie, tells him they made a mistake, and he would like to help Purnie if he is hurt. When he doesn\u2019t see him, Benson leaves.",

It tires Purnie to use time-stopping, and if done too much it can kill the user.\n\nPurnie leaves brothers and parents in a village in the forest and stops time while venturing beside a stream towards the ocean. Upon reaching a cliff overlooking the orange colored ocean, Purnie restarts time and discovers a group of human space explorers that are attempting to claim the planet and have only been onshore for 20 minutes musing at the strange creatures they are finding.\n\nForbes is from San Diego and has a history of claiming planets, this current one being the 17th if successfully staked with his flag, cornerstone, and plaque. He orders around Captain Benson and the rest of the crew, in a hurry to claim the planet upon their arrival.\n\nPurnie thinks the humans are friends to play with and tries to interact with them on multiple occasions. When the crew discovers that Purnie is radioactive, Forbes orders them to capture it and place it in a lead box to bring to Earth, which Forbes thinks will make him very rich. Purnie\u2019s confusion about their hostility leads to an involuntary stopping of time which is used to return to the top of the cliff. Accidentally, Purnie sets off a rock slide after restarting time from the location on the top of the cliff and sets off a rock slide while peering over the edge that traps most of the humans under rocks and petrified logs along the beach and in the ocean. Deep horror causes Pernie to once again stop time, go down to the beach, and move all the debris off the humans - saving their lives.\n\nWhen time restarts once again, the humans are completely baffled as to how they were rescued, and Forbes loses his grip on reality entirely - having to be tied up by the crew for their return trip. Captain Benson wonders why a creature they tried to capture and kill would have come back to their rescue from their almost certain deaths and goes looking for Pernie as the crew prepares to leave. Not finding Purnie, the spaceship takes off, and the final sight of Purnie\u2019s life before dying of exhaustion from using the superpower is a floating wet flag of Forbes' in the ocean.\n"

            "Forbes is the head of the expedition to claim planets, and Benson is the Captain of the crew. Forbes provides all of the money to make the trips possible, and he pays Benson\u2019s and the other mens\u2019 salaries. Captain Benson is responsible for keeping all of the men safe and making sure the trip goes smoothly. \n\nAlthough Forbes is Benson\u2019s superior, Benson does feel the need to speak his mind to Forbes. When Forbes demands that Benson\u2019s crew stop dawdling and hurry up and put his FORBES flag up, Benson tells Forbes that they are only humans. Of course they are interested in the new environment and want to take a moment to look around. He is not afraid to tell Forbes that capturing Purnie or injuring him is against Universal Laws. Benson does not want to take part in illegal activities, and he scoffs at Forbes\u2019 remarks that he is a pioneer and not a real estate developer. He openly tells Forbes that he knows he will triple his money after claiming these planets, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing it for the greater good of humanity. Benson also asks Forbes if he\u2019s going to take his 17 new planets back home with him to San Diego. It\u2019s clear that Benson has little respect for Forbes and the way he conducts his business, but at the same time, he needs a job and Forbes is providing him with an incredible opportunity to survey all sorts of different planets.\n\nBenson has to face Forbes\u2019 wrath when Purnie goes missing after Forbes shoots him and they attempt to put a noose around his neck. After Purnie unfreezes time, the men are confused as to what they just saw. Forbes turns to Benson and tells him that he is holding him responsible for this mishap even though there is zero evidence that Benson did anything wrong.\n\nAfter the logs fall on the men and Purnie uses all of his remaining strength to save their lives, Forbes is completely out of his mind. Benson finds it a bit humorous, especially since he has an inkling that Purnie, the bug-eyed creature, was behind the whole thing. He does not respect Forbes and thinks his disconnect to reality and repetitive laughter is what he deserves for the way he treated Purnie, himself, and the crew. \n",
            "As a wealthy real estate investor who hires Captain Benson to lead the expedition to the new planet, Forbes treats Benson with a great amount of flippancy and disrespect. He disregards Benson's request to let the crew explore the planet before rushing to build his flagpole to symbolically stake his claim there. He completely ignores Benson when he shows concern for Purnie's well-being when Forbes wants to capture Purnie and take him home to profit off of the radiation in his body. While Benson cares for the safety of his crew and the lives of the new species they discover on this new planet, Forbes only sees ways in which he can personally profit and build his real estate empire. Forbes infuriates Benson when he shoots Purnie, and he goes so far as to call him a fool in spite of Forbes' warnings against talking to him with disrespect. While Benson attempts to understand how Purnie was able to evade capture, Forbes simply wants to maim Purnie and blame Benson for his own mistakes. When the crew gets pinned by the logs dislodged accidentally by Purnie, Benson's instincts are to find and help as many people as he can, including Forbes. ",
            "For the most part, the two men seem to tolerate each other. Forbes has employed Benson to hire men to explore the eighteenth planet that Forbes intends to claim as his own. As the employer, Forbes uses his position to order Benson to carry out his demands, although sometimes Benson questions Forbes's orders and resists carrying them out. Benson also questions Forbes's right to claim all the planets he is claiming and pokes a little fun at him at times. When Forbes wants Benson to order his men right to work after they arrive, Benson counters by asking if Forbes is human since they\u2019ve only been there twenty minutes, and the men are curious about the new planet. Benson also needles Forbes when the men discover radiation, pointing out that he will make enough money to buy his next planet. Forbes is unimpressed with the discovery of radiation since they\u2019ve found some on each of his other planets so far, but not in significant quantities. Forbes is most concerned about staking his claim by installing his flag, a cornerstone, and a plaque. When Benson questions the importance of the flag, Forbes tells him it signifies an empire, development, and progress. When Benson says Forbes will practically own the people who buy real estate on Forbes's planets, Forbes angrily replies that it is he and other people like him who risk their own money to give Benson and others space ships and places to go so they can get away from their thirteen-story tenement houses. Once it becomes clear that Purnie is the source of the large amount of radiation their equipment is detecting, Forbes orders Benson to have the animal put in one of their lead boxes meant to hold radioactive minerals. When Benson starts to remind him that this is forbidden by Universal Law, Forbes asserts his authority, reminding Benson the planet is his, and he is the law. After Purnie avoids capture and Forbes wounds him, Benson calls Forbes a fool and tells him to put his gun away, but Forbes claims he just nicked the animal. When Purnie escapes their attempts to rope him, Forbes blames Benson for ruining everything and is determined to capture Purnie himself. Benson tries to stop him, but Purnie shifts on the pile of petrified logs, sending them onto the men. When Forbes goes mad at the end of the story, Benson orders his men to take his gun from him and tie his hands together as they take him to the ship. \n",
            "Benson is the captain of Forbes\u2019 expedition spaceship that has landed on the ocean shore of an alien planet. Forbes is very much in charge and makes repeated orders to Benson throughout the story that he obeys. Benson attempts to keep the peace by following and acquiescing to Forbes\u2019 sometimes unethical orders (like placing the creature, Purnie, in a sealed lead box that would kill him). Benson has a sensitive reasoning that Forbes does not possess, like when he thinks it possible Purnie may just come along without being sealed in the box, and when he wonders why Purnie would return to rescue the men that had tried to capture him.\n"

There is blue moss on the forest floors, bubbling streams, and orange pools of water. There are also bees, purple clouds, petrified logs by the ocean, and three-legged animals who eat seaweed. The orange ocean waves crash against the sand, and two moons hover in the sky. Humans have never touched this land, so Purnie is surprised that he has never heard his brothers or parents talk about the two-legged animals who make strange sounds. He does not understand that they have just landed their ship here and are experiencing the land for the first time. ",
            "The story takes place on an unnamed planet home to a great amount of biodiversity. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with large, bugged-out eyes; there seem to be several of his kind on this planet as well. There are forests with plentiful foliage, tall trees, and blue moss. The sky above has two moons and makes the trees seem endlessly tall with its low, dense, purple clouds. Throughout the forest flow milky-orange streams and whirlpools; bees buzz about pollinating paka plants. Purnie runs through this environment filled with the joy of life and makes his way to the ocean, driven towards it by its acid-sweet smell, and gathers fruit along the way. When Purnie arrives at the ocean, he stands atop a large rock pile, which turns out to be comprised of heavy petrified logs. He has stopped time, so everything he sees is frozen mid-action: The orange-and-white waves of the ocean tower mid-break, and he sees a flock of spora flying overhead, three-legged tripons chewing on seaweed, and a group of humans. According to the human crew member, Miles, there appears to be a great amount of radiation present on the surface of the planet as well as its creatures. ",
            "The setting is on a planet similar to Earth, with a varied landscape featuring forests, oceans, and valleys. Purnie lives in a village where there is a school that he and his brothers attend. There is a nearby ocean on the other side of the forest that separates it from the village. The forest is colorful with patches of blue moss and a stream with milky-orange water with little whirlpools, bees and other creatures, and low-hanging purple clouds. The forest extends for quite a distance because Purnie has never been to the ocean before. It is lush with foliage, including paka plants, plants that produce pollen and fruit, and tall trees that seem to reach as high as the clouds. From his brothers\u2019 descriptions, Purnie knows what to expect at the beach, but he is still amazed when he sees everything for himself. The forest ends at a rocky knoll formed by petrified logs that overlooks the sea with its orange waves higher than a house and breakers coming onto the shore. There is a flock of birds called spora who land on the beach in a deep glide and humorous three-legged tripons that stand in the water and eat seaweed. As day ends, two moons appear in the sky, and their light is bright enough that Purnie can see the men leaving to return to their ship. \n",
            "On an unnamed Earth-like planet with orange water and purple clouds, there are creatures with spoken language that communicate amongst themselves, but are not able to communicate with humans when they speak.\n\nPurnie adventures away from his family village, along a small stream in the forest to a cliff by the sea, where it innocently tries playing along the water\u2019s edge with human explorers attempting to make a claim to the planet. Most of the story takes place in this beach location where the ocean is orange colored, there is a tall cliff with petrified logs piled up along its edge, and many hiding places. \n\nThe creatures on the planet are all very different to what humans are used to seeing, which creates a distracting setting for the crew through the story.\n"

            "Although Purnie is an animal and not a human, he plays a very important role in the story. Through his understanding of the world, we learn that he has never felt real fear before. This makes sense because although he has been warned about stopping time, and he has explicitly been told that it could lead to his death, he decides to go ahead with his birthday plan anyway and stop time and see the ocean. When the humans throw a noose at him in an attempt to capture him, he is shocked to find that his body instinctively runs from it. He doesn\u2019t really experience the fear because he wants to play with them and has no interest in leaving the fun, but his natural impulses as an animal save his life at this moment. Humans have never before visited his planet, so this means that no other animal Purnie has come in contact with has made his body react this way. \nPurnie also demonstrates how evil Forbes is for trying to capture and kill such an innocent and caring animal. When Benson reminds Forbes that it\u2019s illegal to shoot or capture Purnie, Forbes does not care at all. He wants the animal that is emitting radiation because he believes he can make a profit off of him. The value of Purnie\u2019s life means nothing to him. However, as soon as Purnie feels as though his \u201cfriends\u201d are in danger, he is willing to risk his own life by stopping time to help them. Purnie feels guilt, regret, and sorrow when he accidentally causes the petrified logs to fall on the men, yet Forbes has none of those feelings when he shoots Purnie in the leg and causes him pain. \n",
            "Purnie celebrates his fifth birthday by taking his first-ever trip to the beach to take in the sights and meet new friends with the animals his brothers have told him about. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with the ability to stop time and an extremely upbeat and friendly attitude. Not only does he want to be friends with every animal he encounters, but he also wants to share his lunch with them and show them his ability to do a headstand. Purnie lives in harmony with the forest and its creatures and contrasts with the human explorers who come to lay claim to his planet. Purnie uses his time-stopping ability to extend his birthday because he feels there is not enough time in the day to enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. When he encounters the humans, he is curious because he has never seen their kind before. He listens to the funny sounds they make and follows them persistently, trying to share his lunch with them and demonstrate his headstand. When Forbes orders the men to capture him, Purnie believes they are simply playing a game, and he obliges by evading them. Even after Forbes shoots him, Purnie maintains his positive view of the humans and is more confused by what he did wrong than he is hurt by his actions. This further demonstrates Purnie's naivete and purity of heart. Although his family had warned him about the fatal danger of using his time-stopping powers for too long, Purnie cares more about the survival of the humans he perceives to be his friends and therefore sacrifices his own life to save them when they are crushed by the petrified logs.",
            "Purnie is a mischievous creature with the ability to stop and restart time who innocently causes a tragedy that he then tries to set right. Purnie is out for a day of exploration for his birthday when he comes across the humans on the beach. The humans have no interest in him until they discover Purnie is radioactive; then Forbes, the man financing the expedition and claiming the planet as his, orders them to put Purnie in one of their lead boxes. He is excited that animals are radioactive because they can reproduce and provide him with an endless supply of radioactive material to make him extremely wealthy. Purnie doesn\u2019t know this, of course, and tries to engage the men in play with him. When he realizes they want him near the box, he teasingly runs close to it then away again. When Forbes shoots Purnie, Purnie sees the noose coming toward his head and instinctively stops times. This allows him to evade capture, make his way atop the bluff, and watch from a safe distance once he restarts time. The men are puzzled at Purnie\u2019s sudden disappearance but plan to catch him when they see him on the bluff. As they approach, Purnie accidentally triggers a rockslide of the petrified logs that spill onto the men, trapping them where they are. Purnie is horrified at what he has caused as he hears the men\u2019s cries of pain. He also notices that the tide is coming in, and the men will drown, so he stops time again, removes the logs from the men, and drags them onto the beach where they will be safe. After everyone is safe, Purnie restarts time, and men are incredulous to find themselves suddenly freed from the logs and on the beach. Forbes goes insane. Before they leave, Benson goes back to look for Purnie and offers to help him if he is wounded.\n",
            "Purnie creates the juxtaposition of innocent youth against corrupted power in adults. Purnie\u2019s role is of childlike wonder in trying to interact with what it thinks are new friends along the shoreline - while those very friends attempt to capture and kill it. \n\nBecause Purnie is unable to communicate with humans, it also acts as a mime-like guide to the story, providing many physical actions that convey its emotions rather than language. Purnie\u2019s ability to start and stop time creates pause for the reader to exist in the moments of great emotion that Purnie experiences - joy adventuring to the beach, confusion in trying to be captured, horror in thinking it has killed the humans. Ultimately, this superpower drains Purnie to the point of death.\n"

            "Forbes believes he can control anyone and anything he comes in contact with. His first order of business upon landing on the gorgeous planet is to put up his flag emblazoned with his name. When Benson reminds him that the crew members are interested in taking a moment to look around, Forbes reprimands him for suggesting that they have the right to waste his money. He believes that putting up his flag is a symbol of defeat, and he is incredibly eager to take over a planet he literally just landed on and knows almost nothing about. He incessantly talks about the 17 other planets he has already conquered, and he calls himself a pioneer. Although Forbes definitely makes a lot of money by claiming these planets, he is more interested in the control and fame it brings him than the money he will inevitably make. \nThe first time that Purnie freezes time to escape the noose after Forbes shoots him in the leg, Forbes is incredibly confused but willing to blame the glitch on Benson. He shot Purnie after explicitly being told not to, so he assumes that Benson secretly managed to aid Purnie in getting away. He is furious at this act because capturing the animal emitting radiation is very important to him. He doesn't care if it\u2019s illegal or immoral. He wants control of the planet, the animal, and the crew. \nThe second time that Purnie freezes time, Forbes cannot simply ignore it. He knows that he saw the petrified logs falling down the hill, he knows that he saw several crew members pinned under the logs, about to drown, and he knows that he himself was in a near-death situation one second and saved in the next. There is simply no explanation in his mind for what occurred, and his brain can\u2019t compute the mysterious event. He laughs hysterically because he can\u2019t process the information that his brain receives. He was about to die, and now he is perfectly fine, and he has no explanation for the chain of events. \n",
            "When Forbes shoots Purnie in an effort to try to capture him and bring him back to Earth to exploit his radiation for profit, Purnie instinctively triggers his ability to stop time. He uses this opportunity to retreat back to his perch atop the pile of petrified logs. When he unfreezes time again, Forbes and the rest of the crew are astonished as it appears he has disappeared right before their eyes and reappeared atop the logs. As Purnie moves across the log pile, the logs begin to slip and roll down toward the beach, crushing the men and pinning them to the beach. As the surf begins to cover them, Purnie fears they will drown, pauses time, and begins to save them one-by-one as he slowly bleeds out and expends his energy. Once he has removed the logs from all of the crew members, including Forbes, he once more retreats to the top of the hill and collapses, exhausted. His mind un-freezes time, and the men are once more flabbergasted as it appears the logs have disappeared from their bodies in the blink of an eye. Purnie has saved them, but the experience is too baffling and too overwhelming for Forbes to process. He goes mad, and the men carry him away back to the ship.",
            "Forbes goes mad after Purnie stops time, removes the petrified logs from the men, and moves them up to the beach out of reach of the water so they won't drown. All of the men knew that the logs were so heavy they could not have moved them. And because the men don't know that time can be stopped, they have no idea how they moved from where they were or how the logs were pulled off them. After time resumes, Forbes is seen sitting in the water, talking about his seventeen planets that will do anything that he says. However, he says this planet has a mind of its own. Forbes is astonished that the rocks seemingly moved on their own. Forbes laughs continually and comments that he will hold Benson personally responsible. The men speculate that Forbes will never be the same after this experience. In fact, they take his gun so he can\u2019t shoot any of them, and they tie his hands before they take him back to the ship. \n",

Forbes thinks he is rooted in reality, and then all of a sudden Purnie no longer exists, or the entire crew has been saved by what must have been superhuman strength to move petrified logs off their bodies.\n\nWhen Forbes can\u2019t make sense of mysteriously being rescued from near-death in the ocean, he doesn\u2019t know what is real any more. He goes mad into a giddiness of having done what he considers capturing this strange and wonderful planet for himself.\n"

They attempted to conceal their killing of a farn beast on that trip, however, the word got out and now Extrone has forced them (seemingly against their will) to be the guides for his own trip. Ri and Mia do not turn out to be very good guides. Mia is unsupportive of Extrone and suspicious of his activities and potential plans to violently attack the aliens, and Ri is fearful of that talk and of Extrone himself causing him to be unhelpful as a guide.\n\nExtrone refers to being loved by his \u201csubjects\u201d suggesting he has a position of royalty or power. The military is at his disposal and seem eager to please him. He is highly focused on finding and killing a farn beast any way possible - and attempts sacrificing his guide Ri as bait for the animal to do it. He kills Mia by shooting him in the back after Ri accuses him of intent to kill Extrone, suggesting Extrone is a violent ruler.\n\nExtrone\u2019s focus is on killing a farn beast and this blinds him to the existence of an alien trap on the planet.

His guides are two businessman, Ri and Mia, who were the first to come across and kill a farn beast. They are there begrdugingly, but their fear of Extrone is clear. They arrive on the wrong side of the ridge and are searching for a way to cross it to reach the farn beasts. Ri hears the cough of a farn beast on their side, and Extrone is pleased they won\u2019t have to waste time crossing the ridge. They set up camp there, and Extrone asks Mia and Ri to scout ahead and find farn beast tracks. No one is armed, except for Extrone, so Mia and Ri are extremely cautious not to get too far into the beasts\u2019 territory. They\u2019re sweating as they come across land marred by a rocket\u2019s blast off probably from a year ago. They theorize that it\u2019s the people who discovered the beasts, though they don\u2019t know who. \nRi reveals that they shot their guide after finding the farn beast, but not their pilot. They bicker a little, scared of Extrone and the possibility of him killing them afterward. They agree to hide the blast area from him, but inform him they found tracks instead. A rocket flies over the camp, looking for Extrone. They land near and tell Extrone that an alien ship was spotted on this planet. They were unable to destroy it at the time. Extrone gives out orders to destroy it and then sends them away. Extrone asserts his dominance over Ri after they return. Ri and Mia rest in their sleeping bags, discussing what they need to do about Extrone. \nThe next morning, Extrone\u2019s personal bearer, Lin, presents alien information about the farn beasts. They begin their trek into the forest, people cutting the way for Extrone who managed to kill one small animal with his weapon. Extrone\u2019s men were able to shoot down the alien ship. Lin finds a spoor and leads Extrone to it, revealing on the way that the farn beasts are great hunters. Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to draw the beasts to him. \nWhen he informs Ri of his decision, Ri betrays Mia in a way to guarantee his safety. So, Extrone kills Mia and then uses Ri as bait anyway. After stringing him up and torturing him, his screams eventually draw the farn beast near. A farn beast and its mate appear and charge Ri. The story ends with Extrone holding fire as the farn beast nears, and the alien trap being sprung. \n",
            "General Extrone is on a hunting trip to kill a farn. To help him track the farn, he has hired two businessmen, Ri and Mia, who actually killed the first farn, which Extrone resents; he wanted to kill the first one. While Ri and Mia are out tracking the farn beast, they talk about how much they hate working for Extrone since he is a self-centered, egotist who cares nothing about anyone except himself. After Ri and Mia killed their farn, they killed their guide to keep word from getting out about it. Now they wonder if their pilot was the one who told others about it. Mia points out to Ri that Extrone might just shoot them after the hunt is over, but Ri says Extrone wouldn\u2019t do that because they aren\u2019t a couple of nobodies. Meanwhile, a low-flying rocket passes overhead and lands; it is part of Extrone\u2019s Ninth Fleet with news that an alien ship has been sighted near the planet where the general is hunting. Extrone refuses to leave with them for someplace safer, instead making it clear he expects them to take care of the problem. Ri and Mia return to camp, and Extrone has Ri give him an update. Extrone makes it clear that the two businessmen had better not have killed the last farn beast and then make Ri say he knows and loves Extrone. Later than night, Mia tells Ri he is afraid Extrone will kill them before he lets them return to civilization. Mia points out lies that Extrone has told, such as that the army tried to plot against him; Mia figured out that the army was helping him. He also thinks Extrone cut off trade with the aliens because he is getting ready to invade them. The next day, Extrone talks with his personal bearer, Lin, who has read an alien manual about the farn beast. When Extrone complains about Ri and Mia, Lin keeps telling him facts about the farn beast. Extrone allows Lin to disagree with him, but Lin always follows his statement with \u201cSir.\u201d Hunting later that day, Lin spies a spoor and shows it to Extrone. When they hear the farn cough, Lin says it\u2019s a good thing they are downwind; otherwise the farn beast would track them down. This gives Extrone the idea of using a human for bait and chooses Ri. When Ri realizes what is planned, he tells Extrone that Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone shoots Mia and still uses Ri for bait, which does lure two farn beasts. Instead of killing them, Extrone waits to see what they will do. The the aliens spring their trap.\n",
            "Ri and Mia are two businessmen hired as guides by Extrone, a violent, though popular leader, on his mission to hunt farn beasts. They were hired because of their success killing a farn beast during one of their Hunting Club missions. Soon after their arrival on the planet where the hunt takes place, Ri hears a farn beast cough while plotting their course with Extrone, and Extrone sends him and Mia into the forest to track it. Ri and Mia bemoan the fact that they have been hired for this purpose in spite of the fact that neither of them is a professional guide; they merely have hunted a farn beast in the past. As they track the beast, they discover a blast area and cannot identify the source of it, although they do know it wasn't created by one of the Hunting Club's rockets. When they make their way back to camp, they worry about if Extrone will kill them after the hunt in order to keep the discovery of the farn beasts a secret despite the fact that rumors of their existence had already spread. Extrone has killed others in the past. Back at camp, a group of high-ranking officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to warn him about the presence of a nearby alien spacecraft, fearing it is seeking him out to exterminate him. Extrone orders them to destroy it and scoffs at the idea that he might not be safe on this planet. After the officers leave, Extrone calls Ri into his tent and admits he needs him because he has never seen a farn beast and would have hunted them on alien planets (where he has heard they hunt them frequently) had it been safe for him to do so. It is clear from his conversation with Ri that Extrone is loved by his constituents and hated by his alien enemies. When Ri joins Mia later, they again discuss their fear of being killed after the hunt, and Mia suggests the army purposefully installed Extrone as puppet leader during the anti-military rebellion in order to gain popular support for their eventual attack on the alien system. Ri refuses to believe Mia's theories whether out of fear or denial; either way, Ri and Mia guides Extrone's hunt the next morning, joined by Extrone's personal bearer Lin and several other attendants. Lin warns a dismissive Extrone of the dangers of the farn beasts, and Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to lure them to their spot. In a panic, Ri tells Extrone to use Mia instead, since he had plotted to kill Extrone. Without missing a beat, Extrone kills Mia and continues to use Ri as bait. Lin and Extrone hideaway as Ri screams and draws the farn beasts to their location. Suddenly, the aliens the Ninth Fleet officers had warned Extrone about spring their trap. They had been using Extrone as bait to catch the farn beasts themselves."

It is thought by Extrone that Ri may have been one of the only humans to ever see and shoot one.\n\nThey are described as having long fangs and being carnivorous. Their main sound is a coughing noise, which can be used to locate how far away they are. They do indeed seem attracted to humans, as they are drawn to Ri screaming when he is placed as bait at the watering hole.\n\nThe farn beast is significant, because as Extrone and his party are focused on hunting them, it is revealed that the beast itself is being used as bait by aliens to lure Extrone to the planet. \n",

They are a dangerous and terrifying animal with long fangs and red beady eyes. After two businessman discovered and killed the beast on their hunting trip, it soon became the new adventure each man must attempt. The farn beasts in this story are being hunted by a party led by Extrone, an extremely powerful man. The hunt for the farn beast reveals Extrone\u2019s true colors as he kills Mia, one of his guides, and uses the other guide, Ri, as bait to kill a farn beast. The farn beasts also act as a great plot progressor and keep the characters moving forward. ",
            "The farn beast is the whole reason for the expedition in the story, and it is Extrone\u2019s obsession, so much so that he pays no attention to his army intelligence about aliens in the area near the planet where he is hunting. The farn beast is a rare creature that has only been seen by a few humans and only recently been killed by humans. They wanted to keep it a secret, so they killed their guide before returning home. Now General Extrone wants to kill a farn beast, and he is forcing the two men who killed the last one to be his guides to find one. He is angry that the two men didn\u2019t tell him about finding and killing one. The farn beast is distinguishable by its coughing roar and is known to be dangerous to humans. They are carnivorous, have long, sharp fangs, and when angered, can tear a man apart. They charge when they detect the scent, sight, or sound of prey and will track and hunt down a man even if it takes all day. After Extrone uses one of his guides as bait, two farn beasts are drawn to it. They have tiny eyes that are red and full of hatred; they swing their heads wildly and flare their nostrils in anger. Their tails thrash against the flora of the forest. When Ri screams, the farn cross the watering hole directly toward him. The story says this is when the aliens spring their trap.",
            "The farn beasts are dangerous, carnivorous creatures with small, red eyes, long, sharp fangs, and tails. Although their behavior is largely unpredictable, they are able to dismember men and aliens alike when they are angry. They also have excellent tracking skills and will pursue the scene, sight, or sound of their prey for as long as a day. Lin calls them the \"particular enemy of men\" although they are also frequently hunted by aliens. As members of the Hunting Club, Ri and Mia hunt a farn beast, and this successful kill draws the attention of Extrone, who hires them as his guides to hunt farn beasts himself. Farn beasts emit loud coughs, which is how Ri determines one of them is nearby in the first place. Later, Lin and Extrone realize there are multiple farn beasts nearby on their hunt when they hear multiple coughs. Extrone's alien enemies not only hunt the farn beasts, but they have also developed a manual for identifying and understanding them; they clearly understand the beasts much better than Extrone. This works to their advantage later as they use Extrone and Lin as bait to spring a trap to catch the farn beasts they were hunting.\n"

Extrone is pleased when people are fearful of him, but it appears that Lin may not have a fear or may be suppressing it. \n\nLin appears very loyal to Extrone, which is proven when he rejects an attempt of bribery by Ri who wants to know if he is in danger by Extrone\u2019s plan. Lin does Extrone\u2019s bidding by tying up Ri and staking him out for bait to lure the farn beast.\nHowever, when Lin and Extrone hide in a nearby tree to shoot the farn beast when they come after Ri, Lin\u2019s actions become more sinister and it is revealed that he may have different beliefs from Extrone. Lin says hunting animals should be done for reasons like survival, not just for killing - which is the opposite of what Extrone believes - that the waiting and then the killing is the appeal. It is never clear if Lin is part of the alien trapping of Extrone that results, or whether he was as blind to it as Extrone.\n",
            "Extrone is the head hunter and hotshot of this particular expedition. It seems as though he holds a monopoly over humanity through his control of the Army. Lin is his right-hand man and personal bearer. Lin is one of the few in the camp who will challenge Extrone, but not in an obvious way. He presents information to him in a way that is subtle and not demeaning, usually aided by his addition of the word \u201cSir,\u201d at the end of a sentence. Extrone respects what Lin has to say, possibly through him proving himself over and over, and even chooses not to kill him when he says something contradictory. Lin presents the manual on farn beasts to Extrone, who hates that it\u2019s developed by aliens. Lin explains how dangerous and fast these beasts are and remains calm and impassive when Extrone tries to challenge him. \nLater on, Lin discovers a spoor close to where the farn beasts are living. He races back to tell Extrone, and the two of them journey together alone. On this trip, Lin reveals that the farn beasts are excellent trackers and hunters, which inspires Extrone to set up bait for the beasts. \nIn the end, however, there seems to be a change in Lin\u2019s composure. While discussing Extrone\u2019s love for hunting, Lin claims that no one should hunt for fun, only out of necessity. He argues a little with Extrone, until the farn beasts arrive. Perhaps this signals that Lin is not as loyal to Extrone as we are led to believe. \n",
            "While the two men don\u2019t completely accept each other, they seem to be more accepting of each other than the other characters. In a position of authority, a leader cannot afford to be too friendly with those under him; however, Extrone takes this concept to the extreme and is downright hateful and hard to tolerate. The only person he is somewhat civil to is Lin, and even then, his civility is limited. Extrone treats other people in a very arrogant manner, barking orders at them (\u201cYou! Hey! Bring me a drink!\u201d), making veiled threats (\u201cIt would be a shame if you had killed the last one. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d), and treating them as if they are utterly useless. With Lin, however, Extrone allows him to respectfully disagree with him or contradict him. Extrone acknowledges that very few people will stand up to him like Lin does, and yet it may be Lin\u2019s manner of doing so that enables him to get away with this. Lin does not act afraid of Extrone, and when Extrone drones on about the way people disrespect him, Lin focuses on the topic at hand, the farn beast. When Extrone confronts him about contradicting him, Lin affects an impassive response rather than kowtowing to him. And when Lin says people should only hunt when they have to for food, Extrone says people should hunt for the love of hunting. Lin names it \u201ckilling,\u201d but Extrone corrects him with \u201chunting.\u201d Lin drops the topic as if he knows better than to debate Extrone.\n",
            "Lin has been Extrone's personal bearer for a while, having accompanied him on several expeditions such as the one on Meizque, and he does Extrone's bidding. However, he is also intelligent and clever and understands how to say the right thing to Extrone to get the reaction he wants; he appears emotionally unaffected by Extrone's bombastic behavior and is matter-of-fact in most of his actions. Lin does his best to educate Extrone about the characteristics and known behavior of the farn beasts and their potential danger to humans. Lin is practical and encourages proper precautions when they get closer to the farn beasts; he guides Extrone to the farn beasts more effectively than Ri and Mia. Lin wrangles Ri when Extrone orders him to be used as bait to catch the farn beasts. For his part, Extrone treats Lin with the same dismissiveness and condescension that he treats any of his associates. However, he does have some amount of deference for Lin and, although he does not absorb much of the information Lin tries to give him, he does listen to much of his practical advice when pursuing the farn beasts."

Mia further fears that Extrone will kill them once the hunt is over because he does not want them to reveal the location of the farn beasts. Ri's fear of Extrone takes over when Extrone wants to use him as bait to catch the farn beasts, and he throws Mia under the bus by claiming Mia has suggested assassinating Extrone. Extrone immediately kills Mia and uses Ri as bait anyway."

            "\nGabriel (Gabe) Lockard, an attractive man, is sitting in a bar with humans and extraterrestrials. He knocks over a man's drink while he talks to a girl. He offers to pay for a new suit, showing off his wealth. The other man reaches to throw his drink at Lockard but is stopped by a third man wearing a gray suit, who seems to know Lockard. This man warns Lockard to be careful, and when he leaves, Lockard tells the woman he's with that he's never seen him before, even though they talked as if they were acquaintances. The stranger visits a locker at a nearby airstation, puts most of his belongings inside, including all forms of identification, and sets the lock to the word \"bodyguard\". He climbs into a helicab, where he pressures the driver into taking him to a zarquil game. This man has been floating around without an identity, but operates as a flying dutchman, floating between zarquil games. Another day, Lockard crashes a helicar on a rainy fall night in a dark corner of a degrading city, and a fat stranger pulls him and his wife out of the helicar before it exploded. The man who saved them has the ID of Dominic Bianchi, a milgot dealer who seems to have disappeared in the past few weeks. Mrs. Lockard warns her husband to be more careful lest something happen to him. It seems the stranger's job is to rotate identities and protect Lockard. On yet another day, a thin stranger chases off a thief with his gun, and checks in on Mr. and Mrs. Lockard. Mrs. Lockard realizes that he is the same man who pulled them out of their aircar crash, and was the man wearing the gray suit at the bar. He has been changing bodies this whole time. She wants to know why, but the stranger suggests she ask Gabriel. She suspects they've been running from this stranger, and has started to be able to identify him, which the stranger is disappointed by as he explains it is not Gabriel he is helping. Because Gabriel is going to run-down cities, the bodies the stranger is getting are not well-vetted, and can't last too long. It turns out the stranger was the original Gabriel Lockard, the implication being that he's trying to protect his original body. As the stranger tries to swap bodies again, he finds that nobody wants the one he's in. He's offered a body that is healthy but likely a criminal, for three times the usual fee, and the stranger accepts the expensive deal. After the bodyswap, he recognizes the man as someone police are ordered to burn on sights. Mrs. Lockard interrogates her husband about his stolen body, which starts an argument. She recognizes he can't get his old body back, but lies and says she'd stay with him if he switched back, and the two talk about how ugly he was. ",
            "Gabriel Lockard, a good looking man, stands at the bar with his wife. He accidentally hits another man\u2019s drink, and the ugly little man winds up to hit Gabe. However, a stranger in a gray suit interjects. Gabe\u2019s wife asks who the stranger was, and he tells her that he\u2019s never seen him before. \n\nThe stranger hails a cab  and requests to be taken to the zarquil game. The cab driver tells him that he might as well commit suicide, but the stranger insists. \n\nOn a dark and rainy night, Gabe refuses to allow his wife to drive the helicar. When they crash, the stranger, with a brand new look, is right behind them. He pulls them out of the car before it blows up. Mrs. Lockard has a feeling that she has met the stranger before, but she dismisses her thought as ludicrous. When she asks for an introduction, Gabe asks the stranger for his name. He pulls out an ID card with the name Dominic Bianchi on it and explains that Bianchi lost all of his money a few weeks ago, and now he\u2019s nothing. Mrs. Lockard tries to compensate the stranger for saving their lives, but he tells her that he has plenty of money. Gabe promises to be more careful in the future.\n\nThe stranger then makes his way to the zarquil game, which is an illegal activity. The game is run by the Vinzz, and it is very expensive to play. While there, he gains a new body, and this time he has small, angular features. \n\nLater, the stranger approaches Gabe, laying on the ground in an alleyway, and his distressed wife. Mrs. Lockard recognizes the skinny stranger as the same man that has been following them and saving their lives. He admits that he is all of them, and she realizes that the stranger is playing in the zarquil games. The stranger calls a cab so that Gabe won\u2019t freeze to death outside, once again saving his life. \n\nThe stranger then goes to a zarquil game to change his appearance again. The Vinzz tries to turn him away because his body is in poor condition, but he asserts that he has lots of money to fork over. The alien offers him the body of a criminal. The stranger agrees to take the body, and he finds it to be very handsome. He recognizes the new face he wears as one that belongs to a man who will be burned immediately by any police officer he encounters. \n\nMrs. Lockard tells Gabe that she knows that the stranger who has been chasing them is the real Gabe Lockard, and he wants his body back. When the man in Lockard\u2019s body becomes defensive, she assures him that she would stay with him regardless of what his actual body looks like. He has zero interest in returning to his old body, and his wife says it\u2019s sad that he can\u2019t buy a new personality as well. \n",
            "The story takes place in a reality where humans can trade bodies through a game called zarquil, thus taking on the physical appearance of a new person while someone else gets their old body. The premise is that the body of Gabriel Lockard is actually inhabited by an unknown person. His wife, Helen, is the one to unravel the story as she begins to discover that \u201cstrangers\u201d (the real Gabe inhabiting the bodies of strangers, changing form repeatedly through the story) keep coming to their rescue. \nThe \u201cstrangers\u201d that Helen starts to realize are a single person (Gabe\u2019s consciousness) changing bodies over time appear when the arrogant and incredibly handsome body of Gabriel Lockard: gets a drink thrown in his face at a bar, crashes his vehicle into a tower with Helen as a passenger, and when he is face down unconscious in an alley. \nHelen first realizes what is happening when the \u201cstrangers\u201d seem deeply concerned that Gabe remain alive. Through their interactions, she comes to realize that Gabe is not actually in his own body, and that the real Gabe is following his body around like a bodyguard, resentful of the person in there and not wanting any harm to come to what he considers his perfect physique. \nThe stranger continues to change forms throughout the story to evade detection by Gabe, though Helen foils that plan. He also does this for the reason of wanting to inhabit a body as perfect as he believes his original body was, hoping to \u201ctrade up\u201d to a body he finds suitable through the process. The last body switch he makes is a dark deal into the body of a wanted criminal that is very handsome and fit. He is happy with the outcome as he thinks he may be able to get away with the crimes this body committed with his cunning wit.\nThe story closes with Helen confronting the body of Gabe with an unknown person inside, in which he confirms that what she knows is true. The person inside Gabe is unkind to her and does not treat her well, and the story ends with her in this predicament, having to make a choice whether to stay or go.\n",
            " In a bar with his wife, Gabriel Lockard draws attention to himself with his good looks and arrogance. Lockard gestures expansively, bumping another man and spilling his drink on his suit, knocking his glass to the floor. Condescendingly, Lockard offers to buy him another drink and pay his cleaning bill. When the man starts to throw his fresh drink on Lockard, he is stopped by a stranger in a gray suit. Lockard and the man in the gray suit talk as if they know each other; Lockard acknowledges the stranger is useful to have around, and the stranger, noticing signs of Lockard\u2019s aging, comments Lockard soon might not be worth saving. \nAfter following Lockard to his hotel, the stranger takes a cab to the zarquil games to change his body, something he does after every encounter with Lockard. In the meantime, Gabe and Mrs. Lockart go out in a helicar. When Mrs. Lockart suggests she drive because Gabe is drunk, he insists on driving. He crashes the helicar, and the stranger, now a fat man, rescues him and his wife from the helicar just before it catches on fire. Gabe introduces his wife, and the stranger mysteriously states, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be worthy of the name.\u201d He takes the Lockards back to their hotel and then goes to the zarquil games again.\nAs a slim, sickly man, the stranger rescues Lockard and his wife from a would-be thief. Lockard is unconscious while Mrs. Lockard and the stranger discuss the situation. She realizes he is the same person who keeps protecting Gabe but exchanging bodies over and over and wants to know why he does it; the stranger says she should ask her husband. He acknowledges Mrs. Lockard is in a difficult situation with her marriage, stating, \u201cToo bad he got married anyway for your sake.\u201d When Mrs. Lockard wants to know why the stranger protects Gabriel, he encourages her to ask her husband. \nWhen the stranger tries to change bodies again, he is first told his diseased body makes him ineligible but then is offered a game where all he knows is the other body is a healthy male. He suspects this means the other person is a criminal but accepts the offer anyway, knowing he will assume responsibility for the crimes the other identity had committed. The stranger ends up with a \u201cfine\u201d new body that is handsome in a dark way, but the stranger recognizes the face as someone wanted by the police.\nMrs. Lockard confronts her husband about knowing the stranger better than he claimed. She asks if he would consider taking his original body back, and Gabe states she would then be the real Gabriel Lockart\u2019s wife. She claims she would stay with her husband\u2019s soul but knows this is a lie. He claims anything would be better than the hulk of his original body; Mrs. Lockard comments it\u2019s a shame he could only change his body or his character, not both. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Her name is Helen, but she is mostly referred to as Mrs. Lockard. By the time the helicar crash happens, they have been married, and by the time they are almost robbed, they have been married six months. Her role is most clear when she is talking to the stranger after the robbery. She is the one who explicitly pieces together that the stranger she has seen, although varying in form at each event, has been the same person. The gray suit, the fat man, and the scrawny man have all been the same person. It is her perspective that changes Lockard's life and his possible path for the future, and the two of them have been on the run from the stranger the whole time they've been married. She gets enough information from the stranger to be able to confront her husband about what's happening, allowing her to uncover the whole story.",
            "\nMrs. Lockard is Gabe\u2019s wife of six months. She is a very good-looking woman with a penchant for furs. She does not realize that the Gabe Lockard she knows is not the true Gabe Lockard until she uncovers the mystery of why a shape-changing stranger is always saving their lives. Mrs. Lockard is not part of the seedy underclass, so she has little awareness of the zarquil games and would not know to be on the lookout for an intruder in her husband\u2019s body. \n\nEven before she realizes that the man she is married to is a liar, she is deeply unhappy in the marriage. At one point, the stranger who is chasing them, the real Gabe Lockard, notices that her face is bruised beneath her makeup. She is being abused by her husband, and she feels as though she has no way out of the relationship. Mrs. Lockard also complains that she has been forced to run from these strangers ever since she married Gabe. He won't tell her anything, so she is forced to figure everything out on her own, and she now recognizes that she is constantly on the run. When the real Gabe Lockard says that it\u2019s a pity that she\u2019s married, she agrees with him. \n\nThroughout her many interactions with the stranger that saves Gabe\u2019s life, Mrs. Lockard asks a lot of tough questions. She is very intelligent and continues to seek the truth even when she\u2019s being ignored. Her persistence pays off because the real Gabe Lockard admits to her that he is the same person in all of the strangers\u2019 bodies. She is then able to approach her husband with the information she has uncovered. When she tells him that she knows what\u2019s really going on, she suggests that he go back to his old body and promises to stay with him. She discovers how vain and immoral he is when he tells her that would never happen; he had the worst body before and he has zero intention of living in it again. Mrs. Lockard tells him that it\u2019s too bad he can\u2019t get a new personality. \n",
            "Helen Lockard is the wife of Gabe. She is significant because she guides the story and unravels the mysterious plot line of her husband trading bodies. She also has a significant role in attempting to enact justice upon the person that came to inhabit Gabe\u2019s body, though the reader does not see this situation fully resolved.\n\nAs the story\u2019s guide, she discovers that the strangers following her and her husband continue to rescue them from the harmful situations that Gabe places them in. She realizes the strangers are actually a single person (Gabe\u2019s consciousness) that has been taking different bodily forms by playing zarquil and following his real body around.\n\nShe often assumes Gabe is lying to her, and even considers escaping her marriage by entering a game of zarquil to become someone else. When she discovers that the body of Gabe actually has the consciousness of another person in it, she confronts them. Although she is demeaned and taunted, her motivations are set on seeking justice for Gabe.\n",
            "Mrs. Lockard is first described as \u201cthe girl\u201d with Gabriel Lockard in the bar. Gabriel is extremely good-looking and draws a lot of attention because of his looks. Compared to him, Mrs. Lockard almost looks plain. She has been married to Gabe for six months. Her husband is rude, coarse, and self-centered, and she regrets marrying him. He isn\u2019t above striking her cheek violently when they argue. For instance, Mrs. Lockard tries to get along with Gabe, gently offering to drive the helicar when Gabe has had too much to drink. After she sees the stranger at the bar, and he rescues her from the wrecked helicar, she begins to think the stranger is familiar, although he looks different each time she sees him. After the stranger saves her and Gabe from the thief, she opens up to the stranger and confesses she feels like Gabe is looking for trouble. This is also when she realizes the stranger is definitely the same person from the bar, the wreck, and now the attempted theft. She opens up to the stranger and admits that Gabe is running from something. She wonders what it would be like to change bodies with another person in a zarquil game and escape from Gabriel, but she realizes her body is a good one and would hate to give it up. She begins to realize how closely connected the stranger is to her and Gabe. She accepts the stranger, although his significance is a secret her husband keeps from her, and her acceptance spurs the stranger to admit that his current body, thin and sickly, will only last another four or five months. She later asks her husband why he doesn\u2019t give up the body, and he skeptically accuses her of wanting to be the real Gabe\u2019s wife because then her husband would be sound in mind and body. She denies thinking of herself with the real Gabe and says she would stay with her husband in his \u201creal\u201d body. When her husband admits he doesn\u2019t know where his real body is and thinks whoever has it might have killed himself after looking in the mirror, Mrs. Lockard comments that his real body must have matched his character and that it is a shame he could only change one of them, not both. Her husband realizes that she is dissatisfied with him, and her interaction with the stranger helps her see her husband as he really is. Compared to her husband, the stranger is much kinder, more honest, and stable. \n"

The stranger is keeping an eye on the current Gabriel Lockard to protect the body from harm. He does this by participating in zarquil games, run by the alien race the Vinzz, which allows him to swap bodies with other people. If he is in a reputable area, there are careful checks to make sure that these bodies are healthy, but he ends up with a sick body partway through the story, which forces him to take the body of a criminal as his only option because nobody will buy the sick body from him. The stranger's desire to protect his original body pushes him to become obsessed with this task, and it is his only real goal. He follows Lockard throughout the story, switching bodies every time he is seen, which forces Lockard and his wife to flee from him, staying constantly on the run. Lockard is used to this stranger being around, and tries to avoid making him angry, but there is a sense that he is sick of being saved and wants to live his own life. Lockard even offers to buy the stranger a drink at the beginning to try to work something out, seemingly exhausted from being followed.

His life\u2019s mission is to guard Gabe\u2019s body and get it back so that he can be himself once more. In order to do this, he follows the fake Gabe Lockard and his wife around town to make sure that he is treating his body nicely. Fake Gabe Lockard frequently gets into fights, accidents, and other situations that could lead to his death or irreparably damage his body, and the stranger spends nearly all of his waking hours keeping tabs on him and rescuing him from destruction. \n\nThe stranger seems sinister at first, especially since he goes to seedy areas of town where the Vinzz run illegal zarquil games. He uses his immense wealth to purchase other peoples\u2019 bodies. However, his motivation for continuously changing bodies is to keep his secret from the fake Gabe Lockard. He does not want the man who stole his body to be able to recognize him and kill him. Although he has not found the perfect solution to his problem, he is merely doing what he can to survive, protect his true body, and try to get it back. The stranger treats Gabe\u2019s new wife well, and he even tells her the truth about his predicament.

            "An alien race called the Vinzz, from Altair's seventh planet, run the zarquil games as a way to make money so that they can buy slaves. Through these games, humans are able to swap bodies so they can experience what it is like to live as someone else. People who participate frequently are known as flying dutchmen, and the stranger in the story is called this a few times. These games are illegal and dangerous, and you must have a lot of money to participate. In larger cities with more resources and oversight, all of the potential bodies go through a detailed vetting process to make sure that the body in question does not have any illnesses or a criminal past. When the stranger ends up with a sick body near the end of the story, his only option is to accept a body with a criminal past because nobody will accept an ill body at a reputable game. Public perception shows that society looks down on these games. The cab driver that the stranger meets explicitly says that he looks down on dutchmen, saying he hates them, and very reluctantly takes the stranger to a zarquil game because he is promised the money and he knows the stranger has a gun. It is this game that caused the original Gabriel Lockard to lose his body and identity, and it is through this game that he rotates through nameless people in order to follow the new Lockard to keep an eye on the body. \n",
            "The zarquil games are illegally run by the Vinzz, an alien race. The illegal operation has such a terrible reputation that one of the cab drivers the stranger encounters suggests that he kill himself rather than playing. The cab driver almost refuses to bring him to the games, but he sees the amount of cash the stranger is holding and agrees to do his bidding. Many people in the society know nothing about zarquil because it\u2019s an underground game that people with good reputations do not take part in. The stranger is known as a \u201cdutchman,\u201d which is a term for someone who plays zarquil all the time for the rush of it. \n\nZarquil is an interesting phenomenon because both the victim and the perpetrator are both considered guilty. The game is very expensive to play, and that\u2019s why the Vinzz spend their time running the activity for humans. The Vinzz use the money they make to return to their home planet of Vinau and purchase slaves. The aliens rarely get in trouble for hosting the games because the Vinzz live about 2,000 years, and therefore no punishment would be worthwhile. The Vinzz are not subjected to capital punishment because the humans don\u2019t know if their weapons are good enough to kill them. \n\nMales are given male bodies, and females are given female bodies. The Vinzz do not play \u201cmixed games\u201d and switch up genders, even though there is surely a market for that. Humans are also not allowed to trade bodies with aliens. The Vinzz feel that if they successfully traded a human body for an alien one, the humans would become outraged and start a war over the matter. Some seedy zarquil games include private purchases of criminal bodies. Criminals do not pass the standard testing and must be bought in secret. \n\nThe zarquil games are an important part of the story because Gabe Lockard loses his body to the stranger in one of these illegal games. The stranger, or the real Gabe Lockard, then uses zarquil to continuously change bodies to go undetected by the fake Gabe Lockard. He wants to get his real body back, and in order to do that he must not let the fake Gabe Lockard know his true identity. \n",
            "Zarquil is an extremely illegal \u201ccrime against nature\u201d sport which is akin to a game of musical chairs. Instead of trading chairs, the game is a high consequence one where humans trade bodies. Supposedly the entrants to the game have a physical health check to ensure the participants get into bodies free of disease, but this proves to not be well regulated as the stranger receives several bodies which he thinks are \u201cdiseased\u201d.\n\nThe sport is run by aliens, Vinzz, from Altair\u2019s seventh planet that have no regard for the welfare of the humans playing, only the profits. The game persists on Terra (where humans live in the story) because there is no capital punishment that can be brought upon the Vinzz, as they live over 2000 years, making prison sentences useless to discourage them from running the game.\n\nThe games are significant because they allow humans to escape their lives by changing into completely different identities. This can enable criminals to escape the law, or for a single person to follow others undetected by continuously changing appearances.\n",
            "The zarquil games are an illegal activity played by people referred to as dutchmen who go from one game to another seeking the thrills they get from it. Part of the thrill of the game was the unknown; players don\u2019t know for sure what kind of body they will end up with. The games are very expensive and are run by the Vinzz, who are strange beings from Altair\u2019s seventh planet Vinau. The Vinzz have no concerns for the humans playing their games; they are running the games strictly for the money they can make from them so that they can return to Vinau and buy many slaves. The Vinzz live for around two thousand earth years and bodies mean little to them; they care nothing about a human\u2019s body. The Vinzz are not barred from coming to Earth to run their games because the trade between the two planets is so valuable that they maintain peace. In the games, people exchange bodies. The Vinzz are supposed to vet everyone who plays to make sure their bodies are healthy, but they have been known to cut corners when profits are lagging. This explains why the stranger ends up as the sickly, thin man who only has four or five months left to live. \nThe zarquil games are significant in the story because that is how the stranger lost his body and name to the current Gabe Lockard. Apparently, the stranger drank too much too many times and played the zarquil game, losing his body and identity. He continues playing the game, changing his identity after every interaction with the current Gabe. The stranger isn\u2019t sure whether he keeps changing after interacting with the current Gabe because of his interaction or because none of the subsequent bodies feel right to him. Perhaps he just wants to one day obtain a body that is as close to perfection as his original body was. \n"

The new Lockard has some sense of who the stranger is, though he knows he will never recognize him because the stranger switches bodies frequently. The stranger is keeping an eye out on his original body, trying to protect it, with a bit of hope that he may one day get it back. They have a tenuous and superficial relationship, with the new Lockard being somewhat hesitant about the stranger's involvement in his life. The stranger makes it clear that it is not Lockard he is protecting, but just the body he is in. Through this story, the stranger keeps a man from throwing a glass in Lockard's face at a bar, pulls Lockard and his wife out of a helicar crash, and stops a robbery from happening. There is bitterness and exhaustion on both sides of this relationship, and at the beginning of the story the new Lockard tries to offer the stranger a drink so they can sort things out, but the stranger refuses and it seems he would only be appeased if he had his original body back.

The stranger used to be the real owner of Gabe Lockard's body, but he lost it in a game of zarquil. Since then, he has made it his life's mission to protect his former body from harm. When an angry man at a bar almost assaults Gabe, the stranger stops the man from hitting Gabe in the face.

However, Mrs. Lockard continues asking the stranger questions and eventually uncovers the truth. She realizes that she's married to the fake Gabe Lockard, and that he is a liar and a manipulator. ",
            "The stranger is Gabe\u2019s consciousness inhabiting the bodies of other people. Gabe left his own body in unknown circumstances, and now his body is inhabited by someone else. The relationship between them is not a shared mutual experience. The person in Gabe\u2019s body is largely indifferent to the help from the stranger and does not recognize it is the same person sharing care towards him over time. The stranger (the real Gabe) feels a mix of protectiveness for his body and a deep resentment of the new person that is inside of it.\n\nThe stranger monitors \u201cGabe\u201d closely like a bodyguard and cares deeply about his body continuing to exist, even calling a cab so it doesn\u2019t freeze to death at one point. Potentially he does this with the hope that he can one day get back into it. The stranger continues to follow and save the body of \u201cGabe\u201d while simultaneously changing physical forms through playing zarquil.

            "On the surface of the moon, the American base (Freedom 19) is headed by Major Winship, with his three men, Captain Wilkins, Captain Lawler, and Lieutenant Chandler. The Soviets of Base Garagin are conducting a seismic test to learn more about the depths of the moon. The Americans protested it, as their base is not as strongly built, but the Russians went ahead anyway. With a language barrier and poor communication, the Americans don\u2019t know when they are going to perform the test, so they stand outside in their suits waiting. After a few hours, a moonquake occurs, rippling through the surface. The quake caused a leak in their base, which Winship tries and fails to fix with a marker and a plastic sheet. He complains that the Russians did this on purpose, to try and force them off the moon, but they have three weeks of emergency air. They can try and fix it. \nThey are unable to use the transmission since there is no air in the base. Winship orders his men to find the caulking solution, but it has hardened and dried out. He orders Lawler and Chandler to make the 60-minute-round-trip journey to Base Garagin to ask for help. Though Soviet General Finogenov denies it, Winship still wonders if this was intentional. Wilkins and Winship share a meal of gross nutrition tablets. \nWilkins, the resident tech, hooks Winship up to the radio within his suit, so he can speak into the radio. With all the complicated wiring, Winship\u2019s air supply is cut off, and he motions to Wilkins to fix it. Earth is on the line, but he tries to not make his problem known. After Wilkins fixes it, Winship informs them of their difficulties and is told that a replacement could arrive in 10 days and that the Russians formally apologized. \nChandler and Lawler arrive with a 55-gallon barrel of caulking agent, along with another compound that must be mixed in. Displeased by the Russian\u2019s excessiveness, the team figures out a way to successfully mix it. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, while the rest move the barrel inside the dome with great difficulty. They mix the barrel and quickly realize that it is a chemical epoxy, one that reacts to temperature. The heat of the mixer and the dome causes the epoxy to heat up drastically. The men escape to the airlock and watch as the barrel explodes, the fire it causes using up all their remaining oxygen. \n",
            "An American man named Major Winship learns that there will be an underground blast the following day. He calls Base Gagrin, the Soviet Union\u2019s dome, to request that they relay the exact timing of the explosion. The person who answers cannot speak English, so Winship hangs up. Winship and his three crew members, Lawler, Wilkins, and Chandler, have no way of knowing when the explosion will be over because they are on the moon. Winship\u2019s suit stops working, and his body starts to overheat. Although he knows it\u2019s a risk, he decides to leave the safety of the dome so that he can cool down. He can\u2019t stand the excessive heat and thinks that the explosion has already occurred.\n\nWhen Winship immerses himself in the moon\u2019s environment, he successfully cools down. Within seconds, however, he feels the explosion. The men hear several minutes of static on their communication devices. They realize that their capsule has a dome and is losing pressure. Winship tries to cover the hole with a plastic sheet, but it doesn\u2019t work. He reenters the dome and speaks to the Soviets on the phone. Their leader lets him know that they suffered zero damage and suggests that it\u2019s because their dome is stronger and superior to the Americans\u2019. Winship accuses them of purposefully failing to communicate, and the Soviet denies it. The men attempt to use some calk to fix the hole, but it is useless because it has already been exposed to air. \n\nAlthough the Americans hate to rely on the Soviets for any type of help, the crew has no choice at this point. Lawler and Chandler take the land car to the Soviet base to get supplies to patch the hole. Winship cannot travel because of his busted suit, and Wilkins stays behind with him. They share a meal and complain about how the Soviets have a much nicer dome than they do, and their leader has a real wooden desk, among other nicer amenities. Some time later, Winship calls Earth. He tells the Americans on the ground about the leak in their dome. The man on the other end tells Winship that the Soviets have apologized for the incident, but Winship still isn\u2019t convinced of their sincerity. \n\nLawler and Chandler return with a 55-gallon drum of the calking agent, and this shocks Wilkins and Winship. They need only a very small amount, and this massive drum is difficult to carry and maneuver. Again, Winship wonders if the Soviets are playing tricks with the Americans. The team uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, but the mixture gets incredibly hot and starts turning bright red. Wilkins realizes that the compound is an epoxy, and the men need to exit the dome immediately. He yells at everyone to evacuate. The Americans are very worried that the drum of calk is going to blow up like a bomb. Moments later, it does. \n",
            "The story starts with four Americans in spacesuits on the moon waiting outside of their dome as the Russians conduct a seismic test involving some explosions. Pinov is the Russian on the emergency line, but he does not speak English, so the Americans don't know when it will be safe to enter the dome again. It was hot outside the dome, and the suits' cooling systems could only do so much. Major Winship got tired of waiting and wanted to cool off, so he entered the dome, but as soon as he did so he was thrown off his feet from an explosion. Soon after, some static blocked communications for a minute or two, but then the men had a new problem: the dome was losing pressure, so they were losing air. After their best attempt at patching the hole, they got in touch with the Russians who had not sustained any damage. Major Winship had no patience for General Finogenov, even though the Russian was seemingly embarrassed that there had been a quake caused by his test, as he had promised therew ould not be. Lt. Chandler found the squeeze tubes that they could use to patch the rupture, but they were no longer any good, so Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler headed to Base Gagarin in their land car to ask to borrow calking compound from the Russians.  Major Winship and Capt. Wilkins figured they may as well report back to Earth, but once their communications connect, Major Winship realized he is on emergency air and tries to get help from Capt. Wilkins, but those on Earth heard Winship lose air and gasp. Wilkins caught on just in time, and updated those on Earth as they swaped out their oxygen supplies in their suits. Earth requested a report in three hours, confirming that the dome's leak hadn't been repaired, and Winship was relieved the Soviet didn't have to step in to help with his air issue. When the others returned with the fifty-five gallon drum of calking compound, they marveled at how much the Soviets had on hand, and then moved to make an electric mixer to prepare the compound. They tried to move the drum inside to mix it, but there wasn't room, and they tried to move it back out, so all of the men were sweating again. As they discussed how best to proceed in patching the dome, it occured to Wilkins that it could be a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin, and just then they realized that the epoxy had become rock-solid and hot. Wilkins threw out orders to try to protect the men from the impending explosion, but he watched the drum of compound melt, and eventually the air tank started to heat up too. A quick burst of flame flashed inside the dome, leaving the men stranded without air at the end of the story. \n",
            "Major Winship and his crew stationed at the American moonbase Freedom 19 await a subterranean atomic explosion resulting from a test conducted by their Russian counterparts at Base Gagarin. According to the Russians, the test will help them determine the composition of the moon by analyzing the resultant seismic activity. However, Major Winship suspects the Russians, led by General Finogenov, are conducting the tests in order to purposefully sabotage American efforts to fortify their moon presence. They struggle to communicate with the Russian base as they await word on the status of their test, and when Major Winship goes back inside the dome to call them again, he is suddenly knocked over by movements of the moon's surface, signifying completion of the test. After the quakes settle, the crew discovers a leak in the protective dome, which causes air to slowly seep out. Luckily, they have an emergency air supply to last three weeks, but they lose a significant amount of calking that could be used to repair the leak. When a plastic sheet fails to patch the damage, Lt. Les Chandler searches for squeeze tubes that can ostensibly repair it. However, he discovers that the paste inside requires air in order to harden and some of the tubes have hardened already. Captain Skip Lawler accompanies Lt. Chandler to Base Gagarin in order to ask for calking that might help repair the patch. In their absence, Major Winship bemoans to Captain Larry Wilkins the luxury in which the Russians live on Base Gagarin compared to their discomfort in the cramped quarters of Freedom 19. He continues to muse about his theory that General Finogenov intentionally caused the explosion to harm their base and cause them to vacate the moon. As they await Lawler and Chandler's return, Capt. Wilkins calls Earth on the radio transmitter so that Winship can report the test explosion and the resulting damage. While he talks, he suddenly runs out of his emergency supply of air, and Wilkins refills it for him. Earth promises to restore their air supply in ten days. When Lawler and Chandler return with the calking compound, the crew spends a good amount of time engineering a large, mechanical mixer since the compound comes in a massive, heavy barrel and must be mixed together in order to use it properly. As Captain Wilkins begins mixing the compound, he suddenly realizes that it is a room-temperature-curing epoxy resin. The resin hardens, and the crew rushes out of the dome just before it melts, tips over the barrel, and ignites the air tank next to it, causing a massive explosion. Now the crew is left without any supply of air, and their only hope is an emergency supply still ten days from arriving."

            "As can be seen from the beginning, Base Gagarin and the small group of Americans have a slightly contentious relationship. Even the title of the story, The Winning of the Moon, emphasizes the undercurrent of war and competition that informs the way they interact with each other. \nThe story begins with potentially purposeful miscommunication between the Russians and the Americans. The Soviet base is running an underground seismic wave test, the likes of which could release after-shocks and tremors. Such a quake could damage the American dome, meager in comparison with Base Gagarin. The Soviets put Pinov on the line, who only speaks Russian. Without the ability to communicate, the Americans were stuck outside on the moon for hours, waiting to see if the seismic eruption could be seen or felt. Feeling like idiots, one goes inside, just as an aftershock causes a leak in their dome. They instantly blame the Russians, especially since the Americans protested such a test. \nThis series of unfortunate events continues as the Americans quickly realize that their supplies are not able to fix the leak. They must ask the Russians for help, even after complaining to their home base about their actions. \nBase Gagarin is huge compared to the American dome. General Finogenov even has a wooden desk in his office, along with other earthly amenities that the Americans have been deprived of. The Russians have been on the moon for six years longer than the Americans, which could explain their extensive supplies. \nThey give the Americans a 55-gallon mixture to fix the leak, however, the language barrier prevents them from realizing what kind of epoxy it is. This miscommunication leads to the barrel exploding and further destroying the American dome. It\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s not smooth sailing on the moon. \n",
            "When Winship calls the Soviets to discuss the exact timing for the underground explosion, Pinov, the person who answers the call, cannot speak English. This makes Winship frustrated. When Captain Wilkins suggests to Captain Winship that he say the word \u201chelp\u201d into the phone so that the Soviets will know it\u2019s serious, Winship says he would rather die. This suggests that there\u2019s a power dynamic between the two nations, and Winship, as an American, does not want to appear weak in front of the Soviets. Winship wants to keep his American crew safe, but his pride is equally important at this point. As a result of Winship\u2019s refusal to say the word \u201chelp,\u201d he ends up stepping outside of the dome before the explosion occurs. \n\nLater, Winship called General Finogenov, the Soviet leader, to report some damage to their dome. The General responds by explaining that the Soviets have a stronger dome, and Winship accuses Finogenov of deliberately cutting the ties of communication to keep the Americans guessing and jeopardize their safety. Finogenov profusely denies Winship\u2019s claim and offers to help in any way possible. \n\nWinship is highly suspicious of the Soviets, and especially suspicious of Finogenov\u2019s incredible working space in the dome. He has a wooden desk, a chair, and one hundred square feet to move around in. It appears to Winshp that Finogenov cares only about his own comfort and not about the safety of his American counterparts. When Winship has to call the Americans on Earth to let them know about the air leak, he is concerned that the Soviets are listening in on his call. He and his men do not want to wait 10 days for the other Americans to send them supplies to fix the leak, so their only real choice is to rely on the kindness of the Soviets. This makes Winship sick to his stomach, as he loathes asking them for help and potentially looking weak. \n\nIt appears that Winship\u2019s suspicions are merited when the Soviets send over a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix a very small leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, and they do not give the Americans proper instructions for how to prepare and use the chemicals. The crew uses an electric mixer to prepare the calk, and the epoxy mixture turns bright red and blows up. \n",
            "There are seven Soviets and four Americans on the moon in this story, and there is definitely an issue of a balance of power. The Soviets have been there for six years longer than the Americans have, and have way more space set up for their equipment and living. The Americans operate out of one 500 square foot dome, and the Soviets have a 3000 square foot dome and two smaller ones (that are each still larger than the American one). The Americans think they have better space suits, that are at least less bulky, but don't have the amenities like the nice furniture or the fresh plants. Things are very tense over the radio: Major Winship seems constantly angry while communicating with the Soviets, and the Russians act polite and apologetic when things go terribly wrong, even if it's unclear how much happened on purpose. On the day of the seismic test, the one Soviet who does not speak English is the one who is in charge of emergency communication, which Winship thinks was on purpose. The Soviets have a lot more electric power, and say that their experiments are all for purely scientific purposes, even if the Americans think the Soviets are trying to drive them out. The Americans have to rely on the Soviets for emergency supplies; they hope not to have to ask for air, but do retrieve a drum of calking compound to aid in the dome repairs which eventually causes an even larger problem as their air supply is burnt out. ",
            "Although the two groups both operate bases on the moon, they live very different lives and struggle to effectively communicate with each other. While one large dome and three smaller ones comprise the Soviet Base Gagarin, the American Freedom 19 base is one cramped dome where the four-person crew lives and works.  The seven-person crew at Base Gagarin live in luxury compared to the American crew and have hot tea, better supplies, and more space to live and work. Major Winship expresses consistent frustration with the inability to communicate with Pinov during the atomic test, and he is deeply suspicious about General Finogenov's motives regarding the test in the first place. Winship does not trust when Finogenov insists the tests are being conducted for purely scientific purposes, and the results of the study will be made available in the technical press. For his part, Finogenov is deeply apologetic when the test causes a leak in Freedom 19 and therefore a drop in air pressure, but Winship still doesn't trust him. He believes it is all part of a Soviet plan to sabotage their mission and expel them from the moon. Winship's misgivings appear to have some truth (or else the whole incident reveals the incompetence of the American crew) when the Soviet base supplies the Americans a large batch of what they believe to be a calking compound in order to repair the air leak. The compound turns out to be a highly explosive material that combusts when it makes contact with the American air tank, thus completely depleting its air supply."

It is cramped inside, filled to the brim with equipment, tools, and supplies necessary for the moon. The American men slept on bunks that rose up from the floor. Cables hung from the ceiling and snaked across the walls, bringing energy into the dome using solar power. The base itself is in the shape of a dome with an airlock leading to the outside. \nThe Russian base, Base Gagarin, is incredibly different. They\u2019ve got three buildings that make up the base, the biggest of which is 3,000 square feet. With luxuries like wooden furniture, fresh lemons from Earth, and nutmeg, the Soviet base has everything the Americans lacked. \n",
            "\u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d takes place on Earth\u2019s moon, where both the Americans and the Soviets have built domes that house crews for years at a time. There is no oxygen on the moon\u2019s surface, so it\u2019s very important that the crew members have strong suits with plenty of emergency air canisters. In this story, the Soviets\u2019 explosion creates a leak in the Americans\u2019 dome, which poses a major problem. The Americans housed in the dome will die if they cannot fix the leak in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThe Americans\u2019 dome is small and cramped. There is a ton of necessary equipment, and not a lot of room to move around for the four crew members. The men sleep in bunk beds. The Soviets\u2019 dome, however, is much nicer and roomier. Their home is called Base Gagarin, and it\u2019s located about 10 miles away from the Americans. It is much sturdier, and as a result, it does not spring a leak after the purposeful detonation is over with. The Soviet General has a real wooden desk in his office and a real wooden chair, and the norm is to use aluminum furniture.

The dome that the Americans live and work in is very small, only 500 square feet, but the Soviets have one large dome and two smaller ones which gives them much more space. It is hot on the surface of the moon in the space suits, so the Americans have to be inside the dome to be able to cool off. ",
            "The story takes place at Freedom 19, an American moonbase. An airlock leads into a five hundred square foot dome on the surface of the moon filled with various kinds of equipment, a table, an air tank, and radio transmitter. The dome is powered by solar cells affixed to the roof. The compact living space includes bunks attached to the walls six feet above the floor. Ten miles from Freedom 19 rests Base Gagarin, the Russian moonbase situated at the bottom of a fold in the moon's surface. The Americans travel to and from Base Gagarin in a small land car for supply runs and meetings. Compared to the cozy quarters of the American base, the Russian base is large and comfortable with three domes instead of one. The main dome has more than three thousand square feet and the smaller two are twelve hundred square feet each. Finogenev's office is one-hundred square feet with a wooden desk and chair. Major Winship envies the comfort in which the Russians live on their base and mentions the presence of a samovar, which they use to boil and dispense hot tea. Winship also believes the Russians chose their heavy, wooden furniture to taunt the Americans since they have access to vast amounts of aluminum and choose wood construction instead. "

This leak is significant because it is the first of a series of slightly cataclysmic events. As well, it highlights the strained and tense relationship between the Russians and the Americans. \nMajor Winship accused the Russians of deliberately injuring their base, further showing how contentious their relationship is. General Finogenov ardently denies this, however, and says that their base had no damage at all. \nAfter trying and failing to fix the leak with their own supplies, two of the Americans are forced to travel to Base Gagarin and borrow their resin. This ends up backfiring, however, as the epoxy quickly heats up and explodes as they mix the two components together. The explosion further damages the dome and takes away the American\u2019s entire air supply. \nAs well, the seismic testing was greatly discouraged and protested by the Americans. \n",
            "The four man American crew on the moon is warned about the Soviets\u2019 underground atomic device and its planned detonation before the test is completed. The Soviets have planned the explosion in order to learn more about the composition of the moon. The shock waves from the explosion should give them information about the various layers of the moon. The Americans protested the underground explosion because they feared that the device\u2019s detonation would disturb their satellite. Although the Americans call their Soviet counterparts to get information about the exact timing of the explosion, the person who answers the phone cannot speak English, so they are unable to learn the Soviets\u2019 specific plans. Major Winship is outside of the American dome when the device is detonated, which is strictly against protocol. The Americans prove that they were right to fight the Soviets about their plan because the dome they live in gets a leak from the shifting surface of the moon. The Soviet General apologizes for the lack of communication and the damage to the Americans\u2019 dome, but their behavior still reads as suspicious. ",
            "The Soviet Union had conducted a seismic test on the moon by detonating an underground atomic device, but the Americans had warned the Soviets that they shouldn't go through with the tests because of potential dangers. Even though the Americans asked the Soviets not to run the test, they did anyway, and the resulting tremors ruptured the American dome. Not only was the dome leaking air because of this test, but the Americans had to rely on the Soviets for supplies to try to fix it. This only made matters worse, because the materials the Americans borrowed from the Soviets to repair the dome ended up burning out their entire oxygen supply, leaving them stranded without air at the end of the story. In this way, the seismic test shows both the power the Soviets think they hold over the Americans as well as a chance for the Americans to lose emergency supplies as their situation rapidly falls downhill.  ",
            "The Russians claim to conduct the seismic test in order to analyze the resultant shock waves to help them better understand the composition of the moon where they and the American have established bases. Although they insist their purpose is purely scientific, Major Winship suspects they intended the test to harm Freedom 19. The test triggers a few moonquakes, which ultimately causes a leak to appear in the dome. The resulting loss in air pressure leads the crew of the Freedom 19 to attempt a variety of methods to patch the leak. However, they have subpar materials and tools to work with compared with the plentiful resource at Base Gagarin. Lawler and Chandler make their way to the Russian base in order to procure calking that may seal the leak. They return with the calking compound which turns out to be a highly combustible material, which explodes and eliminates the rest of their air supply."

            "Major Winship is one of the few Americans who is currently living on base on the surface of the moon. He is in charge as the Commanding Officer of Freedom 19, as he outranks both the Captains and the first Lieutenant. After watching the moonquake shake the surface from inside the base, Major Winship quickly realizes that the quake ripped a hole in the dome itself. He attempts to fix it with a marker, then with a plastic sheet, but both fail. Their caulking compound has hardened and is completely unusable. Winship accuses the Russians of causing the quake and leak on purpose, but the General vehemently denies his claims. They try to call into Earth but realize that without air, there\u2019d be no sound. So, they have to find another way.  \nStuck in his suit until they can restore air to the base, Winship sends Lt. Chandler and Capt. Lawler to ask the Soviets for help. Winship shares a meal with Wilkins, and then the Captain connected to Winship with a series of wires to the radio. This way he\u2019d be able to communicate while in his suit. \nHe suffers a major mistake with the wiring, however, when his air supply is cut off. He motions to Wilkins who saves him, reconnecting the lost cable, and Winship lets those on Earth know what happened. They let him know that they\u2019ve received a formal apology and that they will send a replacement in ten days\u2019 time. \nOnce Chandler and Lawler return, Winship is faced with a new problem: how to mix and activate the 55-gallon fix for the leak. Wilkins creates an electric mixer, and they bring the barrel inside to mix. The barrel becomes red-hot and looks to be on the verge of combustion. The men scramble and get to the airlock. The barrel explodes and the flames use up all the oxygen. Winship is faced with an even greater problem now: how to survive. \n",
            "Major Winship is the main character in \u201cThe Winning of the Moon\u201d, and he faces external and internal conflicts throughout the story. At the beginning of the story, Winship\u2019s spacesuit malfunctions, and the technology that keeps him cool stops working. He begins sweating profusely, and it deeply annoys him. He wants information about the Soviets\u2019 planned explosion, but he cannot learn the timing of the explosion because the person he speaks to at the Soviet base does not speak English. This further frustrates Winship, and he begins to believe that the Soviets are making the Americans\u2019 lives difficult on purpose. He decides to take a risk and exit the dome even though he can\u2019t be totally sure that the device was already detonated. He goes outside to cool himself off, and within moments he feels the ground quaking. When he discovers a leak in the dome, he tries unsuccessfully to patch it up with plastic sheeting. The last thing he wants to do is ask the Soviets for help, so he becomes even more irritated when he learns that the calk the Americans have on hand is busted and will not work to fix the leak.Two of his team members head to the Soviet base to get supplies to fix the leak, but Winship stays behind with his malfunctioning suit. He decides to call Earth to discuss the Soviets\u2019 actions, and while he is on the phone, he realizes that he is using his emergency air supply. He has to motion silently to his colleague, Wilkins, to help him out so that he can breathe. Winship is very frustrated when Lawler and Chandler return to the American base with a 55-gallon drum of calk to fix the small leak, and he once again questions the Soviets\u2019 actions. He has to quickly exit the dome along with the other crew members before the drum explodes after they attempt to ready the concoction for use with an electric mixer. ",
            "Major Winship is the commanding officer of the mission Freedom 19, the American base on the moon. He runs communications with the Russians who are also on the moon, and is trying to requet information from Pinov, who does not speak English, at the beginning of the story. He is upset with the Russians and does not like them very much, and he thinks they are deliberately making communication difficult. His reefer isn't working and he's boiling in his suit so he insists on going back into the dome to cool off, when he is knocked over by the quake from a seismic test the Russians are doing. He has a spat on the radio with the Russians and complains about the situation as the Americans try to patch the dome. While Capt. Lawler and Lt. Chandler head to the base for supplies, he stays behind in the dome, reflecting on how the American space suits are better than those of the Russians, as he yearns to be able to smoke. After the men return with a drum of calking compound, Winship continues discussing his suspicions that the Soviets ran the test to cause damage to the American base on purpose. After they try to mix the drum indoors, he realizes they have to move it back outside, but soon everything goes wrong. The drum heats up, heating up the air tank in turn, and a flame shoots through the dome, burning through the entire American oxygen supply.",
            "Major Winship is the commander of the four-person crew of the Freedom 19. Suspicious and cynical, Winship envies the luxury in which the crew at Base Gagarin lives. His bitterness manifests in his interactions with everyone from the Russian crew; he grows frustrated and impatient when Pinov cannot speak English. He suspects General Finogenov is lying about the purpose of the atomic test and believes he wants to eliminate the American base from the moon entirely. Winship orders his crew through a series of failed repairs using their inferior resources after the atomic test results in an air leak in the Freedom 19 dome. During his call to Earth to report the explosion damage, he thinks he is dying when his emergency air supply runs out, but Wilkins quickly replaces it. Winship's growing frustration reaches its crescendo when Lawler and Chandler return from their supply run, and the five-person crew struggles to maneuver the large container into the small dome and then further struggle to build a makeshift mixer which with to stir the calking compound.

She rides on her horse Ninc for three days before she comes across other people. The men and Mia get into a disagreement because she does not want to join them. Mia proceeds to point her weapon and them. She tells them to drop their rifles on the ground and only lets them return to retrieve them once Mia and the men are a 20-minute ride away from the weapons. \n\nMia continues on riding her horse and passes a town where she meets more people. Eventually, Mia ends up at a campsite where she intends to rest and eat. However, the men who she encountered before and flashed her weapon at, find her at the campsite. She is grabbed from behind. The men have their grip on her, preventing her from escaping from them. The men destroy her pickup signal and she is punched in the face by one of the men. \n",
            "First we see the main character, Mia, in a scoutship, where she and another fifteen girls and thirteen boys are being sent to the planet Tintera for their Trial. All of the inhabitants at the age of fourteen will be send to the Trial where they have to survive thirty days on a colonized planet. Those make to the end and are brought back by the ship are considered as useful to the society while those that cannot make it are not. \n\nMia spends the first night by her own after declining Jimmy Dentremont\u2019s invitation, a boy who is also on the Trial, to become partners, and avoiding Venie Morlock, a girl on Trial and has a crush on Jimmy Dentremont. Finally on the third day, Mia goes on the road, travelling east with her horse, Ninc. She meets Horst and his group of men. After they threaten her to go along with them, she pulls out her gun before they do. So she tells them to drop their weapons and walk along with her. Later she lets them go back to retrieve their guns. Afterwards, she gets to a village where she is shocked again. Here she sees the Free Birthers who destroyed Earth. But apparently, they seem to have forgotten what horrifying things they have done to Earth, to mankind. Then later, Mia sees the scoutship again, but the driver is not one of theirs, which is weird.\n\nAs she gets to a campsite, she pulls herself in. There she sees a family with three kids. They have a campfire and tell bedtime stories. Not long after, Horst and his group get here as well. Mia tries to escape, but she can\u2019t and is caught by Horst. She tries to use her gun again when they take her pickup signal, but this time she gets caught and is knocked unconscious. ",
            "Mia Havero is a fourteen year old girl who lives on a spaceship home to a human civilization. She, along with twenty eight other young adults are about to be dropped off on a colonized planet Tintera, where they will undergo their Trial. Members of the Ship\u2019s population, upon turning fourteen, are dropped off on a planet with a horse, food and clothes, a pistol, and a pickup signal so that they may be picked up a month later, forced to survive on their wits and skills. \n\tJimmy Dentremont, one of the children about to be dropped off whom Mia considers to be of similar intelligence as herself, approaches her and asks if she wants to partner up during the trial. She teasingly refuses, and Jimmy disembarks the ship to begin his trial. Mia is dropped off at another location with her horse Ninc, and we learn of her dislike for planets: she is unaccustomed to the gravity, the fauna, and the smell.  \n\tOn her third day of riding, Mia discovers a road and five men herding grotesque green creatures. As she catches up with them, she notices that they are armed. Their leader, who she judges to have a mean face, invites her to ride with them to Forton. When she refuses, he gestures towards his rifle; however, she quickly draws her sonic pistol and forces the men to disarm. Twenty minutes of riding later, she leaves the men, allowing them to return for their weapons. \n\tMia enters a town whereupon she encounters a family with four children and realizes that the population of the planet engage in unregulated reproduction. She is disgusted by this behaviour, remembering that it was such behaviour that led to the overpopulation of Earth and the need to evacuate onto the Great Ships. Overhead, she notices a scout ship, similar to the one that dropped her off on Tintera, and wonders what it is doing there. \n\tNow at a campsite, Mia rests and observes the interaction between an old man and a family with three children. He tells the children the tale of Baba Yaga, an evil witch who lived in a house that stood on chicken legs. Baba Yaga\u2019s stepdaughter is sent to live with her, and foils her stepmother\u2019s attempt to get rid of her. \n\tSuddenly, Mia notices commotion at the edge of the camp, and realizes that the five men whom she held at gunpoint earlier had arrived. As she makes to leave, one of the men pins her and calls over the others. He tells Mia that it is obvious she is from a Ship, and that one of her friends was imprisoned in Forton. Mia quickly levels her gun at him, asking for the name of her friend. As he stalls, she is struck by another one of the men, and her pickup signal is destroyed shortly before she is knocked out.\n",
            "Mia is a fourteen year old girl aboard Earth's ship after the planet's evacuation. When all children on the ship turn fourteen, they go through the Trial, where they are dropped on a random colonized planet and told to survive on their own for a month. Mia is waiting to be dropped on Tintera, a planet that has had little to no contact with the ship for over a century. She is accompanied by other children that she has known, some friends, most of them she is indifferent about. Once Mia is dropped onto Tintera along with her horse Ninc, she gets through the first night feeling frightened and lonely. For the next few days, she roams the planet in search of people to stick with. As she explores, she notes that Tintera is home to odd animals. Mia eventually finds a road and travels down it, meeting a group of men on horseback. The men question Mia, calling her a boy, and insist that she join them. Mia declines, to which the men draw their weapons at her. However, she raises her sonic pistol at them and is able to get away. Mia continues until she reaches a town, where she discovers that the people there are Free Birthers: people who were blamed for Earth's downfall and have multiple children. Mia is shocked by this, determined to find out more about the planet. Later that night, she comes across a campsite where she decides to turn in. She is surrounded by families and an old man who tells a story by the campfire about Baba Yaga, a wicked stepmother who sends her stepdaughter on a dangerous quest into the woods. As bedtime approaches, the men on horseback from earlier return, where they find Mia and attack her, robbing her of her gear and horse. Mia insults the men and is then knocked out."

            "Mia is taught that those who destroyed Earth were not smart and that they deserve punishment for their actions. According to her, Earth was evacuated because of overpopulation. People had too many children that required more resources than Earth was capable of providing. Consequently, there was a fight over the remaining resources that caused a war. \n\nMia has great-great-grandparents that were among those who anticipated the destruction of Earth and prepared to leave. \n\nIn addition, Mia talks about how humans left Earth. She says there were Great Ships built around 2025. The Great Ships and other things went into the Solar System in 2041. The humans that escaped established 112 colonies in the first 16 years. During this retelling of what she was taught, she emphasizes that horses were important to the success of the new colonies. \n",
            "Mia knows that there was a evac plan on Earth long ago, the evac plan needed to be implemented and colonies had to be established in a very short amount of time. In 2025, first of the eight Great Ships was finished. Then before 2041, 112 colonies were created. Mia believes that bringing horses to the colonies was an important factor that lead to the success of those colonies. Even those few planets could have had substitutes for horses, they had to be domesticated and trained. \n\nLater we acknowledge that Mia has learned about the Free Birthers in school. They destroyed Earth. Those Free Birthers basically just bred and spread, and the population on earth reached 8 billion. With so many people, resources became limited, which in the end lead to the war that destroyed Earth, and 8 billion people died along with the blow up of the Solar System. Thus, without those Free Birthers, there would never be 8 billion people on Earth, then the evac plan would never take place, and those 8 billion people would not have to die. If his great-great-grandparents did not have the foresight he did, Mia might not even be alive. ",
            "Mia is taught that, ultimately, Earth\u2019s destruction is attributable to Free Birthers, those who have an unregulated number of children. Because of the resulting overpopulation, the resources of Earth were consumed and contested, resulting in the death of eight billion people and the final war which tore apart the solar system in 2041. The first of the Great Ships, like the one on which Mia lives, was built sixteen years prior, and, in the intervening years, 112 colonies had been established. \n",
            "Mia was taught, along with all young students, that Earth was destroyed due to an overpopulation problem. \"Free Birthers\" are to blame for the destruction of Earth; these are people that had multiple children, and according to what Mia was taught, used up all the limited resources that Earth had. By a certain point, Earth had become too overcrowded, with over eight billion people as a population. This ultimately led to a final war, and an evacuation."

When Mia sees individuals with more than one child, she becomes nauseous at the sight. To Mia, that seems reckless to have so many children as she is taught that it was the cause of Earth\u2019s destruction. Another occurrence that Mia finds interesting is when she sees an old man during her travels. She is fascinated by his white hair, which she notes that she had never seen in person before. ",
            "Firstly, the planet Tintera has not been in contact with the Ship for almost 150 years. For the first two days in her Trial she sees nothing except some odd looking animals. To her surprise, they actually taste good, while some other good looking things do not taste so good. She also notices the ugly animals that Horst and his men are herding. Secondly, the town shocks her. Everything there are out of date. The truck she saw is the most advanced machine they have. The newspaper at the rear of the town has \u201cinvasion\u201d printed on them. There are literally no women older than 10 years old, only men, boys and kids. She feels weird.

Though there is a relatively small space on her ship on the third level which bear semblance to planets, it is different from Tintera in that Mia is able to leave when she feels uncomfortable. \n\tAdditionally, Tintera\u2019s human culture is different from on the ship. Whereas the inhabitants of the ship are bound by a culture which prohibits unregulated reproduction, the people of Tintera are Free Birthers unconcerned with such matters.

The seasons are also different; despite it being December on the ship, it is spring on Tintera. The planet also has animals that Mia is not used to seeing; for example, the strange creatures that she sees being herded by the men on horseback. The biggest difference that Mia notes about Tintera is that here, people have multiple children who roam about freely. This goes against the rules of the Council and frightens Mia. "

Each of the fourteen-year-olds are dropped off in separate locations on the planet. They are given a pick signal device so the scoutship that escorted them to the planet is able to locate them at the end of their 30-day Trial period. \n\nThe purpose of the trial according to the Chairman of the Council is because a closed society needs a way to ensure the physical and mental of its populations. In addition, it helps to maintain a suitable number of individuals in the population. Those that are unable to survive their Trial are presumed to be not fit for life on the Ship.  \n",

Simply stated, they will be dropped at a colonized planet that is the nearest to them for a month, and for this whole thirty days, the inhabitants will try to keep themselves alive. They can do this on their own, with partners, or join forces. Each of the inhabitants is provided with a sonic pistol, pickup signal, saddle, cinches, food and clothes. One month later, the Ship will come back to get them according to their pickup signal.

For her trial, Mia is left on the planet Tintera with her horse, Ninc, food and clothes, and a pickup signal.\n\tThe rationale behind the trial, as Mia presents it, is to screen for those inhabitants of the ship able to take care of themselves. Those who are unable to look after themselves and thereby fail the trial are not sufficiently prepared for life on the Ship. Additionally, Mia\u2019s father, the chairman of the council of the ship, tells her that it is to prevent its population from decaying mentally and physically, as well as to maintain the population. \n",

The Ship's reasoning behind this is to ensure that every individual is able to take care of themselves and be properly skilled.

Mia analyzes his face and decides that she does not want to interact with him because his face looks mean. \n\nHorst, incorrectly, assumes Mia is a boy and asks her questions. Horst asserts that Mia will ride along with the men to the town of Forton. However, Mia disagrees with that statement and Horst does not like the response. Horst begins to bring out his rifle, but Mia grabs her sonic pistol before he is able to do so. She holds them at gunpoint until they drop their weapons. \n\nAfter this confrontation, Horst and Mia do not see each other again until they both end up at the same campsite. At the campsite, Horst and his companions bind Mia\u2019s arms together to prevent her from escaping them. They look through her stuff and threaten her. \n",

Horst seems to be middle-aged and he is large with a mean looking face. When Mia ride passes him, she wanted to continue going since she thought he is mean. But he follows and asks her where she is from and going. He wants her to ride with them for protection, but Mia refuses. Interestingly, he thinks Mia is a boy. Before Horst could pull out his gun, Mia pulls out her gun first. She tells them to leave their weapons and ride along, which they did surprisingly. After a while, she tells them they can go back to gather their weapons. She finds this quite amusing. \n\nMia never thought of meeting Horst again. But as she is about to stay at a campsite for the night, she heard Horst and his group of men\u2019s voice. She tries to run, but gets caught by one of Horst\u2019s man. She tries to scream for help, but before she could do so, her mouth gets covered by Horst. Mia still has the gun with her, so she threatens Horst to hand her the pickup signal since this is her only way of getting contact with the Ship when they are to be brought back. After he handed it to her, she asks for the name of the kid in jail. But before she could get an answer, she gets hit and lost her gun. Horst has the pickup signal now. He smashes it until it fells apart. Then after calling him a \u201cbig louse\u201d she is knocked out. ",
            "Horst is a man whom Mia meets on her third day on Tintera. He wields a gun which he keeps in his saddle boots, and is roughly the age of Mia\u2019s father. Mia describes his face as mean-looking, from which she surmises that he is mean. He and his team of four others are tasked with herding a group of ugly green creatures with squat figures and lanky limbs. \nOn his first encounter with Mia, he mistakes her for a boy and encourages her to join his team on the ride to Forton. However, when she refuses, he reaches for his gun before Mia quickly unholsters her weapon and aims it at him. She holds him and his team at gunpoint, forcing them to disarm, and makes them ride with her for twenty minutes before letting them go. \nLater, Mia is at a camp when she notices the arrival of Horst and his team. One of them recognizes her and signals Horst over. As she fights with this other man, Horst subdues her and threatens to harm her. As the other man beats Mia, Horst intervenes and tells him to stop, asserting his leadership of the group. Mia threatens to report Horst to the courts, which causes him to laugh and point out that she is obviously not from Tintera. As Horst is distracted with one of the other men, Mia pulls her gun on him and asks him a question. As he stalls, another man strikes her, and Horst quickly renders her unconscious. \n",

Horst has violent intentions with Mia; he initially offers to take her along with the team of men for protection, but upon Mia's refusal, threatens her with his rifle. Mia is able to intimidate him with her own weapons, but later that night the men return by the campfire, where Mia is attacked by Horst and robbed. Mia initially only dislikes Horst, because of his mean aura and the fact that he refers to her as a boy; however, as Horst's violence is demonstrated more throughout the story, she becomes fearful of him, though still determined to stand up to him."

            "The story starts with four of the species of the spectrum of human development together, talking and explaining about the possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum to Taphetta the Ribboneer. Emmer is an archeologist and he sits on one end of the spectrum. Halden, the biologist is from Earth, he is somewhat towards the middle on the spectrum. Meredith is a linguist, and she is further down the spectrum. And Kelburn, the mathematician, is at the far end of it. They explain to Taphetta about the theory of ability to mate with humans that are on planets that are close to each other. However, due to movement of planets, they are no longer close to each other. But with some accurate calculations, if all the stars were to go back two hundred thousand years, the position of those stars line up in the shape of a horse shoe. And they theorize that their original home lands on where the extension of the two ends of the horse shoe cross over. And the four explorers believe they have a chance of finding their original home. They are explaining this to Taphetta because they need him to be the pilot of this expedition. \n\nAfter Taphetta suggests that he does not like the air in the ship, they realize that some animals hs been eating the plants. With failing attempts to capture them, the biologist suggest that their mental and physical state might have changed due to radiation or atomic engines. Thus they set up a play for the animal to watch so that they will get into the trap. \n\nMeredith and Halden get into a fight because Meredith thinks Halden as primitive, and Halden does not like that. When he realizes that Meredith somehow knows she can\u2019t be fertile with Kelburn, he gets so angry that he hits her nose. Then he come to realize why Meredith will not want to marry him and have children with him, even he would want superior children.",
            "The story begins with Taphetta discussing with Sam Halden, the leader of the expedition, Sam\u2019s theory on the origins of humans. They talk about different species and their abilities to mate with other species depending on how closely related the species are physical. They attempt to persuade Taphetta to pilot the ship by arguing that their theory is sound in logic and could lead to a great discovery. Taphetta is skeptical of their assertions for the origins of humans. Kelburn continues to explain in an attempt to convince him to navigate their ship.\n\nEventually, Taphetta agrees to navigate their ship as long as they sign his contract. The group does sign his contract as they desperately need his skills to complete their expedition. Halden trusts that his contract will not be deceitful. Once he has agreed, the group discusses Taphetta\u2019s need for better oxygen on the ship. During this discussion, it is brought to Halden\u2019s attention that there is an unknown pest on board the ship, an animal. \n\nEmmer talks to Taphetta about how every human race has achieved space travel at some point in their existence. Taphetta questions what they hope to achieve from their expedition, assuming that there will be money and technology to gain from the mission. Emmer and Halden argue that the examination of their culture and the drive of curiosity are their motivations for the mission. \n\nAt some point, the animals on the ship engage in a fight with a knife. After, Meredith and Halden begin conversing about their potential relationship. Halden leads Meredith to his cabin where he instinctively punches her nose after she has made him upset. They exchange words of admiration and lust for each other. Halden primitively kisses Meredith with passion.\n",
            "Sam Halden, a biologist from a world where humans have developed to the early-middle section of their evolution, is in conversation with Taphetta, an individual of the non-human species Ribboneers, so named because of the ribbons protruding from his head. Halden explains to Taphetta that there are hundreds of independently-evolved human species on just as many worlds, each at various stages of human development. The crew of Halden\u2019s expedition, humans from the various human-inhabited worlds, represents the range of human development: Emmer is a Neanderthal-type archeologist who represents early humanity, Halden is an early-middle human, Meredith is a linguist from an advanced-middle human society, and Kelburn is a mathematician from the far advanced side of human evolution. \nTaphetta, himself from an advanced civilization, is initially uninterested in Halden\u2019s theories of human evolution. However, as Kelburn elaborates on the adjacency mating principle, an observation supporting the humans\u2019 hypothesis of a common ancestor which distributed humans throughout the galaxy, he becomes interested. Taphetta accepts the humans\u2019 invitation to be their pilot for the expedition, on the condition that they use his contract. \n\tAn engineer from the ship\u2019s hydroponics department, which is responsible for regulation of the ship\u2019s air, reports to Meredith, who is physically attractive and wearing a revealing skirt, that Taphetta is not fond of the air. Halden learns that the air quality in the ship has been suffering due to damage to the plants caused by an animal. Despite the engineer\u2019s efforts, the animal is resistant to pesticides and is intelligent enough to avoid the electric traps. They resolve to bait it into a trap. \n\tHalden approaches the ribboneer to inform him of the infestation. As he considers using the bait, Taphetta asks Emmer about the archeological evidence of their common ancestor on his home planet. The Neanderthal reveals that relics of massive proportions indicate the size of the common ancestor, and that they were likely long-lived and able to travel faster than light. Halden hypothesizes that their ancestor was unable to find a suitable planet, so instead left modified versions of themselves on each planet they visited. Taphetta is further interested by the theory of the common ancestry and finally acquiesces to using a bait to trap the pest. He also reveals that the terms of the contract upon which he insisted prohibits that information discovered during the expedition be withheld to the benefit of any race. \n\tMeredith and Halden are now monitoring the hydroponics room. They control two pest-like puppets which enact a fight scene: the smaller puppet, initially defeated by the larger, finds a knife and is able to slay the larger. The humans hope that the pests will be lured to the knife. Meredith and Halden then retire to his cabin, where she discusses the possible father of her children. Though she loves him, she dismisses the idea of bearing his child, as it will dilute her evolved biology. He strikes her and breaks her nose, but she quickly heals. He kisses her. \n",
            "Taphetta, a creature of the Ribboneer species, has recently been recruited by a team of humans to aid in navigating a mission to discover the human race's \"big ancestor\": the original source of all humans which are now scattered across the Milky Way. Curious, and slightly skeptical, of the mission, Taphetta interrogates Sam Halden, a biologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, about their theory of how humans evolved. Through analyzing the galactic routes of the human race and their locations throughout history, the team believes they have pinned the general home of the big ancestor. Taphetta agrees to help in the mission, under the condition that the team agrees to his own proposed contract rather than their own. As Taphetta prepares for navigation, he notes to Firmon, head of hydroponics, that he is bothered by the air quality on the ship. Firmon attempts to improve the air, however is met with an issue; the plants on the ship are being eaten by an unknown animal that hides within its machinery. With options limited to rebuilding the ship or baiting the animals through a risky experiment, Taphetta is again skeptical of the conditions of the ship. He requests that the team answer more questions while he thinks it over, and inquires about the big ancestor and its qualities. Emmer, a Neanderthal archaeologist, recounts his experiences growing up around the ruins of the ancestors; the infrastructure was all that they left behind, with no other scrap of information that would indicate their existence, though it is likely that they left in search of another planet to live on while improving themselves through the alteration of their germ plasm. Taphetta then questions the motives of the mission, to which Emmer and Halden consider the abilities of the big ancestor, and how much of an achievement it would be to gain the knowledge they possessed biologically. Holden asks Taphetta what the difference was between the contract the team proposed and his own; he responds and says that his contract ensured the discoveries made on this mission would not be withheld for humans exclusively. With Taphetta agreeing to baiting the animals, the team uses a realistic puppet that resembles the pests, with a retractable knife that is able to kill them when they get close. After a successful test run, Halden and linguist Meredith, who have an intimate relationship to each other, go back to Halden's cabin, where they discuss the future, including having children. Meredith, who is of a higher race than Halden, admits that her main concern is bearing children that are as superior as possible, which requires a partner of a higher race than her. This angers Halden, resulting in him striking her, yet they both love each other and their passion overweighs their tension."

            "Taphetta the Ribboneer was on another ship that was passing by the expedition ship. Since the pilot that was supposed to fly the expedition got very sick and needed some treatment, he was taken by the other ship, and they told the explorers that they have an experienced pilot on board. After having Taphetta on the expedition ship, they introduce themselves and explains how they are at different points on the development spectrum. However, unlike human themselves, Taphetta does not see any difference between the early and late stage of humans, they are all the same to her. \n\nLater they explain the theory of horse shoe planets, the adjacency mating principle and suggest that they are likely to find their origin planet on their trip. Taphetta is interested and asks them to take her contract. Taphetta is afraid of them holding discoveries for the benefit of one race, thus offers them his own contract. While the truth is that the explorers are not going to hold anything, no one can be sure of the institutions that support this expedition. \n\nFurthermore, Taphetta senses that something is wrong with the air, which makes them realize that there has been animals consuming the plants they grew. Despite the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to risk bait for the pest, he is convinced. ",
            "Taphetta is a part of the Ribboneer racial group. He has four flat legs, a wide and thin body with a flat neck. His head is thick and is topped with a dozen narrow, long ribbons. He is an experienced pilot, which is common among people in his group. Ribboneer\u2019s are well-known for their navigational ability in the universe. \n\nTaphetta was on board a ship that was passing a group in need of help. The group had a pilot that became sick and they hailed a ship that was passing by to get him to treatment. They heard that there was an experienced pilot on the passing ship, which is how Taphetta came upon their group. The group is trying to convince Taphetta to pilot them to their desired destination. He presents them with a contract that they have to accept for him to agree to the mission. His contract includes a provision that any discovery during the mission cannot be withheld to benefit one race. They accept the contract. He begins to be ready for the mission. \n",
            "Taphetta is a member of the non-human species known as Ribboneers, who are renowned for their integrity and navigational skills. He is described as having four flat, ribbon-like legs which loop out and tuck under his flat body. His neck is thicker than the rest of his body, and his head has a crown of many smaller ribbons. Prior to the start of the story, the pilot of the humans\u2019 ship falls ill. They hail a ship passing by, partly in an attempt to find a new pilot. Taphetta was on that ship, and the story begins with a conversation between him and the human biologist, Sam Halden. \n\tHalden describes to Taphetta the theory behind the expedition on which the human ship has embarked, concerning an ancestor common to the many planets of humans in the Milky Way galaxy. Though initially uninterested, Taphetta is confronted with evidence for the humans\u2019 theory, and later admits that they make a compelling argument. Taphetta arees to join the crew of the expedition, on the condition that he be hired under an extensive micro-printed contract which stipulates that no discovery in which he takes part should be hidden to the benefit of any race. \nOn the ship, Taphetta suffers from the air quality. Ribboneers breathe through tubes scattered throughout their bodies. Halden discovers that the problem is animals interfering with the growth of plants in the hydroponics sector of the ship, which are responsible for air quality regulation. Halden proposes using bait to trap the pests, to which Taphetta says he needs to think on the issue. As he thinks, Taphetta enquires further about the evidence supporting the humans\u2019 theory, asking about the significance of discovering an answer, and the unequal development of humans across various planets. Aftering demonstrating interest in the answers given by his interlocutor Emmer, an archeologist, he acquiesces to use of bait to deal with the pest problem.\n",

Taphetta is also an experienced pilot, as his species specializes in navigation. Taphetta is recruited by the humans to guide their ship for their mission in finding their original ancestor, as their initial pilot became ill. Taphetta is a wary and dubious creature, so he asks several questions before agreeing to help. He also requires that the team agree to his own terms and contract, which demand transparency in their findings and condemn the withholding of information. Taphetta settles into the ship, but is uncomfortable with the cleanliness of the air; the team recognizes how crucial Taphetta's compliance is to their mission and stages an experiment to catch pests that are damaging the ship's plants. Taphetta uses this as another opportunity to ask questions and gauge more information on the mission."

She admits that she is in love and is physically attracted to Halden, but she does not want that to convince her to be in a relationship with him. They have tension in the story that creates a fight where Halden instinctively punches Meredith in the nose. Halden recognizes that Meredith is cruel to him and perhaps using him, yet he too loves her.

Halden briefly recalls the previous times when she did the same, before they return to his cabin. Halden reflects on Meredith\u2019s physical attractiveness, but concludes that her facial features are plain. She reiterates her desire against bearing children with him, for they would be of a lower evolutionary status than she is. Halden comments that, if she were searching for a mate who would yield offspring of the higher type, then Kelburn, a far-advanced human, would be the best choice. However, Meredith implies that she and Kelburn have previously attempted to mate, but are incompatible with one another. She nuzzles Halden, before he instinctively hits her.

Additionally, Meredith is preoccupied with the idea of bearing children that are biologically superior; she believes that having children with Halden would be a setback and against her morals. For these reasons, Meredith plans to explore bearing children with humans from other races, which enrages Halden.

            "The goal of the expedition is to find their original home. There are many different species on the human development spectrum, and it is assumed that they can only mate with the species that are close to them on the spectrum according to the adjacency mating principle. Following this principle, careful calculations are done on the orbits of those planets. By determining their location in space at different times, the team are able to find a specific time in the whole universe that not only makes the specific pattern of a horse shoe, but also has supporting data backed up this hypothesis. Furthermore, if two imaginary lines extend from the ends of the horse shoe, the two lines will eventually meet and cross over at a specific location in space. The team are able to narrow the crossing point down to a few cubic light-years. According to the team, this space should be the place that their original home is. If they are to find the planet that the hypothetical unknown ancestors belongs to, they will be making cultural discoveries, technological advances, and finding out where they actually come from. ",
            "The mission of the expedition is to find the origins of the human race. Taphetta refers to this as the big ancestor. The theory is that the human race did not originate on any planets that it currently inhabits. They believe that humans evolved at a different location and then began to settle across a particular section of the Milk Way. Their evidence to support this theory is that there are worlds where humans have been before the Stone Age and are not related to anything in that world. \n\nAnother supporting theory they present is the adjacency mating principle. The principle outlines which humans can mate with each other, theorizing that those which can mate had to have been physically close at one point. \n",

Furthermore, it appears that the path traced by their ancestor attempts to gather a representative sample of planets in the Milky Way. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ancestors\u2019 aim to find an inhabitable planet. Were the pattern extended, the original home of the common ancestors would be found, and to find this common home is the purpose of the expedition. \n",

To make sense of these circumstances, the mission's team believes that one original ancestor exists from which all humans came from, and were then dispersed throughout the Milky Way. There is also a pattern in the ways human races can interbreed; humans can mate with other humans that were adjacent to each other two hundred thousand years ago, indicating that this historical proximity points to a source of the big ancestor. The mission of this expedition is to travel to that location in search of the big ancestor, hopefully gaining cultural insight into the species as well as their superior biological abilities that make them able to mutate and improve themselves."

            "The story is set in a space ship of an expedition with the goal of finding human\u2019s original home. The universe has many species of human beings at different development levels, and four of them are on board of the ship. They seem to believe that there is a planet of origin, where they evolved. They assume that later, they were brought from the original planet to the planets they now live on. There was another ship that passed the expedition ship, which allow the explorers to send their pilot home since he is sick. They learn that there is a Ribboneer on that ship. The Ribboneer is a pilot and has been to some expeditions. Thus, the team want to have him on board and be the pilot of their ship. Hence, they start to explain about their theories in trying to find out about human race and their origin. The Ribboneer is interested and decides to join the team. Later, they notice that the plants are being eaten by some animals. Thus they put on a show at the hydroponics to trick the animals. Later, we follow Halden and Meredith to Halden\u2019s cabin where they have an argument over the level of development they have and Halden punches Meredith\u2019s nose. Then, the story ends with the two of them in Halden\u2019s room. ",
            "The story is set on a ship in space settled in the Milky Way. There is a projector on the spaceship that Kelburn uses to explain their theory of the origins of Man. The ship is quite isolated as it is currently located four months away from the nearest planet. The ship they are on is old, which creates some problems for them when trying to find a pest. The ship had new equipment added to its old frame, this has created hard to reach corners and small crevices that cannot be fixed without a proper rebuilding effort. There is a plant growing area on the ship that does not use soil in its growing. Halden has his own cabin on the ship. ",
            "This story takes place in a human spaceship, floating in the expanse of space next to another ship. Prior to the start of the story, the human pilot falls ill and is unable to be treated with the resources on their ship. Fortunately, another ship, the one now idling next to the human ship, was passing and has agreed to return the pilot home. Coincidentally, a passenger of the other ship, Taphetta, is a ribbonrer, a species known for their navigational skills, and agrees to pilot the human ship on their expedition. \n\tLater in the story, when Meredith and Halden are monitoring the goings-on in the hydroponics room, they are in a room with a big screen displaying a night-vision feed of the hydroponics room. Meredith and Halden then return to Halden\u2019s room. \n",
            "The story takes place on the expedition team's ship, which is in an unknown part of space. The ship is designed for humans, making Taphetta's comfortability a bit more difficult to achieve, as indicated by his dissatisfaction with the air quality. The ship contains tanks of plants that, when running smoothly, produce oxygen to supply the ship. The ship also contains cabins for each team member. Outside the ship, not much is visible that indicates location; the only thing visible out the window is a neighboring ship from which Taphetta was pulled from."

The captain says they have sighted Earth. Talking burst out happily, the captain's wife is anxious about nothing being the same after nine hundred years on Earth, while it was only ten for the crew in space. The course to Earth is set and the whole crew is filled with anticipation. The captain can't find how to kill time and delves into upsetting thoughts about the failure of the venture. The captain rewatches his record from the beginning of the voyage. It shows his hopes fading with every new planet proving unfit for settlement and the Earth years increasing rapidly and frighteningly. By then, the captain had an idea of going to Omega Centauri without returning to Earth, as this planet was more than forty thousand years away from Earth. The reasoning was that the captain didn't want to bring news of a failure to Earth, but eventually he decided to return no matter what. Back to reality, the captain starts thinking about his awaiting future on Earth, when a jar goes  through the ship. Very soon the captain calms down, considering a meteoroid to be the reason, but a call informs him the ship is attacked by other ships. The captain rushes up joined by his son, the whole crew is panicking. The ship is not harmed though and still landing, as there is no other place for it to go. The attack seems well-planned and the crew broadcasts an audio wave, asking the attackers who they are and introducing themselves. There is no answer and Zost, a crew member, traces no lights or urban features on Earth, even no trees or grass are detected. Suddenly, a strange voice acknowledges that the other two ships were destroyed, and Quest III will be as well if it continues towards Earth. The captain learns out soon that the voice simply tries to frighten them and is not that confident, and is told that Quest I preferred suicide to defeat and went into the Sun. The vision connection happens and the man on the other side avoids the question why, proclaiming that the Quest III's crew must die. \n",
            "The Quest III has spent ten years on a voyage into space in search of a habitable planet for humanity to live on following an overpopulation crisis on Earth. However, because of space travel and how it warps time, the ten years on Quest III have actually been 900 years on Earth, and now, after failing to find said planet, the ship is returning home. The captain of Quest III, Knof Llud, reports to the crew that they have identified Earth, and the crew is excited and emotional about the prospect of going home. Llud's wife, Lesra, expresses fear about what the ship would be returning to on Earth, but Llud reassures her. Llud finds Den, the Navigator, who asks him about the reception they would get when returning to Earth. Llud goes to his cabin, feeling drained from the voyage, and reflects on the past ten years, watching old tapes documenting the trip and its discoveries. He notes another discovery that the ship had made about Omega Centauri, a global cluster that could have been the home of a planet for humanity. However, Llud had to choose between returning to Earth and going to Omega Centauri because of limited fuel on the ship, and he had hesitantly decided to return home. As Quest III approaches Earth, they are attacked by unknown spacecrafts. Fearful, the crew analyzes the spacecrafts, which are surprisingly small. Quest III has a strong armor, but the crafts repeatedly attack the ship, with more and more approaching. The crew notes these as robot crafts, but it is soon discovered that they are tiny spaceships. Since the last 900 years on Earth, humans have gotten smaller, eventually evolving into minuscule beings. One of the small men reveals that Quest I had returned and also been attacked before surrendering and flying into the Sun, and advises that Quest III do the same. Llud asks them why they want to kill Quest III, to which they respond that they \"must die\"",
            "It has been nine hundred years since Quest III left Earth. The space ship that is set to explore the space and find some planet that might be suitable for living, since Earth has reached a dangerously unstable phase. Due to the time axis of a space ship approaching light speed, it has been only ten years for thee passengers aboard on the ship. The story begins with Knof Llud, the captain of Quest III, announcing that they have sighted Earth. Though it just appears as a featureless disk on the telescope, people cheered and cried. Then the captain\u2019s wife, Lesra, seems to be worried about what has happened to Earth during this nine hundred years that they were gone. She worries that they won\u2019t fit in, and everything they once were familiar with are different now. During this few hours before they reach Earth, the captain goes to his private office-cabin and started to view records of their trip. He first views one among the earliest. In the record, he was energetic and, despite a blank visit to Procyon, there was idealism. Then the captain selected a later one where they still have not find any planets. They are starting to believe that the Sun\u2019s world is a rare accident. Finally he takes a record that is only four years old, when they\u2019ve reached the furthest point from Earth, according to the plan. While they could have gone to Omega Centauri, a cluster of stars twenty thousand light years away. They decided to turn back and return to Earth. \n\nSuddenly, as they get close to Earth, they are under attack by a few very small ships. The captain was relieved since those small ships does not carry large enough weapons to damage  Quest III, the crew on board almost do not feel the vicious onslaught being done to their ship. As more and more groups of attackers arrive, while some of the earlier ones go back for refill of ammunition, they start to get worried and believe that this is a planned attack. They start to broadcast questions asking the attacker to identify themselves. Finally, the images of Earth arrive, and to their surprise, it seems as if mold has covered all the cities. Then the attackers\u2019 voice comes back, stating that they know who they are and tells them to stop coming toward Earth, or they will be destroyed like the other Quest ships. ",
            "The story begins aboard a ship called Quest III. The ship has been traversing the galaxy for years and is now returning to Earth. The story begins with the captain of the ship, Knof Llud, descending into a recreation room where many of the crew members are gathered. He announces to the group that they have spotted Earth. The crowd reacts openly with feelings of excitement and joy. His wife, Lesra, expresses her own feelings of nervousness about the unknown that Earth brings. The captain too has his own doubts. \n\nThe ship gets closer to Earth and they are able to experience the Sun. The Navigator, Gwar Den, asks the captain if he has any thoughts about the reception they might receive upon their return. The captain says no one can be sure. Knof goes to his private office cabin to wait until there is more news about their approach to Earth. As he is waiting, he thinks through the 900 Earth years that he has spent on the ship. He listens through recordings of himself when he was much younger and relives the feelings it felt at the time. He thinks about how he had the option to pursue an expedition of the globular cluster of Omega Centauri but instead chose to return to Earth. He cannot think of why he really chose to return to Earth besides the longing and familiarity it had. \n\nDuring the captain\u2019s time of reflection, there is a sudden jolt on the ship. The captain because confused about the potential trouble. He is informed by Den that the ship is being attacked. He orders the alarms to be sound in response. Den details that there are multiple tiny crafts attacking their ship. The attacks were not damaging the ship, but they were dangerous because they were depleting the already very limited fuel supply. \n\nEventually, the attackers make contact with the Quest III. The captain talks to the person and believes that they are trying to frighten them because they are frightened themselves. He is able to confirm that the person he is speaking to is human, but is unable to discern why he seems so strange. The voice continues to threaten to kill him and the rest of the crew on the ship. \n\n"

With the limited fuel reserves that the Quest III ship had left, going to Omega Centauri would be a one-way trip. If the globular cluster proved to be as useless as every other location, the ship and its crew members would have no fuel to go anywhere else. Earth was a safer option because its existence was reality, at least when the ships left 900 Earth years ago. Omega Centauri was very uncertain. "

            "Jig Bentley and his business partner Bucky Shannon run a zoo together in space. Their ship is currently stationed on Mars. Bucky is the owner of the zoo and Jig is his right hand man. Both they and the zoo are broken. That is until one night they are visited by Simon Beamish, a mysteriously rich man who offers them 100 U.C's to charter their circus to perform on Venus. They agree, but the night before they're set to leave, they pay a visit to their main attraction, a cansin, a beast native to Venus, named Gertrude. While they are down in the area where they keep the various monsters that perform in their show, along with the zookeeper named Gow, a group of vapour snakes are released on the pair. Some unknown person let these beasts free, in an effort to kill the duo. Jig takes Bucky away from the closed off area, saving his life, then blacks out. Later they wake up, speculating over who would want to kill them. They make the trip to Venus, while Gertrude is becoming restless. She is lonely and needs a mate. If she doesn't get one, Gow fears she might break out and wreak havoc. They arrive in Venus, where Ahra, one of the performers tells Jig that something has been taken from Venus, and death is coming. Jig then notices a run down Sam Kepper, a hunter he is acquainted with. Kepper falls and the pair rush over to him. A mystery man gives Kepper a cigarette, then leaves. They bring him into a bar, where Kepper tells him that he has found and acquired  a male cansin. Kepper tells Jig that he must take it back. Soon after this, he falls unconscious. Just then, Beamish arrives at their table. Jig walks over to the bar, noticing the group of men that are in the bar. Jig asks the barman what Kepper was drinking, and when he turns around, he notices the man that gave Kepper the cigarette. \nTHE END. ",
            "The Blue Behemoth story begins with Bucky Shannon and Jig sitting around a table talking about how they are not doing well with their business. Jig insults the circus and notably upsets Bucky who responds with violence. Before Bucky can hurt Jig too bad, they are interrupted by a stranger. The stranger is offering the two a lot of money for their circus. Jig does not feel comfortable with the stranger but is willing to set aside his uneasiness because they desperately need the money that the stranger is offering. They begin to listen to what the stranger is offering \u2013 a charter to their circus for money and negotiate details about monetary compensation. Gow interrupts their conversation to complain about Gertrude, a member of their circus, not acting right. When they let it slip that Gertrude is a cansin, an extremely rare animal, Beamish appears impressed by the news. Beamish agrees to the terms of the contract and leaves Bucky and Jig. \n\nOnce he leaves, Jig implies that they have to pay people back before they can enjoy a large amount of money they have come into. They return to the spaceport where Bucky\u2019s Imperial Circus is lounging around, there are about twenty of them sitting there. While in the spaceport, Bucky expresses that he wants to go see Gertrude. Jig does not. They go down a dark hallway in search of Gertrude. Jig smells a sour and wild scent emanating in the area. They hear loud screaming and can sense that Gertrude is suffering because she cannot find someone to mate. Jig emphatically tells Gow that it is impossible because a male cansin has never been seen nor proven to exist. \n\nSoon chaos is let loose. Vapor snakes are somehow let out and Jig and Bucky attempt to run away. Bucky causes Jig to stumble and the snakes are able to get to them, burning them through their clothes. They pass out and wake up in a cell with injuries. Bucky says that someone had to have let the snakes out. He wants to know why someone wanted to kill them. They are unable to figure out who did it. Someone named Sam comes up to them and then they start running towards him because they realize they recognize him. They get Sam into a shack and ask him what happened. Sam is desperately trying to communicate that he found a male cansin and wants them to take it back. He then appears to pass out and they find Beamish standing behind a curtain. Jig notices that there is something unusual about the audience at the bar and tries to explain the situation. \n",
            "Bucky Shannon and Jig are the heads of Shannon's Imperial Circus, a circus that tours around space. They are sitting in a bar, defeated due to the lack of success in their circus. Bucky and Jig are out of money with their circus in pathetic condition. They are then interrupted by a small man who asks for Bucky, holding a large amount of money. Bucky introduces himself and Jig, and the man introduces himself as Beamish. Beamish has taken an interest in Shannon's Imperial Circus and offers to charter it, proposing that the circus make a tour on the settlements along the Tehara Belt, on Venus. Jig, not wanting to seem too desperate or reveal the state of the circus to Beamish, is hesitant at first, saying they would have to cancel on events. The three are interrupted by Gow, the circus' zoo-keeper, who informs Bucky that Gertrude, a Venusian cansin that is the star of the circus, is not doing well. Beamish is impressed at the presence of a cansin, given there is only one other animal of the species. Jig names a price of one hundred U.C's for Beamish to join the partnership. Though a large amount of money, Jig advises that it is reserved for the men they owe it to. Bucky and Jig return to the circus spaceport, where they meet a group of men and give them money, then proceed to beat the group of men up. Once inside, Bucky convinces Jig to see Gertrude with him, and once they see her, they notice that she is in terrible condition. Gow informs them that Gertrude wants a mate, which is practically impossible because there are only two known cansins. Jig tells Gow to do what he can to help Gertrude, as him and Bucky head to bed. Once they start to rest, they wake in a panic as the Vapor snakes attack them, having escaped in the night. Jig awakes, injured, and Bucky concludes that they have been sabotaged by whoever let the snakes out. They suspect Beamish as the culprit, but sign his contract anyway out of a need for money. They then go on their trip to Venus, stopping at Nahru and meeting with Beamish and the gang. On their way to a bar, they come across Sam Kapper, a hunter who supplies animals to attractions. Kapper is in visible pain. They take him into the bar, asking him what had happened. Kapper eventually tells them that he has found a male cansin, but before he can say where, he dies. Beamish is found to be listening in on the conversation."

            "Bucky, the owner, is of a rather idealistic opinion of the circus. He considers it great and he loves the participants as they are loyal and good. Jig is rather realistic, he knows the circus is broken and lousy, with Gertrude, the huge cansin, being the only worthy creature, though even she is old. Jig is also not that fond of many creatures, he sees them as ugly, some scary, some absurd. The state of Gertrude made Bucky cry, and soon he confessed that he actually knows that the circus is not great, but he loves it no matter what. Jig tried to be practical and asked Gow to snap Gertrude out of this state for the good of the circus. Nevertheless, even Jig was touched by the creature's appearance and gaze full of grief, her screams made him tremble. The Nahali woman, claiming to smell death, made Jig feel anxious and scared. Throughout the story Jig keeps feeling uneasy around the creatures and tries to avoid them, limiting the interactions to business. Bucky, at the same time, sympathizes with them and tries to get closer. ",
            "Bucky and Jig's attitudes towards the cirsus are very different. Jig thinks over the circus as a dump. It is merely a means of staying afloat financially for him. The things of the performers as uncivilised, unintelligent and below him. He looks down upon their superstitions and beliefs. He hates the beasts that are used in the circus, as they somehow make him feel less human. He hates that the circus itself is run down, as they are broke. \nBucky on the other hand loves the circus. He thinks of the performers as family. It is his pride and joy and he is willing to fight anyone who says otherwise, including Jig. He checks up on Gertrude, clearly showing his affection for her. He knows that the circus is run down, but he loves it still. It's like his child. \n",
            "Jig shouts at Bucky that he knows the circus is in a lousy and mangy state where nothing is working. He is not satisfied with the circus and believes that it \u201cstinks\u201d. Bucky also states that he does not believe the circus is doing well, though he is not happy when Jig agrees with these assertions enthusiastically. Gertrude is a member of their circus and they describe her as temperamental. While they do not believe the circus is doing well, they feel loyal to the members of their circus. Bucky relates to Jig that he is happy they have been loyal to him and he wants to reward them for that. Bucky loves the circus no matter how ugly or no good the members appear or act. ",
            "Bucky and Jig have a soft spot for their circus, having run it for eleven years. Jig is aware of the state of the circus, with Bucky in slight denial but eventually accepting its condition. What once was the Greatest Show in Space has become a broken, unappealing attraction. However, due to the amount of time that Bucky and Jig have devoted to the circus, it is their only source of purpose and income. Despite the unhopeful state of the circus, they both try to remain optimistic about improving it, leading to their contract with Beamish and their concern over Gertrude. "

He insults the circus to Bucky, and just as Bucky goes to give Jig a beating, they are met by Beamish. Jig tells Beamish that they will charter out their circus to him for 100 U.C's. Jig is really pushing his luck with this offer, ready to haggle, but Beamish agrees on the fee.

After the meeting and when they receive the money, Jig goes to pay the members of the circus. \n\nWhile on the spaceport, Jig reluctantly goes with Bucky to see Gertrude who is in severe distress. Somehow, the vapor snakes are let out and they are coming after Jig and Bucky. Jig tries to run away to safety but he is tripped and pinned down by Bucky. This allows the vapor snakes to come and attack him which burn him through his clothes. He passes out due to this incident and wakes up in a cell with many injuries. \n\nLater, while on the planet Venus, Jig and Bucky run into Sam Kapper, someone they recognize. Sam tries to excitedly tell the two that there is a male cansin before he passes out and is perceived to be dead. Jig goes to pull back the curtains in the small area that they have been talking to Sam and finds Beamish hiding behind the curtains. He pulls the curtain back defiantly and walks to the bar to order a drink. During this walk, he notices that the audience for this situation is unusual.

Later that day, Jig returns to the circus with Bucky, where they pay men at the entrance before fighting them. Jig then sees Gertrude and heads to bed, where he is attacked by loose Vapor snakes.

            "The first encounter between Beamish and the two occurred when Jig and Bucky were at the point of a fight. Beamish prevented them from this unnecessary action, and soon he saved the circus. The circus was broke, the performers were discontent with not getting their bills, the construction was loose, etc. There would be no tour and existence of the circus overall without this encounter. Being able to pay the gang, Jig and Bucky could show up without being afraid or ashamed to show up in their circus and keep doing business. This encounter was also somehow connected with the attempt to kill the two by letting the vapor snakes out. The trip to Venus in the end was also caused by this encounter, as it was the place where Beamish awaited for his partners and the gang. Therefore, he was somehow connected with them meeting Sam, a hunter supplying animals for the circus, and his eventual weird death. Beamish listening to their dialogue and overall investing in a broke circus creates a suspicion of his actions having some hidden reason. Together with the unhappiness of the gang and one creature smelling death, Beamish's unclear intentions seem scheming and threatening, adding to the intrigue of the whole story. ",

It's unclear where Beamish's money comes from. Because they get the money, the duo are finally able to pay back the men that they have been avoiding for weeks.

Beamish is wanting to offer Bucky and Jig money to charter their circus for a tour of different settlements along the Tehara Belt. They would have never gone to Venus if not by the order of Beamish and thus they never would have met up with Sam as they did in the story. It is significant that they meet Beamish because according to the same Beamish is a male cansin and previously Bucky and Jig did not believe they existed anymore. ",

Though the offer is a bit shady and not completely promising, Bucky and Jig prefer it over their current situation. Taking up Beamish's offer leads Bucky and Jig to a new tour on Venus."

At his going away party he is given a watch, and academics like Lifting Gubelin and Dr Hans Girarad-Perregaux speak on his behalf. Si has decided to take the money he has saved up from his time working, which most people in the Ultrawelfare state don't, and live a simple comfortable life. He intends to never work again, after his six space flights. The currency used in the state was universal, controlled by a personal credit card. Because most jobs were automated, few people had to work, so most people lived off of a set welfare, and those selected to work were given a little extra compensation. Si was one of these people. Gubelin and Perregaux are both horrified by the fact that Pond has decided to take an early retirement. He was their only pilot for their space program, and if they were to get another, it would take at least a year of training. Without a pilot, they are worried that their funding will be cut, and the space program will be shut down. They scheme together as to how to get Pond back in the space program. They think that the only way to get him back would be to make sure he was left without any money, and therefore would have no choice but to return to his former position. \nSi is planning a big night out. He has always gone and celebrated when there was a cause, and tonight, he was planning to spend at least half of all the money in his account. He gets dressed in his retirement rank suit to go out, checks his balance, and then takes his vacuum tube to New york city.

They get to talking and before long, she tells him she recognises him, telling him about how moved she found his whole retirement ceremony. Making it very clear she wasn't happy he was retiring.

            "Seymour Pond is retiring from being a space pilot. Gubelin and Perregaux, big figures in space exploration, want to urge the man to stay as space has to be delved further into. The problem is that there are not enough young people willing to venture and explore the space. Pond is the only trained pilot in the world and they need him, while he has just enough fortune to retire with comfort. Without him the whole space exploration department will be terminated, so Gubelin and Perregaux think of means to deprive Seymour of his money and force him to go back to space. Seymour at that time is planning how to spend his money - he wants to spend a huge sum on the best entertainment. So, the ex-Space Pilot heads towards Manhattan in an automatic car. Seymour gets a luxurious room in a hotel and goes to get a drink in an expensive bar there. There he meets a graceful Oriental girl, and he offers her a drink. Soon she recognizes the famous pilot and starts treating him like a celebrity with utmost surprise of the possibility of talking to him. Turns out she is a huge fan of space and Seymour starts telling her things. "

            "The Ultrawelfare State is a distant future society, based upon the main ideas of communism. Every person in the state is guaranteed shares in the society, which translates to money, food, clothes, housing, medical care and education. The money of the nation is doled out by the economic planning board, who determine how the communal wealth is spent. Everyone is given a universal credit card, which only they can access, and they can check their balances on the teevee phones. The way in which people are selected to work in the state is very interesting. In this society, most jobs are automated, so very few people are unfortunate enough to have to work. People are selected for different jobs based on their physical and mental qualifications. People who don't work have their assigned shares to live off of, and those that are selected to work are given a little extra as compensation. When the society was first formed, they tried to give everyone work, but they realised that it was no good to have people working for two hours, two days a week, so they created the draft lottery. Most people live in small apartments, and the fortunate living Si, are able to afford vacuum tubes, which can take you anywhere in an instant. It is only the swankiest of places that have real people working in them. All payment is automated, and different settings of rooms can be changed in an instant in fancy hotels. ",
            "The Ultrawelfare State in the early days has attempted to give everyone work by providing  little amount of working hours and working days. It was not practical and people did not know their job well, thus it was not efficient. Hence later, the system is designed so that everyone at Ultrawelfare State finishes their basic education at the age of twenty-five, and they will be a part of the lottery for employment. Once they are drawn to serve in a certain industry, they cannot deny. Those at work, or are just employed will receive additional Variable Basic shares, which can be added to their portfolios, for more money, hence better and more comfortable life style. People that are born in the Ultrawelfare State obtain a number of Basic shares that allow them to enjoy the fundamental womb-to-tomb security, including food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and education. \n\nThe Department of Space Exploration at Ultrawelfare State has only one pilot, who has just resigned, and they are close to terminate as their appropriastions for expeditions has been very difficult to obtain. But the officers there believe they are onto some important breakthrough. \n\nUsing vacuum-tube vehicles, one can travel between cities very quickly and it reaches their destination directly. Moreover, one can stay at a hotel room for ten minutes to check if they are satisfactory before confirming their stay by paying with their credit card. ",
            "The Ultrawelfare State dictates the lives of its citizens. The State guarantees fundamental security through issues of Basic shares that provide enough income to secure food, clothing, medical care, shelter, and education. In the Ultrawelfare State, money is tightly restricted. No one else can use or steal or con a person out of their money. The State also regulates how labor is conducted. It conducts a labor draft that requires people to participate if their name is drawn. Individuals are given extra shares depending on their job assignments. ",
            "People born in the Ultrawelfare State are issued a minimum number of Basic shares which guarantee right enough income for survival. Then people get basic education and work for the country's labour. A few people were driven to work, others just lived with their Inalienable Basic stocks. There is a department of space exploration in the state and its pilots get more Basic shares and can retire after six flights. The pilots are carefully chosen upon their qualifications as the profession is the most dangerous in the state. The job brings money for life more comfortable than most people in the state have. Nevertheless, young people do not want to venture and become space pilots, they don't have this desire for adventures. People in the state mostly don't contribute to its welfare and aren't needed. All jobs are done by machines, a human bartender, for example, is a sign of luxury. "

Perregaux tells Gubelin about a theory, where a sailor, who has been out at sea for many months, will always blow his hard earned money on one night out the minute he's back in town, no matter how much he wanted to save it. This is because of the loneliness of the sailor, and their need to make up for all the experiences that he has missed out on while he was at sea. The sailor will wake up the next morning, having spent all his money, without a cent to his name. Then, he will have to go back out to sea, to make back the money he has lost, so the cycle continues. Perregaux believes that Pond is this sailor, and if only they could set a trap for him, in which it would cause him to lose all his money in one night, he would have to go back to work for them. They plant Natalie Paskov, a beautiful woman at the bar where Pond goes. She interacts with him as if he's famous, stroking his ego. She then goes on to show her disdain for the idea that he has retired, and he orders them drinks. And so the night begins, with Pond starting to get drunk, and lose all his money to Natalie. ",
            "Gubelin and Perregaux plan to get Pond back in the space program by a method similar to the sailor way of life, but a modern day version. The sailor normally goes on trips for months at the sea, where he dreams of his retirement and such. But once he reaches the port, he goes drinking, which leads to other things such as getting tattooed or even go to jail. Spending all of his money all at once, he has to go back to the sea for another trip. Gubelin and Perregaux have decided to use a similar method on Pond, so that he is forced to go back to the space program. ",

Perregaux explains how they have to treat Seymour like a sailor from the past who is talking of retirement. A sailor would speak of retirement but then at a port, get too drunk, have a consequently messy night that ended with him in jail. The previous night would cause the sailor to have to continue to sail instead of retiring. They then suggest that they will have to adapt the pattern with more modern methods and apply them to Seymour. It can be assumed that Natalie, the woman he meets at the hotel bar, was sent by Gubelin and Perregaux to convince him to return to his job. ",
            "For the two, the matter of bringing Seymour out of his retirement is essential. They have tried speeches about the importance of his missions and promises of enormous fame and wealth, but it didn't work. They are ready to use any means as they need Seymour to save their department. They want to make the ex-pilot lose all his money and need more. In their time it's almost impossible to steal someone's money. SO, the two decide to make him himself spend all his money. "

            "Pond seems to be obsessed with money. At his retirement, he is given a gold watch. He thinks to himself how much better it would have been if they had simply given him money instead. He vows to live a simple, comfortable life, keeping an eye on his money so it will last him for the rest of his days. He is very proud of the fact that he can afford a luxury like his vacuum tube. Whenever something goes well in Pond's life, he loves to splurge on a night out. He ends up spending enormous amounts of money on things that he sometimes deems as \"sub-par\" for a man of his status. On this one fateful night, he decides that he deserves the best of everything. He is obsessed with the idea of wealth and fame, and checks himself into the nicest hotel he can think of in New York City, partially because he presumes he might see some celebrities there. He checks the balance on his credit card often, and when he goes down to the hotel bar, he has to restrain himself from checking how much a single drink costs. He looks around for signs of famous people, but is disappointed when he sees none. He gives into the flattery of Natalie when she gushes over him, as if he were famous, believing her obvious depciet, and buying her a drink. Fame and money are everything to Pond. ",

He does not want to be extremely wealthy, a one room mini-auto-apartment along with an autochair, built-in autobar, a teevee screen is enough for him. With the six trips to space, he has enough money for a comfortable life; he does not want more wealth, which can be obtained from going on more trip. But he keeps on warning himself about not spending too much money so quickly, since he has been doing that multiple times before. Moreover, he believes that reputation for being a wise guy or for being a cloddy is not good since there is the Inalienable Basic stock. However he still wears his air force pin on his suit. ",

He notes that he can get preferential treatment when out of town due to his prestige as a space pilot.

He starts off seeing a prisoner called Sue-Ann Bradley, who is having problems with a block guard named Sandro. She explains to him that Mathias, another prisoner, did not give her proper instructions and called the guards on her after ten minutes. O\u2019Leary gives Sue-Ann a warning, but Sandro informs him that she has already received a similar warning the day before. He changes his mind and sends her to three days in Block O. O\u2019Leary then begins to think about his job and how it is a good civil-service job. He then thinks about the figs (clerks) and how they are still important members of society even if there should not regularly be a cross between the barriers of the two classes. Sue-Ann, on the other hand, is taken to the Block O disciplinary block. The leading citizens, Flock, and Sauer begin shrieking at her as soon as she arrives. The guards exchange some words regarding the new additions to the block, and Sue-Ann walks through the gate to reach her cell. The two of them begin screaming and howling again. The guards are annoyed, and Sue-Ann starts to weep for real. Meanwhile, O\u2019Leary informs Warden Godfrey Schluckebier of the upcoming trouble he senses, but the warden brushes his concerns as nothing dangerous. The warden reminds O\u2019Leary that they each have their jobs to worry about. Suddenly, the warden gets a phone call, and he realizes that the call is made from Cell Block O by Flock. The events preceding this call cut back to Sue-Ann, who is still in her cell when Flock initially screams in agony. The guard issues a ten-minute rest period, and the tangler fields are turned off. While the inmates are getting up, the guard notices that Flock is still doubled over in pain due to his cramps. He unties the prisoner, but he sees a strange smell that is reminiscent of scorched meat. To his surprise, Flock threatens him with a hidden handmade shiv. Sauer and Flock take the guards hostage, and they threaten the warden to send a medic down for first aid for Flock. The warden then requests to speak to the governor, which triggers a huge effect on various events. Jets, rockets, and helicopters are sent to contain the possible breakout.

He is at a hearing for the inmate Sue-Ann Bradley, who has broken the rules of her imprisonment by not mopping the floor of her cell, and getting into a fight with another inmate. He sentences her to three days in \"Block O\", the section of the prison for inmates who cause trouble. O\"Leary is annoyed he has to punish the girl, as she seems to him like a decent enough person. It is revealed through by officer Sodaro, that the reason she is in the prison is for conspiracy to violate the Categorised Class laws. These laws were put in place long before, to fine comb different evolutionary traits in humanity, and to section off the people who fit these traits into groups. They all had specific jobs, they could only procreate in their section, and they could not move between \"specialisations\". \nSue-Ann is moved to Block O, or \"Greensleeves' ' where we meet the characters of Sauer and Flock. They are loud, and clearly disturbed. They seem to be permanent inmates of block O. Sue-Ann is let into the block, where Sauer and Glock begin to shout. She starts to weep. \nO'Leary speaks with the warden, he senses trouble coming. The warden tells O'leary that he's too suspicious, and that there's nothing to worry about. Soon, the warden gets a call, a call from Flock. Flock had made a shiv and taken over one of the guards, and grabbed Sauer. \nThe Warden calls the governor and word quickly spreads fast on the outside. A riot ensues in the lower class. The air forces prepare for an assault on the prison, and make their way there. But, when they get there, there is no breakout, not yet. The city of 19 million people waits. They wait for a breakout that never comes. ",
            "The story begins with the Captain of the guards, Liam O\u2019Leary, wondering how a particular detainee, Sue-Anne Bradley got to the prison. A guard is telling Liam that she has not been following orders so Liam is considering putting Sue-Ann in the disciplinary O-block. Sue claims that the treatment is unfair because she did not understand the orders that she was given. Eventually, Liam decides to send her to Block O for three days. He still wonders how or why she ended up in the institution when she had such a good advantage in life. \n\nLiam then begins to recount that he is proud of his job and is satisfied with being a part of the Civil Service class. He argues that he readily understands his place in society and does not understand why Sue-Ann does not understand her place in society. A prison guard guides Sue-Ann to her cell in the Greensleeves and it appears to the guard that Sue-Ann is crying. However, she is actually trying not to throw up from the sight of seeing Sauer and Flock, two other prisoners. Sauer and Flock are referred to as \u201cwipes\u201d and they both have spent a very long time in prison. They are causing a loud ruckus within the block and Sue-Ann does not understand why they have to scream so much. \n\nLater on, the Warden and O\u2019Leary are having a conversation about O\u2019Leary\u2019s concerns. The warden does not treat them as important and ignores Liam\u2019s claims. The Warden keeps putting blue pills in his coffee and they seem to make him feel better. His phone rings, wish he picks up with annoyance. The phone call causes the Warden to apologize to O\u2019Leary because presumably his concern was appropriate and there is currently a situation at the prison. \n\nThe situation occurs in the O Block area. A guard opens Flock\u2019s cell and goes to check on him because Flock seems to be in immense pain. Flock surprises him and points a shiv at the guard. Flock phones the warden and demands to be sent a medic because he is hurt. The Warden sends out an alert that there is a riot and the news spreads around fast outside of the institution and in the city-state. The outside world is terrified of the impending riot and prepares for its emergence. The outside world prepares by heavily arming the perimeter of the prison with jets, rockets, and helicopters. They wait for the inevitable so long that they have to refuel. The breakout seems to not be happening. \n",
            "Liam O'Leary is a captain of guards in a correctional institution and he senses trouble. He sympathizes with a young detainee Bradley and wonders what got her mixed up with trouble when she possessed every advantage. She claims to have broken the rules due to a misunderstanding but he still has to punish her as Sodaro, the block guard, justly insists. The captain walks away thinking about specialization and the necessity of knowing one's place and being proud of whatever it is. Bradley is led to the disciplinary block and turns out women are rarely sent there. She falls in the beginning on the tangler field and shakes from disgust at the sight of two prisoner leaders. They yell and make sarcastic jokes and remind Bradley of animals causing her to weep. O'Leary tells the Warden about unnatural events taking place and the smell of trouble. The Warden wants them both to pay attention only to their own area of the job. A sudden call acknowledges the Warden of trouble. During the rest period in Block O Flock attacks the guard with a  hidden shiv causing pain to Flock himself. After holding the guard as a hostage, Flock and Sauer call the Warden and order to call a medic as Flock is hurt badly. The news of the riot spread immediately all around to the city governor, police departments, TVs, millions of people living near the Jug. The whole city is scared and prepares for the hugest breakout from the prison with guns and helicopters but it doesn't seem to come. "

            "\nThe conversation between Liam O'Leary and Warden Godfrey Schluckebier reveals that their society heavily relies on specialization to thrive. It is initially said that the direction of evolution is towards specialization, and this also includes mankind. However, humans can create whatever environment they want to specialize in. The warden tells O'Leary that he should not involve himself in the warden's affairs and that he had his own job to do too. He emphasizes that everybody's jobs are important, but it is even more essential to stick to one's own and not pass on another person's occupation. Although O'Leary is upset at how the warden ignores his warnings, Schluckebier reminds him that 'specialization is the goal for civilization,' which means he does not want to worry about O'Leary's job nor should O'Leary worry about his. This goal also reveals how extreme the belief that a specialized society is one of a higher degree. Letting any specialization mix will only result in half-specialists, who fall in the same category as people who cannot specialize and ultimately serve no purpose to the future of humanity. ",
            "Their conversation reveals the divides and the prejudices at play in the society in which they live in. O'Leary mentions how he thinks it's not right that men of different sections should be mixing together, not even for playing ball. The Warden seems to take a much kinder approach to this outlook. He thinks that while everyone should just stick to their own job, every job is important, and every person is important. The idea of passing is brought up. It is the idea that someone would eventually overcome their social class based on merit. This idea seems both taboo, and ok, as it is the main reason for sectioning in the first place. ",
            "From the conversation between O\u2019Leary and Warden Godfrey, Liam is discussing how he is worried because 2 different classes of people were interacting in a recreational manner with each other. This demonstrates that in this particular society, this course of action is not supposed to happen. Thus, it can be deduced that in the society they live in, different classes of people are not to mix. In addition, someone else cannot do another person\u2019s job in this society. The goal of their society is specialization, which means each person has a particular service they specialize in and provide. ",
            "The society is concerned about improving the civilization. It aims towards total specialization with everyone minding their own business in which they are genuinely good. When the trouble comes indeed, turns out the Warden should have listened to Liam. Therefore, this strict accordance to specialization doesn't always make good and when two specializations interfere it may be too late. It shows how the desire to make a perfect civilization so badly makes it full of stupid flaws."

            "Sue-Ann Bradley is also known as Detainee No. WFA-656R at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. She is a recent prisoner and has not been in prison for as long as many other inmates. Her parents both work in Civil Service. She has an excellent educational background and basically whatever a girl could want. However, she chooses to abandon all of that when she lets herself get tangled in dirty business that leads to her arrest. The main reason for her arrest is for conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. She is also described to be a figger-lover because of her actions. Sue-Ann comes off as defiant and courageous when she first steps forward to confront Sandro and O\u2019Leary to explain her side regarding the offense that Mathias reports her for doing. Inside Block O, she tries to walk bravely across the tanglefoot electronic fields only to fall on her face. Even though Sue-Ann is grateful to the guard for letting her attend to her affairs, she does make an effort to ignore him proudly. Despite this brave exterior that Sue-Ann exhibits, she does have moments of weakness. She begins to weep sincerely once the howling and screaming get worse. Although she initially refuses to let the guards hear her, she is eventually driven crazy by the senseless yelling and begins to weep freely. ",
            "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young girl, of quite a high status, the idea of which she tries to reject throughout the story. Her parents are civil service, which, while not the highest status, is respectable. She has tried to violate the categorised class laws, by being in love with a person who is below her own class. She has been put in prison for it. She is clearly not used to the gruff nature of the prison system, and doesn't understand the slang that the other inmates use. She is clearly quite emotional, not calling the Captain ``Sir\" out of anger, retching when she sees Flock and Sauer and weeping eventually in her cell. When she is in Block O, she notes to herself that it is a good thing that Sauer and Flock were still fighting against the system. She clearly values freedom. Freedom of speech, freedom to love whoever, freedom from this sectorial way of life. ",
            "Sue-Ann Bradley is a detainee at the Estates-General Correctional Institution. Captain O\u2019Leary describes her as a beautiful young girl. She is in the institution because of conspiracy to violate the Categoried Class laws. Her parents are of the Civil Service class and she was given a good education. Sue-Ann does not like to show that she is scared or nervous and it is evident that is very prideful from the way she conducts herself throughout the prison. She is not afraid to defend herself. ",
            "Sue-Ann Bradley is a young and attractive detainee in a correctional institution. She was brought up in a perfect environment and surprisingly got mixed into violating the Categories Class laws. She insists she made mistakes in the institution due to the lack of knowledge about her duties. She is emotional and appears angry with the unjust accusations and on the verge of hysteria. She tries to behave boldly and be careful, but just the sight of some makes her shake from the desire to retch. She appreciates resentment and anger and possesses these features. She is scared and disgusted with animal-like behavior and screams though. She is strong, nevertheless, and manages to behave decently. She even feels gratitude for the smallest things she gets at Block O. "

            "To the outside world, the Jug is a symbol of the lack of organization and control in the specialist society. Unlike normal street brawls or bar-room fights within the individual classes, the civilians see the Jug as where all classes end up together. This fact is extremely dangerous, because it goes against the values and goals of a higher civilization that the specialization society tries so hard to maintain. While most of the bonds that people form with one another are in their specialization classes, people from the Jug do not have to uphold this same obligation. There is also fear that once these criminals break out of the Jug, the neatly organized class order will become disrupted, and a riot larger than any prison can handle will occur amongst the people in the outside world. In the story, many already begin to prepare for the riots that will inevitably happen when the criminals break out of the Jug. ",
            "The Jug is a symbol of anarchy to the outside world. They are the lowest of the low in society. They scare the outside world so much because they break the rules of the civilisation which has been created. The prisoners all live and work together, despite their status in the outside world. It is a forgeign concept to those on the outside, who are forbidden to mingle with people of different classes. The Jug is also a symbol of how quickly you can get in trouble for trying to break the status quo. It is a symbol that is clearly used to incite fear into anyone who thinks of trying to pass as someone from a higher station to acquire a better job, or for two people of different sections who try to have a relationship together. It is a symbol above all of the consequences of not following the rules. \n",
            "The Jug is where all classes are grouped together. Outside of the Jug, the classes are completely separate and by that, they live in their own neighborhoods and perform separate jobs. The Jug represents a threat to the outside world because it breaks the standards that are followed. The outside world has constructed itself to be fit into neat compartmentations of society that separate individuals into different classes. Those classes do not exist in the Jug and could influence and thus threaten the operations of the outside world if the concept were to spread. ",
            "The Jug is the corrupt sludge on which the whole city-state is based. All classes are cast together in the Jug. Therefore, a riot there affects every class in the city. All the civilians are filled with horror and seek ways for defense. Lots of rockets and helicopters are immediately sent to the prison after this notice of possible riot as it must be prevented by all means. Aircraftswomen are scared knowing how the wipes are towards their kind and rush for weapons. The anxiety of the governor shows the level of danger as he sends such great forces to the prison. To keep the city-state alive there can be no mixing between classes. The riot would break this essential class division. And as we know from the other parts of the text, specialization was the most important thing for people by then. "

As the men are taking money from behind the counter, a woman, Miss English, makes a run for the door. She is shot at but missed, caught by one of the men at the door, and another citizen, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call for help. The men flee the bank and hop into a stolen car, just missing the incoming police. As the men get away, the car suddenly malfunctions and crashes into another car, and they are eventually caught by the police. Detective Stevenson discusses the incident with Detective Pauling, and he is perplexed by how the tires of the stolen car seemed to melt instantly, and how the words \"The Scorpion\" were branded into the car. The owner of the stolen car, John Hastings, arrives, and he confirms that the words were not on the car before it was stolen. Two days later, the Daily News receives a crank letter, addressed from \"The Scorpion\" and explaining that he fights crime, threatening criminals. The letter was not published. About a month after the robbery, another incident occurs in Brooklyn, where Jerome Higgins murders his wife and injures his sister after spending days in his bedroom. Police and cameramen arrive at his home, where a standoff occurs for an hour before Higgins suddenly throws his rifle and runs outside, his hands burned severely. Stevenson finds the rifle and sees \"The Scorpion\" burned into the side of it. Stevenson goes to Captain Hanks, questioning the similarities between the two events, and Hanks dismisses his conspiracies. The Daily Mail receives another letter, but still does not publish it. On Halloween, two gangs, the Challengers and the Scarlet Raiders, plan a rumble over territory. Judy Canzanetti is a lookout for the Scarlet Raiders, and she is guarding the street when a group of children approach her. Judy warns them to leave, but one of the children goes around her and runs down the street. Suddenly, the police arrive, and Judy warns the gang, but then sees them jumping around and throwing their weapons and jackets. Again, the words \"The Scorpion\" are found on the jackets of both gangs. Stevenson brings this up to Hanks again, but he denies it and tells him to stop bringing the theory up.",
            "The story begins in a bank. It is under control of three bank robbers, who have taken nine other people in the bank hostage. One man escapes out the door, shouting for help. The robbers quickly run outside to meet their getaway driver, where they speed off. They are followed by police. The getaway car reaches ahead until the car crashes, and the police clap handcuffs on the robbers, taking them to the station. \nBack in the station Detective-Sergeant Stevenson discusses with his colleague what happened. The tires of the getaway car seemed to have melted. The car was normal, apart from the words \"the scorpion\", burned in big black letters on the trunk lid. They meet the owner of the stolen car at the station, who tells them that he never put that sign on the car. That was on Wednesday. On Friday, the Daily News is sent a crank letter from someone signed \"the scorpion\" who tells the paper to warn their readers that \"the scorpion fights crime\" and that criminals are not safe.\nJerome Higgins, a man from Brooklyn goes crazy and kills his wife and injures his sister with a gun. Both neighbours and police surround the house after his sister Mrs.Strober escapes the house. inside, Higgins goes ballistic, shooting at random. That is until Higgins runs out of the house, his hands and shoulder having severe burns. He is taken to get his wounds treated, and then to jail. On the gun, it is burned into the wood \"The Scorpion\". \nThe Sergeant and his Captain discuss these cases. Stevenson thinks that they must be connected, but the Captain tells Stevenson to stop looking into this fantasy, as they have nothing in common, and it's a mere coincidence. The Daily News received another letter of warning that was never published. \nIt is Halloween night. The gangs \"The Challengers\" and \"The Scarlet Raiders\" are getting ready for a fight. The two leaders of the gang have agreed to a knife fight over a schoolyard for territory. Judy Canzanetti is sent out by the Scarlet Raiders as a lookout for any kids or cops going by. She sees a group of kids, who she tries to divert, but when one of them escapes and runs in the direction of the fight, she is caught off guard. That is until she hears sirens, and goes to warn the gang. Before she gets there though, all the members of the two gangs jump around, throwing their weapons on the ground and taking off their jackets. It is explained later on by Steavenson that their weapons all of a sudden became freezing cold, as did their jackets, with \"the scorpion\" burned into the backs of them. The captain once again tells Stevenson to let this \"nonsense\" go, and it's nothing more than a coincidence. ",
            "The story starts with a bank robbery in late June. There are twelve people in the bank when it is robbed. The three robbers, who look like triplets, all wear the same outfits. One man draws a pistol while the other one takes the guard's pistol, Mr. Anderson. The last one takes a black satchel bag and fills it with money. Then, they join the fourth robber in a stolen car while the police chase them. It seems that they will get away, but the tires melt, which gives the police the opportunity to apprehend them. On Wednesday, Detective-Sergeant Stevenson finds it very strange, but Detective-Sergeant Pauling tells him it is common for plans to have these flaws. Stevenson mentions that the car has 'The Scorpion' burned into it just as the owner arrives. John Hastings says that he reported his car as soon as it was stolen. Stevenson is surprised that he would leave his keys in it, but Hastings says it is usually safe for him because he is a wine and liquor salesman. Hastings is angry at the police for melting his tires, but Stevenson says the police had no part in that. Both of them are confused by the writing on the car since it was not there before. On Friday, the Daily News receives a letter from The Scorpion that warns the readers of the paper because it fights crime. However, the letter is ignored and filed into the wastebasket instead. The second incident happens in early August when a Brooklyn man named Jerome Higgins goes berserk after failing a Civil Service exam for the third time. The crime is in Canarsie, in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. Mrs. Higgins and his sister, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, try to wake him up; Mister Higgins kills his wife and injures his sister with a hunting rifle. He then goes on a rampage, barricading himself in the house and shooting at anything that moves. Policemen, firemen, neighbors, ambulance attendants, and even two cameramen from the mobile unit are present. After one hour, Higgins plans to shoot at the camera, but he suddenly throws his rifle away. He then complains about his hands, which are severely burned, and Stevenson finds the words 'The Scorpion' present again. Precinct Captain Hanks tells him that his idea of an external force fighting crime out there is silly, while the Daily News receives a second letter from The Scorpion. The third case details a Hallowe'en rumble in a schoolyard. Judy Canzanetti is made to stand chicken, and she tells a group of kids in Hallowe'en masks to stay away from the schoolyard. The kid named Eddie dashes down the street, and the cops soon appear after. Stevenson tries to bring up how strange it is for both gangs to have 'The Scorpion' on their jackets when the conflict was a territorial war. Hanks refutes his points and tells him to stop worrying about any Scorpion nonsense.",
            "A bank is being robbed by three similar looking men. Picking a moment, one of the hostages, Miss English, rushes out, but she is stopped, while another captive, Mr. Anderson, manages to escape and call the police. The robbers hit Miss English into unconsciousness and run away. Police cars come and go in the wrong way, but surprisingly manage to capture the robbers after all. The stupid mistake of the robbers seems suspicious as the car's tires melted for no reason and the stolen car was very noticeable with \"The Scorpion\" written in the back. When the car owner comes, he is very angry and upset, and he mentions the inscription wasn't there before the robbery. Soon, a letter from \"The Scorpion\" is received by a newspaper, saying that the sender will keep fighting crime. About one month later, a clerk murders his wife from a rifle after going berserk. This man, Mr. Higgins, barricades himself at home and fires outside in defense, while his sister runs to the police and the neighbors call. After an hour of no success in arresting the man, he runs out himself with his hands being terribly burnt. The same detective who led the first case, Stevenson, comes to the scene, and sees an engraving \"The Scorpion\" on the rifle. Higgins' lawyer claims the inscription was put by his client, while the least denies it, which the lawyer uses to proclaim him insane. Stevenson holds on to someone else making those inscriptions while Captain Hanks denies the version. Stevenson keeps posing questions making the case strange, but Hanks tries to close the case with explaining everything as primitively as possible. Hanks orders Stevenson to forget his ideas of someone pretending to be a superhero and even threatens him reminding about a precedent. Another warning letter to the readers comes from \"The Scorpion\" to the newspaper, but it's not printed again. Another story takes place on Halloween, two gangs meet to fight for a school yard with knifes and chains. A fifteen year old girl Judy stands chicken on the corner during the fight and sees a bunch of kids heading home, she says them to go another way, but one kid sees the rumble and rushes there. Suddenly the cops come and the gangs do not hear Judy's warning, everyone is arrested. \"The Scorpion\" appears on the participants' jackets after the fight. Turns out the fight didn't happen as all the metallic weapons and leather jackets suddenly got extremely cold to hold. Hanks again finds an explanation - the kids threw all of these away not tore arrested. He again tells Stevenson to stop with this nonsense from the superhero books. "

During the schoolyard incident, Hank is extremely annoyed at Stevenson trying to connect more points to \u2018The Scorpion\u2019 and tells him that the children just had a silly brawl. He also warns Stevenson to stop thinking about these foolish ideas and return to doing his job in the precinct. \n\n",

He is determined to find out the truth and he is passionate about it, he is also emotional in proving his point and thinks a lot about the cases. Hanks simply wants to close the cases as fast as possible and Stevenson's guesses irritate him. He is not interested in other possibilities and has rather realistic explanations. He uses his position and authority to threaten Stevenson into shutting up and stopping irritated Hanks."

They are eager to test their new research and want the test subject to be Elliot Macklin, a well-known and attractive scientist with a reputation akin to Albert Einstein. Macklin experiences migraines and the two believe that their injection shot could cure them. The two want Macklin to participate because it could ensure that their research will have strong financial support.\n\nMacklin soon enters their laboratory and begins to ask about what they\u2019re looking to do with their research. Ferris and Mitchell discuss their theory with Macklin and how their supposed cure works. They mention to Macklin, to his dismay, that it has only been tested on animals. Macklin is skeptical and considers the injection too risky and initially does not agree to take the treatment. \n\nMacklin begins to start experiencing a migraine. As he suffers through a migraine, Ferris and Mitchell use the opportunity to try again to convince him to participate in the research. They further emphasize the very minimal potential risk. Macklin finally agrees to take the injection due to the immense pain he is experiencing. \n\nLater on, Mitchell is upset with Ferris for sharing their unverified results with the press. Ferris exclaims to Mitchell that the experiment with Macklin was a success and that he should not be concerned. The phone rings and Ferris answers it but quickly passes it to Mitchell. Macklin\u2019s wife is on the phone accusing them of giving her husband heroin as Macklin appears to be in a trance. The doctors are concerned by the news and decide to check on the test animals. They do not find anything of concern with the test animals and go to Macklin\u2019s house. Ferris does not seem worried to Mitchell as they wait to be let into the house. When they enter the house, an army Colonel meets them and expresses his unhappiness with their actions. \n\nAs the group heads into the living room, they greet an army physician that tells them that medically there is nothing wrong with Macklin\u2019s health the only difference is that Macklin is no longer a mathematical genius. The three go into the hallway and discuss how the experiment most likely went wrong. The Colonel becomes upset because Macklin was very important to many missions because of his invaluable research. Mitchell suddenly exclaims that he thinks that Macklin can be cured. \n\nHowever, Macklin overhears the possibility of a cure and protests receiving the treatment. The Colonel is upset at Macklin\u2019s reaction and tries to convince Macklin\u2019s wife to force him to be cured. Macklin\u2019s wife does not wish to go against her husband\u2019s wishes. They leave the house without convincing Macklin or his wife. Later on, Mitchell wakes up and calls Macklin. Mitchell attempts to get Macklin to trust him and goes about luring Macklin back to the laboratory by saying that he can help with the new types of worries that Macklin experiences. \n",
            "Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Ferris are preparing to test out their new medical breakthrough on world renowned scientist, Dr. Macklin. Their new injection that they have discovered will potentially cure Macklin of his incessant migraines, which plague the genius' daily life. Macklin is famed for being at the forefront of the research team that is almost finished developing a faster than light drive, to help the US army reach Pluto. The only thing in the way of the completion of this project could be Macklin's headaches. Mitchell and Ferris ask Macklin if he would like to be the trial patient for their new antidote, which they only have funding to test out on one person. The antidote consists of a virus that is injected into a specific spot in the brain, blocking off oxygen from entering, curing the patient of any headaches. After walking Macklin through the science behind it and Macklin signing some waivers, they deliver the treatment to him. \nThe next day, Ferris gives the story of their success with the Doctor to the newspapers, that is until they get a call form Macklin's wife. She tells him that her husband seems to be high on a form of heroin. To this the two scientists protest, but then go to check on their previous animal test subjects to see their state. All the animals tested appear fine, yet subdued. They decide to go and check up on Macklin. \nThey arrive at his house to meet a colonel at the door, who invites them into the living room, where Macklin is sitting. He has just been evaluated by the doctor, and it turns out that the vaccine has reduced his brain capacity, to the point where he is now a \"moron\". The oxygen that the brain has been denied has made Macklin stupid, almost childlike. The two scientists propose they can fix this quite easily, and they just need to reverse the treatment they gave him, which would return him to his original state. Both Macklin and his wife refuse this. Macklin wants to live a life without pain, and the thoughts about the universe that would keep him up worrying, late at night. His wife tells the men that she doesn't want to go against her husband's wishes, and if the US government wants to take the pair to court over it, so that Macklin might regain full consciousness and continue with his work on the Pluto project, the court would side in her and her husband's favour. \nThe men leave, defeated. That is until Mitchell wakes up in the middle of the night, and calls Macklin, convincing him that it's in his best interest to come to his lab, so that he might make him better. The colonel has given his wife a sedative, so she won't wake up. Macklin leaves to unknowingly go to have his treatment reversed. ",
            "The story starts with Steven Mitchell and Harold Ferris arguing over the candidate that they should test their discovery on. While Ferris suggests Mitchell to be the candidate, Mitchell points out that it wouldn\u2019t be ethical. He suggests that Elliot Macklin, the late Albert Einstein, has more reputation and his migraine is well known. He is the perfect candidate they have. After a knock on the door, Mitchell and Ferris invite Macklin inside. They introduce the injection and claim that his headache can be cured forever with this one simple injection. Macklin notices that they have not yet tested this on a human being, but they assert that it worked fine on rats and chimps. They explain their situation to Macklin, which is a lack of time and money. They have the resources to cure one person. However, Macklin is still suspicious of the injection. Mitchell and Ferris assure that there is practically no possibility of getting a low enough blood pressure to stop the heart. Along with another attack of the migraine, Macklin gives them permission to inject. \n\nMacklin\u2019s wife calls and blames them for giving her husband heroin. Being confused, Mitchell and Ferris look at the test animals and realize that the ones with injections are much more calmer and have less energy. They go to see Macklin. Macklin has become the healthiest, happiest person, but he also becomes a moron, namely not very intelligent. After Mitchell explains that he has the antitoxin to fix him, Carson demands them to give it to Macklin. However, Macklin refuses. He used to be worried all the time, but now he is peaceful. Since he is legally responsible, he can definitely refuse the antitoxin. Thus, they go to Mrs. Macklin, hoping that she will be able to persuade Macklin to take the antitoxin. She also refuses. Later, Mitchell calls Macklin pointing out that he is still doing a lot of thinking. Mitchell tells him that he can get rid of them if he wants. ",
            "Ferris and Mitchell are two biologists that are in the process of developing a cure to the common headache. They want to test their cure on Elliot Macklin, a well-known genius mathematician who suffered from a stroke and is victim to periodic migraines. Macklin arrives, and the two inform him of their plan. They want to create a cure to the headache using an injection of a virus that attacks pituitrin, which causes migraines. They have had no confirmation of success of their cure on humans, only animals, so there is uncertainty with their experiment. Macklin initially tells them that there is too much of a risk, and that too many people rely on him for him to take the risk. However, after some consideration, Macklin agrees to take the injection. Later on, Mitchell scolds Ferris after learning that he had released the story to the press, despite the results not being confirmed yet. They then receive a call from Macklin's wife, hsyterically accusing them of giving Macklin narcotics and claiming that he has been put under a trance. Ferris and Mitchell visit Macklin, where they meet a team of Army doctors and officials, and find Macklin to be in a mellow, relaxed state. The army doctor claims that Macklin is happy and healthy, but that the injection has caused him to become dumber due to a miscalculation. Ferris and Mitchell suggest fixing the issue by wiping out the virus, but Macklin refuses, not wanting to return to his previous state. They ask Mrs. Macklin, who wants to support her husband's best interests. The two suspect that she is jealous of Macklin's genius and wants to keep him subdued in his current condition. One night, Mitchell wakes and calls Macklin, asking him to come to his lab to fix him. "

They acknowledge during their initial discussion with Macklin that there is a potential risk with the injection, but they heavily downplay the risk.

They believe their virus is safe because it is able to target a specific area and remain stabilized within the brain cells. \n\nAfter they give Macklin the injection, they later receive news that he has become a moron and is no longer a mathematical genius.

Moreover, since the virus can be easily localized and stabilized, it will only affect the cerebral vessels. Other cavities of the brain will not be effected.

            "Orison McCall is applying for a job at the William Howard Taft National Bank and Trust Company. She is a government spy who has been selected from the Treasury Department to work at the bank. The man who she meets for the job is Mr. Wanji, the First Vice President. He dresses strangely compared to the regular banker. Mr. Wanji also speaks to Orison in strange slang and leaves her with the job of reading newspapers into a microphone. She takes her lunch break at noon, eats a tuna salad on whole-wheat, and returns to reading at her desk until five. Orison gets the job and notes that the bank is very bizarre. All of the workers wear earmuffs, and her only task is to read into a microphone. After her dinner, she goes home and waits to receive a call from Washington. At eleven-thirty, she receives a call from Monitor J-12 from the Department of Treasury. He asks Orison for a report but flirts with her slightly by calling her beautiful and kissing the microphone. The next morning, the bank President Dink Gerding personally welcomes her. She notes that he is as crazy as the rest of the bank, and he asks her out for dinner even though they have just met. Once Orison begins reading a copy of yesterday\u2019s Congressional Record, Auga Vingt silently comes and introduces herself. She threatens Orison to stay away from Dink, to which Orison agrees and tells her to leave. Then, Kraft Gerding introduces himself to her, and she threatens to quit because of how crazy this bank is. Orison then receives a call from Wanji, and he tells her to tell Dink that escudo green is pale. Although she is banned from taking the elevator to the upper floor, she takes the stairs to the seventh floor instead and is greeted by the sight of millions of spiders in pink liquid. Kraft threatens to toss her into the tank, but then Dink comes and rescues her. He crashes his fist into Kraft\u2019s jaw, and the perpetrators leave him and Orison alone. He explains to her that the creatures are Microfabridae and are more closely related to shellfish than spiders. She holds one, and Dink says that the company is raising them in secret because it does not have a patent. He lets her listen to the hymn of the Microfabridae and feed the tiny creatures. Orison swears that she can see Benjamin Franklin winking at her, but she believes it is nonsense. \n",
            "Orison is having an interview for the position of secretary in Taft Bank with its vice-president Mr. Wanji. The least is talking slang and wears furry earmuffs and a scarlet vest, not reminding a banker at all. Orison's job is to read into a microphone whatever she is given. After the first day, the new employee is feeling very confused with her tasks, her boss, everyone in the office wearing earmuffs and forbidden upper floors. Turns out she is to spy for Washington in this bank and she writes down her observations. Orison gets a food and a drink and heads home, waiting for a call from Washington. As she doesn't get it, she goes to bed and suddenly hears a voice.   They establish an every day time for the talks and Orison tell everything she saw. The person on the other end, J-12, flirts with her and hangs up. Next morning in the office orison meets the bank president, a handsome young man Dink Gerding. He praises her efforts and asks on a dinner that night. Later, an extravagant woman, Auga, comes in. She shortly warns orison against touching 'her' Dink, following it by serious threats. Right after Kraft Gerding, Dink's elder brother, comes to welcome Orison. He warns her against mixing work and pleasure as well, which makes Orison ask him to leave. Soon she gets a call from Mr. Wangi speaking a strange language. She decides to go up via stairway. On the seventh floor she finds a huge room full of tanks and sees green liquid with pink bubbles inside. The bubbles turn out to be millions of spiders and Orison screams rushing back. There she is captured by Kraft and two earmuffs, who ask about the reasons for her entering the room. Suddenly, Dink enters and frees her, he beats his brother, who knelt to Dink's rank, and everyone leaves except Orison and Dink. The least shows her Microfabridae and gives one to hold, explaining he is no spider, after Orison describes her intrusion as an act of curiosity. Dink embraces Orison and they listen for the singing of little creatures for a while, then they feed them and leave. ",

She is interviewed by the bank\u2019s vice president, Mr. Wanji, who acts like a racetrack tout. Though Orison\u2019s new job has a higher salary than the previous one, her job is very simple. She only has to read newspapers and fairy-tales to a microphone every day. After finishing a day of work at the Taft Bank, Orison reports what she saw to Washington. Since there has not been any calls, she decides to go to sleep. However, as she lies down, a radio in her pillow talks to her. She is surprised, but agrees to report to the pillow at 11:15 every day from then on. Easy work and high salary, suspicious earmuffs for some of the workers, restricted floors, they all make the bank seems oddly strange. The next day, Orison meets Mr. Dink Gerding who seems to have an interest in Orison and asks her out for dinner. Orison agrees. However, both Mr. Kraft, the elder brother of Dink, and Auga Vingt, who thinks that Dink is hers, warned Orison to keep a distance from Dink.\n\nLater, Mr. Wanji calls Orison and wants her to bring a message to Dink. This gives Orison a vague excuse to explore the higher floors. Through a stairway, Orison goes to the 6th floor, but the door is locked. The door to the 7th floor is not. She pushes through the door and enters. She first thinks that she sees Benjamin Franklin. She got so scared that she screams. Then, mistakenly thinks that the Microfabridae are spiders, which Orison was afraid of, she screams again. Then, the appearance of Kraft and two other men with earmuffs make Orison unable to leave. Kraft threatens Orison. Luckily, Dink appears and saves her from the situation. Orison learns about Microfabridae, which are useful for a secret developing commercial process. Whereas, they are secretly fed by the bank because of the problem of patent.",

He takes her inside the elevator of the building, where he tells her she is not to go past the fifth floor of the building. He takes her to her office on the fifth floor where she will be working. He tells her that her job is to read the paper, as well as different books into a microphone. It is then revealed that the real reason for Orizon's application for this position was to spy on the bank for the government. Mr. Wanji leaves her. Orizon reads into the microphone all morning, then breaks for lunch. She sees more men with earmuffs on the elevator, coming down from the upper floors. She comes back after lunch, and then heads home. \nOrizon arrives home in her apartment, where she waits for Washington to call her, asking for an initial report. At eleven thirty, she decides to go to bed, after having not received any call. Just then, an invisible voice breaks out in the room. It is coming from her pillow, a speaker hiding in it. It belongs to Monitor J-12 from the agency, asking her if she has anything to report. She briefs him on her findings from the day. The next day, Orizon is back in her office, where she meets the president of the bank, Dink Gerding. He tells her she is to be his confidential secretary. He asks her out to dinner and dancing, which she accepts. He leaves, getting in the elevator. Orizon is visited by Kraft Gerding, Dink's older brother, who also warns her not to get involved with Dink. \nOrizon continues to read, when half an hour later, she gets a call from Mr. Wanji. He tells her to pass on a message to Mr. Dink Gerding. She decides to use the excuse of passing on this message to Dink as a reason to explore the upper floors. She opens the door to an expansive room, flooded with light. There are steel tanks all around, filled with green fluid with tiny pink bubbles. She then realises that the pink bubbles are spiders. She screams, and backs into the arms of Kraft. His two men take her by the wrists. He threatens to throw her into the spider tanks if she doesn't tell him what she's doing there. She tells him she has a message for Dink. Dink enters the room, and the two men, including Dink's brother, drop to the floor. Dink goes to her, soothing her, then punches Kraft. He orders the three men to leave. He tells her that the spiders are not spiders at all. They are tiny frustrations called Microfabridae, who eat stone and metal. He tells her he can't explain what they do, as it's confidential. They listen as the tiny creatures sing. "

He looks to be around twenty eight, and very tall. Orizon notices how \"kooky\" he is due to his demeanour. He asks her to call him Dink instead of \"Sir\", unusual for a boss who has never met his employee. He then shows his forwardness by asking her out immediately. Later, when Orzion is being threatened by Kraft, Dink comes to her rescue. He holds Orizon, punching Kraft in the face, showing his chivalry.

Tremaine asks Jess if he has any idea of a transmitter in this area, however, Jess does not seem really interested in the transmitters as he think drawing is a beer advertisement. Afterwards, Jess tells Tremaine about the old man Bram who seems to have lived in this town forever. He is the mystery man of the town. As a foreigner who no one knows much about, he seems strange. Knowing that Bram has lived on the same property since as long as anyone could remember, he goes to the Municipal Office of Records to check the last time that there was a change of hands on Bram\u2019s property.  \n\nThen Tremaine goes to the Elsby Public Library, checking for the newspapers around the time when Bram bought the property. On his way back to the hotel that he is staying at, he notices Grammond\u2019s men. But Tremaine has told Grammond to keep his men away from this town for now. Apparently, Grammond didn\u2019t listen, Tremaine is afraid that with the police searching around the town, the person they are looking for will sense that something is off, and will hide before they are able to find him/her.\n\nDesiring to learn more about this old man, Jess has also mentioned to Tremaine that Linda Carroll had been with Bram for a while when Carroll was in her twenties, which is a few decades ago. So then Tremaine goes to Carroll\u2019s house hoping to learn more about the mysterious man Bram. Then after he left Carroll\u2019s house, he goes to Bram\u2019s house together with Jess.

Jimmy Tremaine visits an old acquaintance Jess in a local police department, the former shares details of his secret mission and asks whether Jess has any idea who can be the transmitter. Jess says everyone around is bad with technologies, but Mr. Bram is a mystery man, so it could be him. The man is a foreigner but he has been living in the town for so long that no one knows when and where he came from. Not long ago his house was set on fire by a bunch of kids, nothing serious. Jess tells a story about the past: a local beauty by then, Miss Carol, wanted nothing to do with locals and set her trap for Mr. Bram.

Tremaine heads towards the Elsby Town Hall, he learns that Bram bought his property in 1901. Then in the local public library he finds an article concerning this purchase, then he sees an article of July 7, 1900 regarding a severe thunderstorm. Near the hotel he notices a car and heads after the police to ask Grammond, the chief, to keep the police away from the hotel so as not to scare off the intermitter. Grammond is offended by being kept ignorant. Further, Jimmy heads to Miss Carol's and asks questions about Mr. Bram, she can't answer them for sure and a tear drops from her eye. Soon, she decides to tell about the night at Bram's place back in the years : he told he fought evil every night, went downstairs for the whole night and left her alone. Then he gave her a locket and said to press in a particular way if he is ever needed. Miss Carol considered him crazy and never met me again. She says Bram fears thunder and gives Jimmy the locket.

Tremaine tells Jess about the transmission and asks if he has any ideas or leads on the situation. Jess is stumped, but notes that Mr. Bram is an odd character at Elsby, who has been there for an unusually long amount of time. Curious about Mr. Bram, Tremaine goes to the Office of Record, where he bribes the man at the counter to tell him the year that Mr. Bram purchased his home, which is revealed to be 1901. The clerk also tells Tremaine that no one has seen Bram between sundown and sunup. Tremaine then visits the library, where he finds an article about Bram purchasing the house, as well as an account of a thunderstorm that occurred there a year before the purchase. On his way back from the library, Tremaine sees a police car speeding off, and he follows. He gets in contact with the State Police Chief, who does not approve of being left out of Tremaine's investigation. Tremaine speaks to Miss Carroll, known to have had a history with Bram. She tells Tremaine about her encounter with Bram and how he kept her in a cave under his house for the night, and she never spoke to him again. She also tells Tremaine that Bram is afraid of thunder. As Tremaine walks back to his room, Jess finds him and asks how the investigation is going, and Tremaine replies that he is stumped. Jess suggests that they visit Bram's house together, and the two enter and see an empty gun shell. They find blood in the kitchen. Jess and Tremaine then visit a police station where they find Hull Gaskin, who admits to shooting Bram after some cops prompted him to help catch spies. ",
            "Tremaine calls Fred from his hotel room and gives him an update on his progress. Fred expresses his frustration with the progress and complains that General Margrave has been breathing down his neck about the case. Tremaine tells Fred to be confident in him and Fred ends by yelling that he wants the transmitter and for someone to pay. Tremaine eventually leaves his hotel room and heads towards the local police station. At the station, Tremaine greets Jess once he enters the building. The two go to have a private conversation where Tremaine tries to get Jess\u2019s help with a case. Jess tells Tremaine what he knows about Bram from what he\u2019s heard and what he\u2019s seen. It is clear that Bram lives a very private life. \n\nOnce his conversation with Jess finishes, Tremaine goes to the Municipal office of Records at the town hall. He has to bribe a reluctant man in the office to let him look for the information that he needs. He is able to find out information about Bram\u2019s property and then leaves to go to the library to gather more information. At the library, Tremaine looks through old newspapers. He learns from one newspaper about a severe thunderstorm that affected the Bram property.  \n\nBack at his hotel room, Tremaine has a tense phone call with Fred. When it ends, he pours himself a glass of scotch. After finishing his drink, he goes to Miss Carroll\u2019s nearby house Tremaine asks her about Bram. She is unable to give him many details about Bram. However, Miss Carroll does willingly detail her personal relationship with Bram. Carroll mentions that Bram gave her a locket and to use it to contact him if she ever needed his help. Tremaine asks for the locket and she hands it over to him. She mentions that she remembers how Bram was afraid of thunder. With all the information that he could gather from Miss Carroll, Tremaine leaves her house.\n\nUpon leaving Miss Carroll\u2019s house, Jess pulls up to Tremaine on the street in his car and they decide to go check on Bram as he hasn\u2019t been seen in a while. The two get out of their car once they reach the property and inspect the outside of the house. They become alert by the suspicious state of the house, especially because of the empty shotgun shell that they find, so they retrieve a gun from the car for their safety. They start hearing strange noises once they enter the house, causing them both to become uneasy. Inside the kitchen, they spot a suspicious trail of blood and hear another strange sound. They decide to go to the police station to ask Hull Gaskin \u2013 one of the teens arrested for setting fire to Bram\u2019s property- some questions. Hull says that he was approached by cops asking him to help them find spies. He says he told them about Bram because he\u2019s a foreigner.  \n"

The Major and the Colonel hate each other, and it's clear from the get-go that the Colonel is setting the Major up for a trap. He tells Polk that the man's name is Joe, and that he has an affinity for Terran cigarettes. The Major travels to Venus to find this man, and complete the mission. When he arrives though, it becomes clear to him soon that every native Venusian is named Joe, and they all love cigarettes. Polk calls the Major from the office on Venus, asking for extra information, but the Colonel gives none. He has screwed him. The Major decides to look for this man regardless, as returning to Earth without having completed the mission could mean a demotion or a loss of job. He hires a guide to take him through the jungle terrain of Venus, obviously named Joe. As they spend weeks traveling through the jungle together they quickly become friends. They stop at various villages together, where they meet the locals, they chat on their walks and the Major tells Joe all about his past. After a few weeks, they arrive at a village, where a starship and the Colonel are waiting for them. He has a gun pointer and Polk, informing him he plans on killing him, because Polk ratted on Walsh when they were in the academy together about dozing off while he was on watch over a tank filled with uranium. Just before he goes to shoot the Major, he starts insulting the locals of Mars, and then natives in general. Joe becomes visibly upset. The story ends, and it's presumed that Joe will save the Major.

Major Polk arrives on Mars and immediately meets a Venusian named Joe, but he soon realizes that it is not the man in question. The Major goes into the Officer's Club, where the Venusian bartender is also named Joe. Perplexed, the Major realizes that every native on Venus is named Joe. He meets with Captain Bransten, who tells him that since becoming in contact with Terran men, the Venusians had picked up their mannerisms and behaviors, including their love for cigarettes. Major Polk realizes that the Colonel has sent him on a goose chase, in impossible search of a man. Major Polk calls the Colonel, who smugly assures him that he can find the man in the jungle. The Major decides to play along with Walsh's trick and find a man for the mission. He meets a Venusian tour guide to take him through the jungle, who he gradually befriends as they visit several villages. With still no luck finding the right Joe, Major Polk soon encounters Walsh aboard his ship flying above him.

The Major tries to gather more information but the Colonel only gives him vague answers with a grin on his face. So, with his orders, the Major heads to Venus. When he steps off the ship, he is greeted by a man named Joe. He is shocked because he initially believes it could be the Joe he needs. However, he soon realizes that it is not the correct Joe and asks to be directed to the Officer\u2019s Club. Once he gets inside and goes to the bar, the bartender introduces himself as Joe. \n\nThe Major realizes that Walsh played a trick on him. He\u2019s upset at Walsh for sending him on a petty, retaliatory trip. Frustrated, he heads to the Captain\u2019s shack, where he asks why everyone is named Joe.

He calls the Colonel and asks for more information on the Joe he\u2019s meant to find. The Colonel finds amusement knowing that Polk has realized his predicament. All the Colonel offers up to the Major is that Joe is somewhere in the jungle. In response, he asks for a guide to take him. As he\u2019s waiting, he thinks of the Colonel\u2019s intentions and how he should respond. The Major decides to go along with the trip and do his best.

They find themselves going from village to village with days turning into weeks spent in the jungle searching for a specific Joe. Joe smiles at some of the Major\u2019s complaints of the tedious nature of the journey in an unusual way during their journey. They eventually reach another village and Joe smiles very wide when he delivers the news to Major Polk. The Major notices that there are no natives in the new village. He sees the Colonel standing near a ship with a stun gun pointed at him. It also seems like Joe knew that the Colonel would be there. Walsh tells the Major that he is going to kill him. As they tensely converse with each other, Joe chuckles and is excited with glee during the conversation. However, when Mars is mentioned, Joe stops being excited and a frown starts to form on his face. Walsh begins to shout hateful words about natives when he realizes that Joe is a native. Joe changes his attitude and looks at the Colonel in confusion. \n",

Despite the fact that he has never been to Venus and Venus is not even in their jurisdiction, Colonel Walsh calls it a simple assignment and asks the Major to travel to Venus. After arriving on Venus, he immediately encounters a boy called Joe. However, this Joe is not the person that he is looking for. Before reporting to Captain Bransten, the Major decides to stop for a drink. He asks Joe to take him there. Somehow, this Joe realizes that the Major is new to this place after he tips him. After arriving at the bar, he meets two more Joes talking to each other, calling each other Joe. Neither is the one that the Major needs to find. Later, he learns from the Captain that the name Joe is just a culture here on Venus, and the natives all like cigarettes. This makes the Major furious since those are two of the few characteristics provided by Colonel Walsh. After chow, the Major calls Walsh, who is on Earth. After getting the information that this Joe is in the jungle, he asks a Joe to find him a guide for going into the jungle. Then, Major begins to realize that maybe Colonel Walsh didn\u2019t want him back since he is the next in line for command. He decides to be more careful. Following the guide, the Major walks from village to village, searching the natives for that particular Joe. The Major and the guide get close and become friend. However, the next village they visit does not have any natives, only Colonel Walsh. And Colonel is there to kill the Major."

            "The Colonel and the Major seemed as if they were acquaintances before they first fell out. The Colonel had called the Major, by his first name, Fred. Now, he only calls him Major, as a mark of disrespect, since the colonel somehow outranks him. The Colonel also demands that Polk use his proper title, as a way of putting him down. They initially fell out because one night, while the Colonel was supposed to be on boiled watch, guarding the uranium in a tank beneath the barracks, he fell asleep on duty. The entire barracks could've been blown up. The Major had to report him to their superiors. This meant that the colonel's career took a big hit, and he had to fight his way back into the ranks. He felt as if the Major betrayed him, and ratted him out. Now, the Colonel is in charge of Mars, where he has caused a revolt based on his shocking treatment of the natives. His prejudice towards the native people of Venus and Mars is another reason the Major hates him. ",
            "The Colonel and the Major attended the Academy together, and the two have despised each other since. At the Academy, Major Polk had reported the Colonel for falling asleep on duty, risking severe damage. Major Polk also holds reservations about the Colonel because of Walsh's treatment of natives, specifically on Mars after conquering the planet. He understands why there is a revolt against Walsh on Mars, given the way he degrades its natives. Colonel Walsh still holds reservations towards Major Polk since he reported him.",
            "Colonel Walsh and Major Polk have hated each other ever since they both went through the Academy at the same time. The Major does not like Walsh\u2019s attitude towards natives, especially how he treats them. From this, it is able to be discerned that Walsh has a very unfavorable attitude towards natives and regularly insults or hurts them. He also does not believe that the Colonel is understanding the severity of the current military situation. The Major also believes that Walsh does a bad job of managing the planet. The hatred that the Colonel has towards the Major is because the Major reported him for sleeping on the job while they were both at the Academy. The Major defends his reporting of the Colonel by arguing that the Colonel was supposed to be watching a uranium supply that was very dangerous and could have killed many people. \n\nThe Colonel appears to be threatened by the Major because he would be next in line of command if the Colonel is ousted from his position. The Colonel acknowledges that he is possibly failing at his job with the Mars issue and does not want to be demoted and for Major Polk to take over his job. \n",
            "The Major and Colonel were in the same Academy. But one time, the Colonel fell asleep on Boiler Watch. There was a pile of uranium that could\u2019ve blown up the whole Academy. When the Major caught this he reported him. But apparently, the Colonel still thinks that it is the Major\u2019s fault for reporting him. The Major also dislikes the way that the Colonel treats the natives. He calls them savages. The Colonel sends the Major to Venus and tells him a non-description of a man that he needs to find. This annoys the Major. He gets angry especially when he finds out that the description is completely useless since every man here names Joe and likes cigarette. The Colonel actually sends the Major here to kill him. "

Eventually leaving the Captain\u2019s shack, he goes to his sleeping quarters. After finding a guide, the Major and his guide head off into the jungle in search of a Joe. They go through a thick jungle, encountering different villages along the way. The jungle is so thick that occasionally, the guide has to use a knife to cut through the brush.

Polk finds that he really enjoys the company of the Venusian. He likes that Joe always seems to be happy, and knows just what to say to cheer Polk up. He admires that he's so friendly to the locals, and immediately chats and laughs with them. Polk soon begins speaking freely to Joe, telling him about his past, as Joe would listen with the sympathetic ear. They found that they hsa a lot in common. This is why it was shocking to discover that Joe was in fact working for the Colonel the whole time, leading Polk right to him, and right to his death. ",
            "The relationship between Major Polk and Joe initially starts out as strictly professional, with Joe guiding him through the jungle. As the trip progresses the two become companions, speaking to each other casually. Major Polk notes the passion Joe has for the jungle and how much he enjoys the trip, and says that Joe provides a refreshing and uplifting presence throughout the trip. The two eventually begin telling each other about their own lives, sharing stories and becoming friends.",

During their time together, the Major observes that Joe seems to really enjoy his job. Days into their journey, the Major is feeling very dejected by not making any progress while Joe seems to be very content. It appears Joe is always in a good mood and is not influenced by the Major\u2019s emotionally discontent. The Major notes that the relationship started off as an employer and employee constrained type but it soon became very friendly and developed to where they were sharing stories with each other. The Major increasingly talks freely with his guide. \n\nWhile the relationship appeared to be very friendly during the journey in the jungle, it appears that Major Polk should have not trusted the guide. The guide appears to have already known that the Colonel would be in a clearing waiting with a stun gun for Polk as he laughs during the beginning of their encounter. It becomes clearer that Joe planned this with the Colonel, and thus betraying the friendly relationship he made with Polk. However, Joe\u2019s attitude begins to change as he responds with a confused look towards the Colonel\u2019s remarks about natives and Mars. \n",

The Major starts to talk about Earth, the Academy, the Moon run, etc. And Joe is a great listener. Thus, they become friends. "

He then keeps meeting natives, all of whom are named Joe. He asks the Captain why all the Venusians are named Joe. The captain explains that it's because when the men of the Terran space program arrived they used their slang with the locals, all calling them Joe. The men would tell them that if they did a job for them, they would get a pack of cigarettes.

Burnside with a request for an asteroid that he would like to use in an upcoming wedding.\n\nBob and his partner Queazy set out to find the perfect asteroid for Mr. Burnside, although they know it\u2019s a longshot. Fairly quickly, they find one that looks perfect. The men land on the asteroid, and Bob deploys his atomic-whirl spectroscope to test it. Suddenly, a beautiful woman interrupts him and demands that they leave the asteroid. She pulls out her spasticizer gun before telling them that they can have it in a month after she\u2019s gone. Bob explains that they are desperate, but the girl retorts that her fate is worse than death if she leaves.\n\nSuddenly, the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship appears, and Bob tells the girl that they have to fight this enemy together. Wally and Billy Saylor, along with three other men, jump out of the ship. Bob tells them that Mr. Burnside has ordered this asteroid, and the Saylor brothers say that they received the same order. Bob quickly grabs the girl\u2019s spasticizer while Queazy throws his body at Billy. However, Wally manages to shoot the gun out of Bob\u2019s hand and attack him. Bob is knocked unconscious in the scuffle. \n\nWhen Bob wakes up, he is completely alone, floating in space. He panics because he has very little oxygen left. Finally, he hears Queazy\u2019s voice explaining that the girl used her ship\u2019s technology to find them both. The mystery girl introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, the granddaughter of Mr. Burnside. She concedes that this entire mission was fake. She told her grandfather that she would only marry her fiance Mac if he could get this particular asteroid, and then she made plans to conquer and protect the asteroid so it could not be supplied for the wedding. \n\nBob is confident that they can reach the Saylor brothers before they bring the asteroid back to earth, but his plan does nothing to protect Starre from marrying a man she doesn\u2019t love.

Within five days, Bob realizes he is in love with Starre. \n\nStarre compares her small ship to a yo-yo, and Bob gets an idea - they will use Starre\u2019s ship like a yo-yo to retrieve the asteroid from the Saylor brothers. Once the team catches up to the Saylor brothers, Bob flings Starre\u2019s ship at the asteroid several times, and Wally calls them to tell them that they might die as a result of the damage their ship has sustained.

Bob had invented this service, but his business is suffering thanks to strong-arming by their main competitor, the Saylor Brothers. They need to find Mr. Burnside's asteroid because the payout of $550,000 will save their business. When Bob and Queazy discover an appropriate asteroid, they land and survey the surface to check its dimensions and mineral composition. However, they are interrupted by a beautiful young woman who confirms the composition of the asteroid but demands they leave at once or else she will alert the Interplanetary Commission that they have broken the law. When Bob sees her dumbbell-shaped spaceship, he realizes she comes from wealth and becomes obstinate; he shares with her the importance of this asteroid to his business. While the woman acknowledges his situation, she says if she leaves the asteroid, she will face \"a fate worse than death!\" As they finish their conversation, the Saylor Brothers' ship arrives, and Bob informs the woman that they must stick together to stand against them. Bob argues with Wally and Billy Saylor and eventually he and Queazy attack the two brothers. In the ensuing fight, the Saylors use the woman's paralyzing spasticizer to disable the three rivals and leave them scattered and stranded to die in space. When Bob awakens, he realizes he is running out of air, but soon Queazy retrieves him in their ship with the woman's dumbbell ship in tow; the woman had saved Queazy and together they tracked down Bob. The woman reveals her name is Starre Lowenthal, and she is Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter. She explains she had concocted a scheme to avoid having to marry her fiance, Mac, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of her grandfather's: She said she would marry Mac if they could hold a wedding atop an asteroid with very unique specifications. Her grandfather then commissioned Bob's company as well as the Saylor's to ensure such an asteroid would be discovered. And Starre came to the asteroid to ensure that if someone did find it, they wouldn't be able to take it back with them. Although Bob is in love with Starre, he still needs the money for his business, so he decides to pursue the Saylor Brothers and retrieve the asteroid after all; he assures Starre that they will deal with her marriage issue later. Making use of his ship's ability to accelerate and decelerate extremely fast, Bob attaches Starre's ship to theirs and uses it as a kind of yo-yo to threaten and disable the Saylor Brothers' ship. They relinquish the asteroid, and Bob, Queazy, and Starre win the day.",

Burnside, of Philadelphia, has requested that Bob specifically source an asteroid for his backyard of an exact dimension and composition for a wedding on June 2nd. Having weddings on asteroids in backyards had become a fad among the richest people on Earth.\nWhen they land on the asteroid, they put on spacesuits and begin exploring and testing its composition. They\u2019re startled by a woman who is squatting on the asteroid and claiming she is protected by law to remain there. She is certain about not wanting the asteroid to move from its position, and even pulls a weapon (a spasticizer) on Bob to try to prove her point when he tries to plead with her that his livelihood depends on them taking the asteroid back to Earth. Just as Bob and Queazy were turning to leave the asteroid, the Saylor brothers landed on it.\nThe Saylor brothers were a rival operation to Bob and Queazy, and Bob says they are known for being rough to get their way. They landed on the asteroid with three other men, claimed they also had a direct order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and began an attack on Bob and Queazy. Bob made a diversion with the woman\u2019s paralyzing weapon, Queazy threw Billy Saylor off the asteroid into space, and Wally Saylor shot the weapon out of Bob\u2019s hand. \nBob was unconscious after the fight and woke up spinning in outer space running out of oxygen. With his last breath he called for Queazy on the intercom and was swiftly rescued by both he and the woman and revived to life. The woman revealed herself to be Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter,  Starre Lowenthal. She was squatting on the asteroid to try to stop its delivery to Earth. She told her grandfather that she would only marry the man he set her up with, Mac, if it was atop this exact asteroid - thinking that there was no way it was possible for it to be found, and if by small chance it was she would scare those people away.\n \nBob tells Starre they can still intercept the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship since they have to take a long slow orbit back to Earth while his ship can go direct because it\u2019s not towing an asteroid. Along the five day journey to Earth, Bob and Starre fall in love with each other, but Starre seems determined that she would have to keep her promise to marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered. They hook up Starre\u2019s dumbbell shaped spaceship that they are towing like a yo-yo and use it to bludgeon the Saylor brothers\u2019 ship, causing them to release the asteroid and jet away into outer space, leaving Bob, Queasy and Starre in possession.\n",
            "Bob Parker and his partner Queazy are searching for an asteroid of exact proportions to meet a client\u2019s demand. This job is very important because their company, Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., is in dire straits and likely to go under without the significant payday this asteroid will bring: $550,000. The client who requested an asteroid this size wants it for a wedding in his backyard by 11:30 am on June 2; otherwise, the order is void. Parker started the \u201casteroid in your backyard\u201d promotion, but since then, other companies have been offering the same service. Most notably, competition from Saylor & Saylor is hurting his business. Parker and Queazy locate the perfect asteroid that meets the exact specifications of the request, only to find that someone else, a beautiful young woman, already has laid claim to it. She orders them to leave and threatens to report them to the Interplanetary Commission or to shoot them with her spasticizer. Parker explains why the asteroid is so important to them, and the girl explains that if they take it, she will meet a fate worse than death. Then suddenly, the Saylors\u2019 ship comes into view and lands. Billy and Wally Saylor alight along with three other men, threatening Parker. So Parker tells them that he has an ethergram from Mr. Burnsides ordering this specific asteroid, but Wally announces that they also have the order. Bob grabs the girl\u2019s spasticizer while Queazy grabs Billy Saylor and hurls him into space. But Wally shoots the spasticizer out of Bob\u2019s hand, and someone hits Bob hard and knocks him out.\n\tWhen Bob regains consciousness, he is almost out of oxygen. He calls out for Queazy with his last breath, and Queazy responds and brings the ship to pick him up. The girl had rescued Queazy. She introduces herself as Starre Lowenthal, Mr. Burnside\u2019s granddaughter. Her grandfather wants her to marry Mac andwouldn\u2019tt take no for an answer, so finally Starre told him she would marry Mac if he could find an asteroid with specific dimensions and containing the minerals she specified. Bob knows the way the Saylors will have to take the asteroid into Earth\u2019s orbit and knows they can catch up to them. He tells Starre they have to do that to say the business, but they will work out her problem, too. \n\tAfter five days, Bob is in love with Starre, and she knows it. He starts to tell her, but she stops him because of Mac and the bargain she has to live up to. Bob says he thinks her ship is the solution, and she says it\u2019s just a big yo-yo. As Bob thinks about this, he devises a way to use her ship as a yo-yo to attack the Saylors\u2019 ship. They catch up to the Saylors and attack them with Starre\u2019s ship until the Saylors release the asteroid and fly away.\n"

Bob worries about the Saylor brothers from the beginning of the story, and he acknowledges that they do not always play by the rules. If Wally and Billy can make a buck by inconveniencing or cheating someone else, they will do it. The brothers are not only intimidating in terms of their business prowess; they are also described as giant when compared to Bob. \n\nQueasy and Bob have a legitimate order from Mr. Burnside for the asteroid, and they have no idea that the Saylor brothers have received the same order. Yet, they still worry that somehow, someway, their enemies will hear about the potential to make half a million dollars and try to steal their opportunity out from under them. Within moments of setting eyes on their spaceship, Bob tells Starre that they have to fight the Saylor brothers together. He doesn\u2019t know her at all, and she actually just pulled a gun on him, but he so deeply mistrusts Wally and Billy that it\u2019s worth it to take a chance on Starre.\n\nOf course, Bob turns out to be right.

Bob is truly close to death before his friends save him in the knick of time, and the Saylor brothers would be perfectly fine with that outcome. \n\nWally and Billy give Bob all the motivation in the world to try and steal the asteroid back, and Bob is determined to catch up with his rivals and make it work somehow. When he comes up with his yo-yo idea using Starre\u2019s ship, he shows zero empathy for the Saylor brothers. During his attempts to retrieve the rock, he seriously damages the brothers\u2019 ship, and they have the gall to call him and attempt to make him feel guilty about their desperate state. Bob, however, cannot be swayed. He knows that he found the asteroid first and that the brothers purposefully cast him out into space to die. His determination saves the day when the Saylor brothers are forced to dispatch Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid. \n",
            "Wally and Billy Saylor are boorish twin brothers who operate a company, Saylor & Saylor, that competes with The Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Company operated by Bob and Queazy. The Saylors have cashed in on Bob's \"asteroid in your back yard\" idea like many other companies on Earth, only they have been more successful. Thanks to their lack of business scruples, the Saylors have nearly put Bob and Queazy out of business. Because of this, Bob worries about them taking the asteroid that will net his company $550,000 if they catch wind of his arrangement. Unfortunately, the Saylors have also been hired by the same wealthy client that hired Bob and Queazy because the asteroid request was so unusual and specific, the client wanted to make sure it could be found in time for his granddaughter's wedding. Soon after Bob and Queazy meet the granddaughter, who is making temporary camp on the asteroid to avoid getting married, the Saylors arrive and paralyze the three of them in order to take the asteroid back to Earth and cash in for themselves. After they awaken and reunite, Bob, Queazy, and the granddaughter Starre, race after the Saylors and use Starre's ship as a yo-yo projectile. They damage the Saylors' ship and threaten to kill them so that they will release the asteroid. The Saylors threaten to call the Interplanetary Commission, but Bob is persistent, and he slams their ship again, causing them to give up the asteroid.",
            "The Saylor brothers are the antagonists of the story. They have an interplanetary moving company in competition with Bob and Queazy, and are known to be violent in getting their way. \nBecause Mr. Burnside was so desperate to have his granddaughter\u2019s wedding go on, he put the order out to both companies for this exact asteroid, causing the Saylor brothers to come into conflict with Bob and Queazy (who were also trying to deliver it to Earth), and Starre (who was desperate for it to not be delivered to Earth since she didn\u2019t want to get married). The Saylor brothers and three other men violently force all of them off the asteroid and into outer space to die and hurry off to Earth with the asteroid, which is the climax of the story.\nUltimately, Bob, Queasy, and Starre get justice by retrieving the asteroid after they intercept the Saylor brothers and attack their ship using a yo-yo method with Starre\u2019s spaceship they are towing, forcing the Saylor brothers to retreat into outer space.\n",
            "The Saylor brothers provide the conflict and competition that drives Bob Parker and Queazy to search the galaxy for an asteroid with the particular specifications Burnside requests. The Saylors are less-than-honest competitors with Bob\u2019s Interplanetary and Hauling Company. While Bob Parker came up with the \u201casteroid in your backyard\u201d concept, his competitors, especially the Saylors, soon offer the same service. Bob\u2019s company is on the verge of collapse and must fill Mr. Burnside\u2019s order if it is to survive. In desperation, they take on Burnsides\u2019s almost impossible order. When they find the asteroid, it is occupied by a young girl who turns out to be Burnside\u2019s granddaughter. As they talk with her to try to negotiate for the asteroid, the Saylor brothers arrive, trying to take the asteroid. In the fighting that ensues, the Saylors knock Queazy, Bob, and Starre unconscious, leaving them for dead, and take the asteroid. Bob is unconscious for three weeks, and when he comes to, he is down to five pounds of oxygen. Fortunately, Starre and Queazy find him and save him. Then they set sail for tracking down the Saylor brothers. When they find them, they attack the Saylors\u2019 ship with Starre\u2019s ship, using it like a yo-yo. The Saylors contact Bob to let him know they are losing air and that he is going to kill them; however, they refuse to turn over the asteroid. When Bob hits them again with the yo-yo, they finally give up, release the asteroid, and sail away.\n"

            "Bob Parker is taken with Starre Lowenthal from the moment she appears in front of him. Starre wears a spacesuit when Bob and Queazy land on her asteroid and begin conducting tests to see if it\u2019s a good fit for Mr. Burnside, and although Bob can\u2019t get a look at her entire appearance, he is immediately attracted to her blue eyes, beautiful brown hair, and full lips. The fact that Starre is curt and demanding does not change his innate attraction to her. Bob does not get offended by Starre\u2019s refusal to hold a real conversation with him; he just keeps trying. Even Starre\u2019s decision to pull out her spasticizer and aim it at the men doesn\u2019t truly deter Bob. He continues to try and convince her that his economic well-being depends on the asteroid. The only time he becomes annoyed with the beautiful girl is when he sets eyes on her perfect ship and assumes that she is already plenty wealthy. Still, he chooses not to attack nor namecall, he simply uses reason to convince her that the asteroid is more useful to him.\n\nMoments later, when the Saylor brothers show up at Starre\u2019s asteroid, Starre already has a good feeling about Bob and Queazy. That\u2019s why, when Wally and Billy attack the trio, it is Starre that uses her dumbbell-shaped ship to locate the men and save their lives. Bob and Queazy end up owing everything to the beautiful brunette. Without her, their corpses would be floating through space. \n\nThe first time that Bob sees Starre after she saves his life, he notices the paper flower in her hair and the pretty blue outfit she\u2019s wearing. He can\u2019t take his eyes off of her, and his feelings towards her do not change when she admits that she essentially set them up. She is Mr. Burnside\u2019s granddaughter, and she never intended to let anyone find the perfect asteroid and haul it back to earth. She set up a deal with her grandfather that she knew he couldn\u2019t follow through with. Starre does not want to marry Mac, the man that she\u2019s engaged to, and that\u2019s why she was living on the perfect asteroid that Mr. Burnside ordered from Bob and the Saylor brothers. \n\nAlthough Bob has every right to be angry with Starre, he completely falls in love with her on their mission to recollect the asteroid that the Saylor brothers stole from them. He tries to convince her not to marry Mac, but she acknowledges that she must hold up her end of the bargain with her grandfather. Unfortunately, Bob can\u2019t have it both ways. If he wants to save his company from going under, he needs the asteroid, and if he fulfills Mr. Burnside\u2019s order, Starre must marry Mac. \n",
            "When Bob first meets Starre on the asteroid, he is struck by her physical beauty, but the two of them do not get along. Starre reveals that the asteroid's mineral composition is exactly what Bob had been looking for to fulfill his client's request. However, Starre orders Bob to leave and says he can come back in a month. Although Bob doesn't know this yet, Starre wants to stay there for a month in order to avoid having to get married to her grandfather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mac and send away anyone who might come and try to take the asteroid back to her grandfather. Starre and Bob mostly have a strained relationship until they are both attacked by the Saylor Brothers and left for dead; Starre proves she is more than the spoiled, rich girl Bob thinks she is when she uses her own ship to save Queazy and then Bob. As they track the Saylor Brothers, Bob slowly falls in love with Starre, who seems to have an interest in Bob, too; however, she feels compelled by her obligation to her grandfather to marry Mac. Although Bob is unhappy that she cannot reciprocate his feelings, he still devises a plan to take down the Saylors and promises Starre they will come up with a plan to help her avoid the marriage. Starre seems pleased by this and encourages Bob as he implements his plan of attack against the Saylor Brothers.",
            "Starre Lowenthal is Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter. She is the cause of her and Bob meeting, since she was the one who ordered this exact asteroid to be delivered to Earth before her wedding - not thinking it would ever actually happen.\nShe rescues both Bob and Queazy after the Saylor brothers attempt to kill all of them by paralyzing them and tossing them into outer space. Starre is crestfallen that she now has to marry Mac, who her grandfather has been pestering her for years to wed. She thought she had the perfect plan to get out of it, but it had all fallen apart when the Saylor brothers were also given the order for the asteroid by her eager grandfather wanting to see the marriage go through. \nDuring the five day journey back to Earth together to intercept the Saylor brothers, Starre and Bob fall in love with each other. Starre provides the idea to make a yo-yo out of her spaceship, and they work happily together with Queazy to get the work done. Bob and Starre are equally elated when the Saylor brothers release the asteroid, though it is unclear what the future for them together holds.\n",
            "When Bob first sees Starre, he is struck by her beauty, but despite her plight, he is determined to take the asteroid to Earth and collect her grandfather\u2019s fee that he needs so badly. Initially, Starre is antagonistic to Bob and Queazy because she is staying on the asteroid to claim it and prevent anyone from taking it. If her grandfather gets hold of it, she will have to marry Mac, a fate she considers worse than death. After the Saylors\u2019 attack on all three of them, Starre and Queazy rescue Bob just as his oxygen is running out. They save his life, and it isn\u2019t long before Bob is in love with her. Starre realizes this, and just before Bob can profess his feelings, she stops him because she will have to keep her word and marry Mac if the asteroid is delivered on time. When Bob devises a way to use Starre\u2019s ship like a yo-yo to attack the Saylors\u2019 ship, he also tells Starre that they will work on a solution to her problem, too. It seems that Bob will try to collect Burnsides\u2019 payment for delivery of the asteroid but somehow prevent Starre from having to marry Mac. \n\n"

Bob is the president of Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., and his rivals, the Saylor brothers, have put his business in serious jeopardy. Although his novel idea to sell asteroids to wealthy earthmen originally made him some cash, it wasn\u2019t long before other companies got wind of his genius idea and started offering the same service. If the Saylor brothers keep beating Bob and Queazy to the punch, the men will no longer be in business.\n\nWhen Starre demands that Bob and Queazy leave her asteroid since she is the common law owner, both men try to explain to her why they desperately need the rock. The potential to make $550,000 means everything to Bob because his failure to secure that capital means that he and Queazy will lose their business and slave away for the rest of their lives as glass factory workers. \n\n",
            "Bob Parker created the idea of the \"asteroid in your back yard\", and since then it has become a fad sweeping Earth. As a result, a number of moving companies have emerged as competitors to Bob's Interplanetary Hauling & Moving Co., primarily Saylor & Saylor. The Saylor brothers engage in unscrupulous business practices and have crippled Bob's business to the point of desperation. Therefore, Bob and his business partner Queazy need to fulfill Mr. Burnside's extremely specific wedding-asteroid request for his granddaughter; successful completion of the order would net their company $550,000 and save them from financial ruin.

            "This mission to secure Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is so important to Bob and Queazy because it will pay them $5.00 per ton, which they estimate will net them $550,000. They look for it for three weeks before finding it, demonstrating how valuable this job is to them.\nSecuring the asteroid is also a point of pride for them, as they feel their business is threatened by the rival Saylor brothers, and the success of this mission would demonstrate their claim in the business of interplanetary deliveries.\n",
            "Securing Mr. Burnside\u2019s asteroid is critical for Bob\u2019s business to survive. He is having financial difficulty due to stiff competition, particularly from the Saylor brothers. The $550,000 from Mr. Burnside will help prevent his company from going bankrupt and going out of business. Burnside\u2019s order for an asteroid in his back yard is quite specific: it must be 506 feet long, 98 feet at the base and tapering to 10 feet at the apex, 9-12 feet thick, a smooth plane on the top side and a rough plane underneath. It must also be composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar. It has to be in Burnside\u2019s back yard before 11:30 am on June 2. The order is so specific that normally Bob and Queazy would not have accepted it, but since the business is about to fold, they are desperate and willing to try to fill it. When they find the asteroid in just three weeks, it seems they have had an incredible stroke of good luck, until the Saylor brothers show up to claim it, too. Filling the Burnsides order is a matter of life or death for Bob and Queazy\u2019s company, and they are prepared to do everything humanly possible to collect the asteroid and take to Earth.\n\n"

Ben is an orphan, and he wonders if the only person he invited, Charlie Taggart, is there. Ben met Charlie, an accomplished spaceman, when he was a boy, and Charlie took him under his wing. When Ben connects with Charlie after the ceremony, he worries about his gaunt face and terrible cough. \n\nBen then meets Laura, Mickey\u2019s sister. There is an undeniable and instant connection between them. Charlie only has 24 hours to spend with Ben before he has to report back for duty, and although he wants to have some drinks with Ben alone, Laura invites them both over, and Ben can\u2019t help but say yes.\n\nMoments later, Dean Dawson reminds Ben about an offer to teach at the Academy. Mickey takes this opportunity to admit to Ben that he will be working as a Supervisor at White Sands Port. Ben is disappointed to hear that Mickey has chosen to live a boring life, but Mickey insists that he does not want to die in his 30s. \n\nAfter dinner at Mickey\u2019s house, Laura and Ben take a walk together. Laura asks about Charlie\u2019s life before he was a spaceman, but Ben doesn\u2019t have answers for her. He doesn\u2019t know anything about Charlie\u2019s past. Ben looks at Laura and realizes that she has feelings for him, too. When she suggests that a career in deep space may not be worth what Ben would be leaving behind, Ben finds himself at a crossroads. Should he live his dream  or should he settle down with the woman he loves and live an ordinary life?\n\nThe next morning, Charlie gives Ben an old tin with souvenirs inside, and then tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a little cafe on Mars, when he gets there. Ben still hasn\u2019t chosen a career path and decides to stay with Mickey and Laura and their family until he does. He experiences forty days of happiness with his love, Laura, and forty nights of indecision about which career to choose. Ben asks Laura to marry him, but she says she can\u2019t unless he decides to stay on earth. \n\nThe next day, Ben receives a message informing him that Charlie has died from lung-rot, a disease he got in space. When Ben looks in Charlie\u2019s tin and finds useless trinkets, he decides  to take the teaching job so that he does not live a similarly meaningless life. However, hours later, he looks in the tin again and finds a wedding ring. Ben surmises that Charlie wanted to tell him to take the chance on space, and he believes it\u2019s the right decision to make. He can\u2019t live his life without knowing what the stars look like, even if that means he can\u2019t have Laura too. \n",
            "Spacemen Die at Home is a story in the form of a letter written from Ben to Laura, explaining his decision to leave her behind on Earth. It all begins in June of 1965 in New Mexico when the first class of the U.S. Academy of Interplentary Flight is finally graduating after six years. These 25 students were trained to take on interplanetary flight and space exploration, so they can continue to discover the outer planets. Robert Chandler gave a speech detailing why these brave men were so important to modern society, as women were not allowed to become space explorers. Mickey and Ben, graduates and friends, sat next to each other during the ceremony. Mickey struggles to find his family in the crowd, and Ben reveals that he was orphaned after his parents died in a rocket crash. A spaceman named Charlie Taggart (Stardust Charlie) raised him instead. He was one of the oldest spacemen ever, having travelled for nearly 25 years, and was the Chief Jetman on the Lunar Lady. \nAfter the ceremony, Ben runs into Charlie and sees how much he\u2019s aged in just a year. He looks ill and drugged, but he still asks Ben to celebrate with him. Before Ben can respond, Mickey and his sister Laura came up to him. He is instantly attracted to her and feels a connection. Ben was supposed to spend the weekend with Mickey and his family, but now that Charlie\u2019s in town he feels conflicted. Both Ben and Charlie decide to join them, despite Charlie not being a family man. Dean Dawson, an academy professor, approaches Ben and reminds him of his job offer at the Academy. Ben turns him down laughing, until Mickey reveals that he is not going to space anymore. Instead, he\u2019ll be the Cargo Supervisor of White Sands Sport. After an awkward dinner together, Laura and Ben went stargazing and spoke of Charlie and the draw of space. Laura hints at loving Ben, but doesn\u2019t say it outright. Charlie left the next day, but left Ben some of his possessions. He knows he hasn\u2019t got much time in this universe, but he goes back to Mars anyways. \nWith several job options to choose from, Ben decides to stay at Mickey\u2019s house for the timebeing. He stays for 40 days and nights, spending much of his time with Laura. He asked Laura to marry him, but she says she\u2019d only marry him if he were a teacher, not a spaceman. Ben was faced with a serious conundrum. The next day he received word that Charlges Taggart died of lung-rot, and Ben broke down. Ben sifted through Charlie\u2019s possessions and decided to take on a the teaching gig for Dawson. However, after looking through the box again, he found a wedding ring. Seeing himself in Charlie, Ben decided to fly to the stone cafe on Mars called the Space Rat where Stardust Charlie said he\u2019d be waiting for him. \n",
            "Nearly the entire story is a recollection of the narrator, Ben, as he writes a letter to his love, Laura, who he is leaving behind for his dreams of becoming a spaceman.\nIn June of 1995, Ben and Mickey are sitting together during their graduation ceremony from the first class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, looking at out at the audience for their guests. Mickey is cheerful and generally accepts the world with a smile. Ben\u2019s invited guest, Charlie Taggart, is a pioneering spaceman of 25 years who he thinks of as a parental figure since his parents died in a strato-jet crash when he was four. Ben and Mickey both spot their guests, and there is a contrasting moment between Ben\u2019s orphaned upbringing and Mickey\u2019s family.\nCharlie looks different from the other guests, with scars on his face, and a missing button on his suit - known for doing things his own way. Charlie is a veteran of the explorer Everson's first trip to the Moon, and he had spent his life in space. Mickey introduces Ben to his sister, Laura, after the ceremony. Since Mickey has invited Ben to spend the weekend with them, Laura goes a step further to also invite Charlie, which they both accept. Charlie leaves after one night, gifting Ben a tin box of \u201csouvenirs\u201d from his life, foreshadowing his imminent passing.\nAlthough Ben and Mickey both graduated from the school of interplanetary flight, they have both been offered terrestrial jobs. Ben was offered a job teaching Astrogation at the Academy by Dean Dawson. No doubt very prestigious, but Ben dreams of being the first to visit new planets with Mickey. Mickey awkwardly reveals he had a change of heart, citing that spacemen have short lives because of the demands and danger. Mickey was offered a Cargo Supervisor role at the White Sands Port that he accepted because he will \u201clive a lot longer\u201d there.\nBen is deeply uncertain about his future, accepting Mickey\u2019s offer to stay until he figures it out. During the forty days and forty nights he spends with them he falls in love with Laura and contemplates a family life on Earth with her - even proposing marriage to her - but his desire to be a spaceman remains a barrier to them being together. After Ben learns of Charlie\u2019s death (at \u201chome\u201d on Mars), he remembers the box Charlie gave him. At first he thinks it\u2019s pitiful that there are trinkets in place of the family Charlie might have had on Earth, and makes a decision to take the teaching job and remain on Earth in a safe life with Laura. \nProcessing the contents of the box further, seeing a wedding ring Charlie left for the marriage he couldn\u2019t have due to his life in space, Ben is inspired to again chase his dream in space. He leaves behind the wedding ring and a note (the story) for Laura to find in the morning when he is gone.\n",
            "This story is a letter from Ben to Laura, and starts with Ben's retelling of his graduation day from the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, with inspiring quotes from the guest speaker about how important spacemen are to society. Ben and his friend Mickey looked around for the one person Ben had invited: Charlie Taggart, aka \"Spaceman Charlie\". They spotted him, and Ben was relieved; the three of them went out afterwards to celebrate along with Mickey's sister, Laura. Ben explained that he'd been offered a teaching job at The Academy but wanted to join an exploratory crew. After getting to the helicopter, Ben eventually met Laura and Charlie's parents--simple people who were happy to live on Earth and not be going anywhere any time soon. Charlie did his best to interact with these new people, even though he told some disturbing stories. Laura and Ben headed to the terrace to look for rockets and talked about Charlie; Laura had a lot of questions about his past. They shared a quiet moment, appreciating each other, before Laura made a comment about the desire to go to the stars might be a disappointment: if they weren't what they seemed, maybe they would never be enough. She asked Ben if he really wanted to give up everything he could have, making Ben sad. The next morning, Charlie returned to work and left a box of belongings with Ben; it was only then when Ben became worried about the coughing he'd noticed over the past day, and his glassy eyes and stiff movements. Before they could talk, Charlie was gone. Later, in Mickey's room, Ben reflected on how his childhood was different from that of other children, after his parents died in a rocket crash. It was after this that he realized he wasn't sure if he wanted to stay or to go, and agreed to stay with Mickey's family until he made a decision about what to do. He spent most of the time with Laura, and after forty days of this he proposed to her, prompting her to ask what he wanted to do for his job. She didn't want to marry someone who would be absent, or someone in such a dangerous profession, but would feel better if he stayed and worked as a teacher, because she loved him too.  It was the next day that Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. Shocked, he looked through the box of belongings that Charlie had left him, and after seeing what little Charlie had left behind in terms of meaningful connections, he called The Academy to accept the teaching job. In the end, though, Ben recognized that he would never be happy without trying to explore the stars, so he tells Laura he will not be around when she wakes up because he has to see what's out there, and takes Laura's wedding ring and that of Charlie's wife with him, as mementos.

            "Ben experiences a lot of anxiety at his graduation from the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight because of the high expectations he perceives that the audience has of the 25 men who are graduating. The students have spent the last six years of their lives dedicating themselves to learning about minerals, metals, colonization, and space travel for the sake of helping the people on Earth. The class of 1995 is the first of its kind, and the family members and friends who attend the graduation understandably have very high hopes for the graduates. The graduation speaker is Robert Chandler, a spaceman who landed a rocket on Mars and created the first colony there. He has also traveled to Venus twice. For most laymen, accomplishing something as adventurous as landing on other planets is unthinkable, and the men graduating are the next in line to make such unthinkable journeys. \n\nBen looks out over the crowds of people and thinks to himself that these strangers are looking at him as if he\u2019s some sort of god. He knows that they expect the world from him and his fellow graduates, and he worries that he won\u2019t be able to deliver on such incredible promises. \n\n",
            "Spacemen are highly valued and, in some ways, superior members of society. Only a very small group of people were selected to attend the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, which shows how selective and exclusive these members of society are. Although their work is valued and fawned over, those who work in space are often killed early on in their careers. The mortality rate is extremely high in this job and increases with every trip taken. With such a dangerous reputation, the family members of spacemen see the darker side of it: solitude, fear, and sadness. ",
            "Ben reflects on the pressures of being a spaceman during graduation, that there is a lot expected from them; such as making \u201ca new kind of civilization and a better place out of Earth.\u201d \nAs Ben and Mickey talk about their futures, Mickey reveals he is no longer going to become a spaceman because their lives are short. Mickey reveals for the first time in the story the dangers of the job, the exposure to uncertainty and hazards, and the demands it places on a human body.\nAlthough it is a high pressure, dangerous job, being a spaceman is romanticized through Ben\u2019s childhood dream while he ultimately commits to see through at the end of the story. The allure of adventure in space and seeing the unknown for himself is a stronger draw than a safe life of certainty on Earth.\n",
            "In the speech that Robert Chandler gave to the first graduating class of the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight, he reminded the students that the six years of training would pay off for society, and that these spacemen would retrieve metals and minerals that the people of Earth needed, find new land, and inspire others, all of which were necessary things for the society. However, Ben and Mickey know it can be a dangerous profession: Mickey explains that on the more dangerous missions, where one is one of the first on a planet, you're lucky to live five to ten years. This is important because Laura has this knowledge when she talks to Ben about their possible future together. She knows that he could die, their children could be exposed to dangerous radiation, and he would likely always be looking for the next adventure instead of coming home to her. In general, the spacemen are appreciated for their services to the society but there is some understanding of the limitations on the types of meaningful personal connections they are able to make."

Within a few years, he meets Charlie, a successful spaceman, at the Long Island Spaceport. He follows him around, eager to learn everything he can about space, and Charlie eventually becomes the closest thing Ben has to a family member. \n\nAlthough Ben doesn\u2019t know if Charlie will show up at his graduation, he is happy to see he has taken 24 hours off of work to come and celebrate with him. He worries, however, that Charlie looks very ill. He becomes even more concerned when Charlie leaves a small tin for Ben to look through after he leaves. Charlie admits that he has cheated death many times, and he knows he won\u2019t be able to escape it forever. Ben remains hopeful that they will see each other again when Charlie tells him to meet him at the Space Rat, a cafe on Mars. \n\nAfter Ben receives word that Charlie died from lung-rot, he takes it as a sign that he should stay on earth and live an ordinary life with Laura as his wife.

Ben realizes that Charlie\u2019s life may not be one that\u2019s suitable for everyone, but it was certainly a life worth living. Charlie returned to space knowing that he was about to die because the planets and moons and stars were his reason for living. To Charlie, the sacrifices he made to be a spaceman were worth it, and Ben sees that he wants that for himself as well. \n",

At first, he decides to stay so he can marry Laura and live a long and happy life with her. He didn\u2019t want to die alone like Charlie. However, after discovering a wedding ring hidden in Charlie\u2019s possessions, he realizes that despite Charlie\u2019s solitary lifestyle he was never truly alone.

He had aged much in the year before Ben's graduation, but did show up to the ceremony, ready to celebrate with Ben. After a day of celebration, Charlie left a box of belongings with Ben as he went back to work. It was then that Ben started to worry about Charlie's health. After spending forty days with Mickey's family trying to decide what he wants, Ben got the news that Charlie had died from lung-rot. When Ben looked through Charlie's possessions, he realized that there was a lack of evidence of real human connection, and this pushed Ben to call The Academy and accept the teaching job so that he could be with Laura and not run away to the stars. At the same time, Ben reflected on the stories he had been told and the life Charlie had lived. Charlie had been married, but learned the hard way that he could not have both a family and the stars.

            "Ben becomes an orphan when he is just 4 years old. The first person he finds that he can trust and look up to is Charlie Taggart, who also happens to be a spaceman. From this point forward, Ben\u2019s life revolves around reaching his dream of going to the stars. When he sits in his best friend Mickey\u2019s childhood bedroom, he realizes that he never got to experience a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood, and this probably impacted his life\u2019s goals. The bedroom contains trophies, books, videos, and other treasures from typical childhoods. Ben sees that his life, filled with dorms, rules, and routines, completely lacked a warmth that he would have experienced if he had grown up with parents who loved him. All he had to rely on were his dreams for his future. He never got to experience the little moments of pleasure and togetherness that families have. Ben put all of his energy into becoming a spaceman because it would make him special, and it was something supremely important to work towards. He has no idea who he would be if his parents hadn\u2019t died. ",
            "When Ben was a child, his parents were tragically killed in a rocket crash, leaving him orphaned and alone. Although the story doesn\u2019t reveal the exact circumstances or series of events, Ben eventually winds up in the hands of Charlie Taggert who looks after him as a father, mother, and brother. Charlie\u2019s devotion to space inspires a love for it in Ben and sets him on the path to interplanetary flight. Without Ben\u2019s parents dying, he may never have met Charlie or attended the U.S. Academy for Interplanetary Flight. \nAs well, his childhood prepared him for a life of solitude. He was not a family man by nature or by nurture, which made his ascent into space much easier. \n",
            "Ben\u2019s parents both died in a strato-jet crash when he was four, leaving him with no mother and father. He realizes while he is an invited guest staying with Mickey and Laura at their parent\u2019s house after his graduation that they had a childhood different from his. Their childhood bedrooms and their upbringing was something that he all of a sudden felt he was lacking due to his experience growing up in dormitories with rules and regulations. He cites that his singular focus on his dream to be a spaceman didn\u2019t allow him to stop and notice the things that he felt he missed in his childhood.\nThis childhood of separation from family, and attaching himself to a pioneering lone-wolf spaceman (Charlie) after pestering him while he was a child in a spaceport, led Ben to romanticize and want a life of opportunity to be the first to see new planets. That dream, and the independence he had known since childhood ultimately led him to choose a life in space instead of settle into a family on Earth with Laura.\n",
            "One major event in Ben's childhood changed his life in a large number of ways. His parents died in a rocket crash when he was young, which caused two immediate effects: Ben's lack of parental figures in his life, which spurred his interest in Charlie and causes his childhood to be irregular in other ways, and Ben's general interest in rockets. In this way, rockets have affected him at various stages in life: he would have lived a very different life if they didn't exist, because his parents would not have died, but he would not have had them to attach his big dreams to either, which means that maybe he would have been perfectly happy staying on Earth with Laura in another version of events. He had to clutch onto his dreams as he was growing up because everything he saw was structure. As he put it, it was a \"cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and routines and rules\". His dreams of going to the stars, then, were his way of escaping this structure. He would never have applied to the U.S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight otherwise. "

Although he\u2019s happy to see Charlie Taggart, the closest thing he has to a family member, he chooses spending time with Laura and her family over spending time with Charlie alone. He can\u2019t help feeling drawn to her. \n\nAt first, Ben is completely oblivious to the feelings that Laura has for him, but after a walk under the stars together, he sees that she also sees a future with him. He has never before considered living on earth, getting married, owning a house, and settling for a \u201cboring\u201d life, but after she suggests that visiting the stars might just be like her trip to England, he wonders if she\u2019s right. Maybe he has hyped up space travel so much and it will end up being a disappointment. Maybe Mickey is onto something, and sacrificing a normal life on earth where living to old age is expected is not a choice he should give up so easily. Ben desperately wants to be with Laura. He loves her just as much as he loves the stars. \n\nHe spends forty incredible days with the woman of his dreams, but in the end, it\u2019s not enough to convince him to give up his lifelong dream of being a spaceman. Sure, he\u2019s uncomfortable with the amount of pressure that\u2019s put on him, and he recognizes that he will be risking his life every single day, but he can see that Charlie does not regret giving up the quiet homelife for the incredible adventures that await in space. Ben wants to be the first man to visit a planet or find a helpful mineral or create a useful colony, and his love for Laura cannot change his dreams.\n",

She says that she will marry Ben the teacher, but not Ben the spaceman. She does not want to be resigned to a life of solitude, fear, and separation. Ben is forced to make a choice then: Laura or his dreams of being an explorer. Although at first he decides to stay with Laura and become a teacher, he quickly changes his mind. In some ways, he has already married space and is as devoted to it as he was to Laura. He says in the end that he will always carry Laura and Charlie with him wherever he goes, though they may not be there with him physically. Although there was the potential for marriage, it seems that it was not meant to be. ",

Laura is the sister of his fellow spaceman, Mickey, whom he has become close with during training. Laura learns about Ben before she meets him from the stories told to her by her brother Mickey. When they have Ben and Charlie to their parents house for the weekend, Ben and Laura spend an evening after dinner watching for crimson-tailed continental rockets taking off from White Sands port. It was then that Ben knew Laura liked him.\nMickey invites Ben to stay with them until he decides what to take as his next opportunity - a berth on the Odyssey spaceship with the potential to go to Pluto or a safe job teaching astrogation at the academy. He stays forty days and forty nights. During this time, he falls in love with Laura and proposes to her.\nTheir relationship changes when Laura questions what a life would be like married to Ben as a spaceman. She has fears about bearing children with a spaceman since there was an example of one family having a \u201cmonster\u201d child after the father was exposed to radiation in space. She is worried about not seeing her husband for months or years at a time. Ben is torn between the woman he loves and the life he has been dreaming of since childhood to become a spaceman.\nUltimately Ben decides to be a spaceman and leaves Laura the wedding ring in Charlie\u2019s tin box (that was from Charlie\u2019s broken marriage after choosing life in space) as a token of his affection, and of the bittersweetness of having to leave behind a potentially happy life for his love of space. Perhaps Ben one day hopes to return and have Laura still waiting to marry him.\n",

She invited Ben and Charlie to celebrate with her and Mickey after the ceremony, and gives away the fact that Mickey is no longer planning on signing up to be on a rocket with Ben, and wants a safer job. Ben realizes later that night that he and Laura have feelings for each other, so this is motivation for him to stay with Mickey's family while he sorts out what he wants to do. The two spend forty days together before Ben proposes to Laura, who has been trying to figure out what Ben wants for the entirety of their relationship. This is the entirety of their relationship as of the time of the story, starting with their realization of an attraction and an interest in each other and ending in a proposal (that was presumably accepted) and then a breaking-off of the relationship. They both want to be with one another, and Ben wants to get married no matter what, but Laura knows that he cannot live as a spaceman and as a caring and attentive husband to her, so he must choose. In this sense, Laura's outlook is very steady for their entire relationship, as she asked Ben on the first night they met if he really wanted to become a spaceman if it meant giving up everything he could have. A lot changes in the last day or so of Ben's stay with the family, as he receives news that Charlie passed away. It looking through Charlie's belongings that he recognizes that he can't have the space life and the meaningful personal connections he might want (at least of the sort he had with Laura at the time), which makes him come to a snap realization that he should accept the teaching job and stay on Earth. However, his eventually falls to his gut which tells him he would never be happy if he never tried to see the stars, and that his relationship with Laura has to end.

He recruits alien life forms to exhibit at the zoo, and relatively quickly signs eleven new specimens onto his current 690 that are under contract at the institute on earth. This is a viable business because the World Congress declared Earth off-bounds to aliens in 2903, and the only way aliens can now go to Earth is as exhibits in this zoo.\n\nAliens make great sacrifices to come interview with Mr. Corrigan, as it seems he offers them a good deal.

Mr. Corrigan is slightly frazzled by the story, but ultimately asks the Stortulian to leave, feeling sad and that he may commit suicide upon leaving and losing hope for his wife to return.\nVallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV, was another notable interview. He stormed in and demanded to be signed to contract - and Mr. Corrigan preferred to make his own decisions. Herald felt insulted that the only four Kallerians at the institute were from the Clan Verdrokh, with no representation at all from his Clan Gursdrinn. Corrigan insisted he was unable to take another Kallerian, and apologized for insulting Clan Gursdrinn. This was enough to de-escalate physical violence, but Heraal was not pleased, and had to be escorted out of the room by Auchinleck and Ludlow who were summoned when Corrigan pushed a panic button under his desk.\nIn a surprise twist from what Corrigan had expected - the Stortulian to kill himself, and for Heraal to try to kill him - the opposite happens. Heraal storms in and stabs himself with his own sword, killing him instantly. The Stortulian returns and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, who is narrowly saved by being tackled by Gorb. The Ghrynian cops attempt to place a $100,000 fine on Corrigan for causing the death of a being (Heraal, who killed himself after being refused a contract). Gorb offers to get Corrigan out of the situation for $5000 and a contract to the institute, which is accepted.\n",
            "Mr. Corrigan, of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, is visiting MacTavish IV (Ghryne) in the Caledonia Cluster for a few days to hold interviews for new specimens to be featured in his zoo. All life forms, aside from Terra, were banned from ever visiting Earth since 2903, so the only way to get in is to be viewed for science, hence the zoo. The Institute has 690 specimens currently, encompassing 298 life-forms. He brings his men with him, Auchinleck, Stebbins, and Ludlow, to help calm the masses. His first applicant of the day walks in: a round creature with five eyed-arms and two legs. He introduces himself as Lawrence R. Fitzgerald of Regulus II, showing himself to be a Terraphile. Corrigan signs him on for half the normal pay and sends him on his way. A urisinoid from Aldebaran IX is next, but Corrigan has no need for another one. He signs a creature from Donovan\u2019s Planet, since they are such crowd-pleasers, and nine more. He also turns down at least 87 other life-forms, only of which, a Vegan, he feels remorse about. \nHis last specimen before lunch seems to be an Earthman pulling a con. He calls himself Ildwar Gorb and claims he\u2019s from Wazzenaxx XIII. Corrigan doesn\u2019t believe his tale and sends him out, though Gorb promises he\u2019ll change his mind before long. \nAfter lunch, trouble starts to arise. A Kallerian comes in and demands a place in his zoo, even though they already have four. Vallo Heraal of Clan Gursdrinn feels Corrigan has insulted his clan by only hiring members of Clan Verdrokh. Corrigan tries to calm him, but nothing can assuage his anger. He presses his trouble button, and his men come in and take Heraal away. \nA small alien runs into the room, sneaking past Stebbins, and begs to be brought to Earth so he can reunite with his soulmate, a previously hired Stortulian. She ran away from him when she got the opportunity to live on Earth, and, per Stortulian customs, the Stortulian was not allowed to remarry. \nCorrigan turns him down and continues on with his day until Gorb arrives again. He snuck past his men and offers himself as staff. Corrigan says no, but just then the Kallerian comes crashing in and commits hara-kiri, killing himself in front of the crowd. The police enter and claim Corrigan was the cause of his death since he had just filed a complaint against him. He can either be arrested or fined $100K. Next, the Stortulian walks back in and claims there is no reason to keep living. Unlike the Kallerian, he attempts to murder Corrigan by shooting his gun. However, Corrigan is shoved out of the way by Gorb. The Stortulian is arrested, and his actions are explained by Gorb. \nCorrigan decides to call his lawyer, but Gorb offers him a deal he can\u2019t refuse. Five thousand dollars as well as a contract, and he\u2019ll get Corrigan out of trouble. Corrigan agrees. \n",
            "J.F. Corrigan is the proprietor of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science, a glorified Terran zoo that offers spectators a glimpse at several hundred species of non-terrestrial life forms from all over the galaxy. Corrigan prides himself on actually employing his exhibits rather than hunting them down. Because Earth had closed its borders in the 29th century to non-terrestrial visitors, getting a job at Corrigan's zoo is a popular way for non-terrestrials to visit the planet and make a decent living at the same time. Corrigan offers good pay, short hours, and cover transportation costs and other expenses. Although he is generous, he is also thrifty and not above conning the public in the name of advancing his business. Corrigan arrives at the planet Ghryne to interview potential new non-terrestrials for his exhibition assisted by his employees Stebbins, Auchinleck, and Ludlow. He interviews dozens of non-terrestrials from planets all over the galaxy, including Mr. Lawrence R. Fitzgerald, a self-described Terraphile from Regulus II who wants to go to Earth so badly he is willing to work for less pay. Next, Corrigan meets Ildwar Gorb, a non-terrestrial from Wazzenazz XIII who looks remarkably like a human and claims to communicate through telepathic projection. Because of this similarity, Corrigan suspects him of actually being an Earthman attempting to con him for a free ride back to Earth. He dismisses Gorb, who implores him to reconsider and promises to return. After Gorb leaves, a Kallerian named Vallo Heraal enters and demands Corrigan hire him immediately or he will cause trouble. Wary of the Kallerian's size and threats, Corrigan fingers the meshgun trigger hidden under his desk in case he needs to protect himself. After Auchinleck and Ludlow escort Heraal out of the room, a small Stortulian enters Corrigan's office and tells him he doesn't want to work for him necessarily, but he is seeking passage to Earth so he can be reunited with his wife, who is currently under Corrigan's employ at the Institute.  When Corrigan refuses, the Stortulian leaves, and Corrigan process several dozen more applicants. When Gorb reenters and offers to replace Stebbins due to his incompetent handling of the non-terrestrials waiting in line, Corrigan threatens to have him thrown out. At that moment, Heraal returns, brandishing a large sword, which he uses to kill himself in front of everyone. As Corrigan processes this turn of events, the Ghrynian police enter and charge Corrigan with Heraal's death which includes a $100,000 Galactic fine. Next, the Stortulian reenters and attempts to shoot Corrigan, who is saved by Gorb. Gorb offers to solve Corrigan's legal liability for the death of Heraal in exchange for $5,000 Galactic and a contract with the Corrigan Institute. Corrigan agrees to the arrangement, so long as Gorb upholds his end of the bargain first.",
            "J. F. Corrigan of Earth\u2019s Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is on the planet MacTavish IV (aka Ghryne by its natives) to recruit alien life forms as specimens for display in what is effectively a zoo. This is the only way aliens can visit Earth because in 2903 the World Congress declared Earth off-limits for non-terrestrials. Throughout the day, Corrigan interviews many colorful, interesting alien life forms, ultimately hiring about two dozen. His goal is to have a collection of at least one member of 500 different races and currently has 298. He rejects some applicants simply because he already has specimens of their type. One applicant, Gorb, looks and sounds like a human but claims to be from a plant named Wazzenazz XIII. Corrigan is convinced he is just a human and sends him on his way, but Gorb says he will be back to give Corrigan another chance. \nLater in the day, Corrigan has two troublesome interviews, the first with a distraught Kallerian named Vallo Heraal who wants to be hired because four other Kallerians have been hired from a different clan than his, and he feels his clan has been insulted. Corrigan apologizes for having unintentionally insulted Heraal\u2019s clan but explains that he doesn\u2019t need any more Kallerians now; he offers to give preference to Heraal\u2019s clan when there is a vacancy. Unappeased, Heraal warns Corrigan that he will be sorry, and Corrigan sends for members of his team to escort him out. Next, a squirrely-looking Stortulian slips in, exclaiming that he must speak with Corrigan. The Stortulian explains that he is there because his wife is on Earth in Corrigan\u2019s display. She left him because she wanted to go to Earth, and now he is lonely but forbidden by his customs to remarry. He doesn\u2019t want to be hired but just wants passage to Earth to persuade his wife to return home. Corrigan patiently tells the Stortulian he can\u2019t take him because it would be illegal. The Stortullian accepts defeat, saying he has no hope at all, and Corrigan has the distinct impression that the fellow is going to commit suicide. \nAt the end of the day, Gorb returns, asking Corrigan to hire him to work with his company. Heraal crashes in and tells Corrigan he has contacted the authorities and accused him of causing the death of a life-form before he kills himself. The police arrive to arrest Corrigan, but the Stortulian returns, again claiming his life isn\u2019t worth living and fires a shot at Corrigan who is saved by the swift action of Gorb who pushes him out of the way.\n"

This is also a no, since Mr. Corrigan would be breaking the law to do so if he was an alien.\nGorb throws himself at Mr. Corrigan to tackle him and save his life from a murder attempt by the Stortulian. This gesture buys him enough goodwill for Corrigan to accept his offer to get him out of the trouble with the Ghrynian cops. He will do the job for $5000 and a contract to the Corrigan Institute - ultimately getting him what he wanted in the first place.\n",

Mr. Corrigan immediately believes he is simply an Earthman who ran out of money and is trying to find passage home. However, Gorb continues on, claiming Wazzenazz XIII is home to a race of people similar to that of Earth, and that he doesn\u2019t speak English, he\u2019s in fact telepathic. He asks to be a specimen in Corrigan\u2019s zoo, but he refuses and sends him away. \nLater in the story, Gorb arrives again, having sneaked back his guard, and asks to join his staff if he can\u2019t be a specimen. Corrigan admits Stebbins is lack-luster, but still turns him down. After the Kallerian kills himself and Mr. Corrigan is charged guilty, Gorb bides his time and waits for his moment to step in. When the Stortulian arrives and attempts to murder Mr. Corrigan, Gorb saves his life by pushing him out of the way of the blast. Gorb explains the difference between Kallerian and Stortulian cultures to a wide-eyed Mr. Corrigan and once again offers his services. He claims he can get Mr. Corrigan out of the legal mess for only a $5,000 fee and a contract to be a specimen in his zoo. Mr. Corrigan hesitantly agrees. \n",

First, he poses as an alien species from a planet called Wazzenazz XIII in the Crab Nebula. Gord is tall and slender with blue eyes and dirty blond hair. He is neat and clean, but his appearance is somewhat shabby, suggesting he might be down on his luck. He claims his name is Ildwar Gorb and that he represents the only humanlike race in the galaxy beyond Earth. He tries to con Corrigan, explaining his humanlike appearance as an evolutionary fluke and his English as telepathic symbols that Corrigan translates into English.

Gorb leaves Corrigan\u2019s office saying he\u2019ll give Corrigan another chance.\n\tThat afternoon, Gorb returns to Corrigan\u2019s office, this time setting aside his alien story and presenting himself as a human applying for a place on Corrigan\u2019s staff. He points out that he is familiar with alien life-forms, having lived in the outworlds for half of his life. Gorb says that he would have been able to stop the aliens who unexpectedly entered Corrigan\u2019s office and suggests Corrigan fire Stebbins and hire him in his place. \n\tGorb is present when Heraal returns and commits suicide in Corrigan\u2019s office, and when the police arrive telling Corrigan that they are arresting him for contributing to the untimely death of an intelligent life-form, he hears the police pronounce Corrigan\u2019s penalty of either two years in prison or a fine of $100,000 Galactic. When the Stortulian arrives and tries to shoot Corrigan, Gorb anticipates his action and tackles Corrigan, knocking him to the floor, so that the Stortulian\u2019s shot misses. Afterward, Gorb demonstrates his knowledge of alien life when he explains that Stortulians despise suicide, and when a Stortulian believes someone has caused him trouble, he kills the person who caused the trouble. Gorb also tells Corrigan that he can help him get out of his situation for only $5,000 Galactic and a specimen contract. Corrigan decides that Gorb might be able to help him better than the Terran Consulate, so he accepts Gorb\u2019s offer contingent on Gorb\u2019s success of getting him out of his arrest and fine.\n"

Mr. Corrigan is always looking for the easy way out, but he\u2019s still aware of the dangers he faces.

            "Mr. J.F. Corrigan is the proprietor of Corrigan's Institute of Morphological Science, a Terran zoo exhibiting non-terrestrial beings from around the universe. Starting out as an impoverished carnival man working in the Betelgeuse system, Corrigan had taken advantage of the isolationism of the late 29th century to establish his zoo and become a successful businessman. Corrigan claims to not want to exploit the non-terrestrials he employs as displays in his zoo, but he also doesn't want to pay them top dollar for their services. He prides himself on not hunting non-terrestrial and instead prefers to attract them by offering good pay, short hours, expenses, and transportation costs; in addition, he calls himself a \"man of principles\" and advertises about the thrill of show business and romance of life on Earth. Because Corrigan is willing to con the public--he calls himself \"a straightforward double-dealer\"--he believes he understands a con when he sees one, which is why he initially rejects Gorb's interview for a job. Corrigan is used to dealing with species from all over the galaxy, and he is prepared for trouble, so he has a meshgun trigger concealed below his desk and never allows himself to be bullied. In case he needs back up, he also employs Stebbins, who manages the line of non-terrestrials for Corrigan to interview, as well as Auchinleck and Ludlow. One of Corrigan's driving principles in dealing with non-terrestrials is to never make a business decision based upon sentiment as demonstrated by his dealings with the Stortulian. However, this interaction shows that he does feel empathy for those affected by his decisions.",
            "J.F. Corrigan is a businessman and owner of the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science. An astute businessman who also manipulates and uses others, he has built a lucrative \u201cinstitute\u201d that is really just a zoo that exhibits odd-looking aliens. Before his current position, Corrigan was a lowly carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. After the World Congress ruled Terra off-limits for aliens in 2903, Corrigan concocted his business plan. His goal is to display representatives of 500 extraterrestrial species. Corrigan can \u201cread\u201d his interviewees and take advantage of them for his own benefit. For example, when he realizes how eager Mr. Fitzgerald is to see Earth, he hires him for half of what he usually pays, knowing that Fitzgerald\u2019s eagerness will prevent him from realizing the offer takes advantage of him. \n\tThroughout the day of interviews, Corrigan assesses the applicants in terms of their value to him. While he doesn\u2019t mind taking advantage of them, he doesn\u2019t go so far as to cheat them. He is a bit of a con-man himself, hiring Mr. Fitz for half his going rate and placating Heraal with a less-than-heartfelt apology and promise to give members of his clan preference the next time they need to hire a Kallerian. Yet he won\u2019t do anything that blatantly breaks the law such as transporting a Stortulian to Earth when the alien isn\u2019t one of his hirees. He has a limited conscience; when he fears that the Stortulian will commit suicide, he feels bad about it, but he also doesn\u2019t do anything to prevent it. His pragmatism and business acumen override his emotions, preventing him from caving to the creature\u2019s requests, even if it means the creature will commit suicide. Corrigan is also sharp enough to spot a con; he recognizes Gorb for what he is: an Earthman using any means possible to obtain a paid trip to Earth. When Gorb comes across as glib and appealing despite his preposterous story, Corrigan recognizes the man\u2019s similarity to himself. Corrigan acknowledges that he is a double-dealer yets describes himself as a man of principles. Because he is a con man, he is cynical of others. Corrigan is also a manipulator who says what others want to hear (such as calling the planet Ghryne by its native name) because he knows this is a way to win their trust.\n\tCorrigan likes to think of himself as a man who has principles, but some of those principles are the ones that ensure good business decisions rather than the values regarding what is right or wrong. He also thinks of himself as a man with a conscience who doesn\u2019t exploit beings, but that is exactly what he does. He believes that because he pays his employees and they are volunteering to be placed on exhibit, he isn\u2019t exploiting them.\n\n"

His office has a desk, chairs for his interviewees to sit in, and a sign advertising that extraterrestrials are wanted. There is a waiting room outside the office, and applicants are buzzed in by Corrigan\u2019s assistant.\n\nOn this planet, there is a strong desire for aliens to want to go on exhibit on Earth. Mr. Corrigan profits from having them on display, and is willing to go through long and stressful interview days to hand select his specimens. His desire is to have at least 500 different alien races in his collection.\n\nThere is frequent reference to the location of the Corrigan Institute on Earth, though it is never visited in the story. The Institute is very popular with humans, and has 690 specimens, representing 298 different types of aliens.\n",
            "Birds of a Feather by Robert Silverberg takes place on what is commonly called Ghryne, or it\u2019s more formal name MacTavish IV. This planet is in the Caledonia cluster and currently the home of Mr. Corrigan\u2019s interviews. The Caledonia cluster is one of the many crossroads of interstellar travel, so it features many specimens from a variety of planets. The story mostly takes place in Mr. Corrigan\u2019s office, featuring a desk and a few chairs for his specimens to sit in. He hides weapons beneath his desk in case of a scary situation, as well as a distress button. ",
            "The story takes place in the 30th century primarily on Ghryne, whose official Terran name is MacTavish IV, a planet in the Caledonia Cluster, which includes other planets such as Aldebaran IX, Regulus II, Donovan's Planet, Stortul XII, and more. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet, and Mr. Corrigan holds his interviews here for his Corrigan Institute from Thirdday to Fifthday of Tenthmonth. Having been declared off-limits for non-terrestrial beings by the World Congress in 2903, Earth is now an exclusive place to be, which heightens the appeal and romance of working and visiting there. The Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science is a Terran zoo that exhibits non-terrestrial beings from all over the universe. With 690 specimens representing 298 different intelligent life-forms, the ultimate goal of the zoo is to present at least one member of at least 500 different races. Corrigan has a desk equipped with a meshgun trigger that keeps him safe in the event a non-terrestrial becomes hostile towards him.",

Days and months are named by their sequence in the week or year, hence, Thirdday, Fifthday, and Tenmonth. In 2903, the World Congress ruled that aliens were forbidden on Earth unless they were there as a specimen of a scientific collection. This exception is what allows Corrigan to conduct his lucrative business. Most of the story is set In the rented Corrigan office on the planet MacTavis (IV), or Ghryne according to its residents. All of the action takes place on this planet, although there are a few references to Earth. MacTavis (IV) is an ideal planet for Corrgan\u2019s interviews since this planet is at the interstellar crossroads, making it easily accessible for aliens from across the Caledonia Cluster to respond to Corrigan\u2019s ad for alien species to be transported to Earth for display. The planet has the features of a civilization, including city districts organized into blocks, office buildings, and hotels. There is a police department that quickly responds to emergencies and has set penalties for infractions against the law. Ghryne uses the Galactic monetary system. Corrigan\u2019s office has a modern executive set-up where he works in an inner office while his assistants manage his appointments. He has a button he can push to alert his team that they need to escort someone away from his office. Corrigan also has a meshgun mounted under his desk that he can fire in the event of an emergency.  \n"

He also sees a photo of a red-bearded man, and it turns out the woman is his wife and they need an astrogator. She tells about her husband, his team and goal. Ben understands he won't be let go if he denies the job. ",
            "The story begins with Ben Curtis entering Blast Inn. A boy catches him and brings him to a table that is close in the shadows after passing through a narrow aisle and a white-uniformed officer. Sitting at the table, Ben tells himself that he needs to find the man with red beard. He wants to escape from the images of a dead man. Later we learn that Ben murdered this man. Ben was celebrating in a bar when Cobb, a man in the bar insulted him. While Ben tries to reason with him, he expressed his dissatisfaction about spacemen. Ben has always wanted to be spacemen. He moved down three stools but the drunk man won\u2019t stop. Thus he tried to leave. But he continued and called him a sucker. Getting furious, Ben hits the man. The man\u2019s head hits the edge of the bar and he dies. Ben ran away, trying to find the group of renegade spacemen made up of misfits and rejectees.

As he is about to go unconscious, a female holds onto his hand. After he regains conscious, he realizes that the girl who grabbed him has been taking care of him for the past nine days that he was unconscious. At first, she refuses to answer his questions, but she knows everything about him. Later he learns that she is the red bearded man\u2019s wife. She saves him because he is an astrogator and a good man. ",
            "Spaceman Ben Curtis walks into the Blast Inn, a dive bar in the Venusian Hoover City. He is approached by a young Martian boy, who brings him to a table where a Martian orchestra plays aside them. In the bar, Ben is anxious and paranoid, particularly upon noticing a few Hoover City police officers. While he sits, Ben is unable to shake the image of a dead man next to him, who is a man named Cobb. Prior to Ben's arrival to Venus, he had stepped into a bar in Luna City, where an intoxicated Cobb was rambling about spacemen and how he despises them. Out of rage and personal offense, Ben punched Cobb in the chin, who died on impact after falling. Ben immediately fled to Venus in search of a red-bearded giant, the leader of a renegade space crew, who was his only hope in survival and job security after the murder. Still seated at the table, the Martian boy continues prodding Ben, who gives him a coin to shoo him off. He soon notices the space policemen from before closing in on him, raising weapons, and he attempts to escape the bar but is shot. Becoming unconscious, Ben hears the voice of a woman, who leads him out of the exit and helps him escape. He then awakes, unable to see clearly, but being cared for and fed. After nine days, he is able to see the woman clearly, who introduces herself as Maggie, and she tells him that they are no longer in Hoover City. She then discloses all the information she has on Ben, including his desire to find the red-bearded man. Ben asks her if Cobb had a wife and kids, which she confirms. As Ben scans the room, he notices a photo of the red-bearded man, and he slips into sleep, where he is again haunted by visions of Cobb. Ben asks Maggie how she knows the man, and she reveals that he is her husband, and that they saved Ben because they were in need of an astrogator. Maggie tells him about the renegade crew, and how they plan on relocating to an asteroid to avoid the authorities. Ben is overwhelmed and fearful of the prospect, but Maggie encourages him to get rest, and he reflects on his future and his duty.",
            "The story begins with Ben Curtis, an officer of the Space Corps and astrogator, leaving the Blast Inn on Venus. When he gets to the Venusian gin mill, a Martian kid tries to sell him various things to pique his interest. Ben indicates that he is not interested in any of the offers and the kid eventually leads him to a table that is partially hidden. The location of his table is intentional because he does not want to be seen. Ben becomes deep in thought at the table, intent on finding a man described as having a red beard. \n\nWhile at the table, he also thinks about the events that transpired over the last week when he arrived in Luna City from White Sands. Ben had gone to a bar to celebrate his arrival to Luna City when Cobb drunkenly accosted him. Cobb purposefully tried to anger Ben and eventually was successful in doing so after a particularly poignant threat. In a quick and anger-filled response, Ben struck Cobb causing Cobb to crack his head against the edge of the bar and die. Ben flew to Venus in response to the incident, which explains how he currently arrived in a Venusian bar. \n\nHis thoughts are interrupted when he notices policemen entering the bar. The police quickly find Ben and begin to use deadly neuro-pistols. He begins to run and is eventually hit by one of the blasts from the neuro-pistols. As he realizes he is losing consciousness, an unknown pair of hands guided him towards a different exit. Ben passes out from the blast and wakes up in a room. For 9+ days, he goes in and out of sleep in this room while he recovers from his injuries. Maggie, the woman who helped him escape, is the one helping him recover from his injuries. She knows a lot of information about him and his background. \n\nWhile still recovering, Ben notices that on one side of the bed, there is a picture on a bureau in the far corner of the room that shows a portrait of a red-bearded man. He gets really excited at this new revelation. He asks Maggie about the red-bearded man and she confesses that he is her husband and then explains what he does and why she brought Ben with her. Jacob\u2019s group needs an astrogator and want Ben to join them. While Maggie shows that she would be confused if Ben chose not to join the group, she seems to truly be concerned with his recovery. \n\nWhen Maggie leaves the room, Ben reflects on words found in a book from his childhood that talk about the morals of a Space Officer. He acknowledges how very few are able to get the job in the SpaceCorps. The story ends with implications that Ben will choose his moral values and choose not to join Jacob\u2019s group. \n"

This makes Jeffers angry, knowing that he cannot fire Tolliver, he decides to make Tolliver\u2019s job extremely boring. Thus, for the next few days, he simply hang around the garage, with nothing to do. Then on Friday, he gets assigned to take the creeper outside.

Tolliver is very unhappy with Jeffers and is roughly expressing his frustration to him. Their conversation does not end well and Jeffers is clear that he will retaliate against Tolliver\u2019s demands. Tolliver leaves the room grunting about how Jeffers and his men can steal the Great Red Spot off of Jupiter at their own risk. \n\nOver the next few days, Tolliver grows frustrated that he is not being assigned anything. One day, he does get an assignment. He is meant to pick up a home office relative coming in from the Javelin. Tolliver picks up a woman named Betty and transports her. Very early on he appears not to like her and decides to scare her and make it seem that there is danger at every corner. They arrive at their destination and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers office. Tolliver barges into Jeffers office, with Betty in tow, to purposefully upset Jeffers. Jeffers is angered at Tolliver\u2019s arrival, but excitedly greets Betty. However, his warm greeting is not returned by Betty. Betty quickly accuses him of wrongdoings and wants him to leave his position. At first he is too stunned to speak. He quickly recovers and orders some men to lock both Tolliver and Betty in a room. Tolliver tries to fight against one of the guards meant to imprison him. His success does not last long and he finds himself in an empty office next to the warehouse building. Tolliver quickly begins to plot their escape. Betty decides to join him in escaping the room. \n\nThey are able to leave the room and go through the warehouse where they find spacesuits to wear. Making their way outside of the warehouse, Tolliver uses the knife that came with the spacesuit to slash a section out of the dome. They step through the section and walk normally to not attract attention to themselves. Tolliver suggests they go find her ship to make a call to the emergency number that Betty was given. In their process, they escape the dome and into the almost vacuum air of Ganymede\u2019s surface and run to Betty\u2019s ship. As they get closer to Betty\u2019s ship, Tolliver notices a tractor headed towards them. They hurry onto the ship. Tolliver quickly readies the ship for takeoff to Betty\u2019s surprise. Betty grabs a memo from her pocket inside the spacesuit to give Tolliver the number to call. Once the call is connected, Betty requests assistance to arrest Jeffers and co-conspirators. Tolliver becomes suspicious during her call with Space Patrol and she eventually tells him that she is not actually Koslow\u2019s daughter. Eventually, the ship takes off. \n\nTolliver tells Betty that he is taking them back to Earth but the journey will take 6 months. However, thinking to himself, Tolliver wonders when Betty will catch on that they will just be orbiting Ganymede and not the path she thinks. \n",
            "Johnny Tolliver is a space pilot from Earth to Jupiter and all the way round who works to get enough money for an engineering degree. His superior, Jeffers, tries to get him involved in the sneaky deals of stealing some cargo meant to be transported to Earth. Tolliver refuses as he wants to return clean and as fast as possible to Earth. Jeffers can't fire him and Tolliver feels safe. For the next few days Johnny has nothing to do as he is made to drive a tractor and doesn't have any assignments. Then he gets word he will be assigned to drive a tractor with some home-office relative, who has a lot of bags as a cargo, which is a simple waste of fuel. The relative is a young girl named Betty who tries to behave like a spacer, like all those relatives do, though they only spend a couple months in space doing nothing. Betty wants to learn traffic routing and she doesn't see Johnny's drive from the city to the spaceport on Ganymede as a mission. That scorn makes the man mad and he tells that the trips are dangerous and many men had died on those drives. Tolliver makes up those lies to scare the girl and diminish her arrogance and scorn, and to impress her in some way, he also shows his significant payment. Then, Tolliver leads subdued Betty to Jeffers, who treats her with utmost respect and sweetness remembering who her father is. The girl though takes a threatening tone claiming she will be in charge of her father's company one day and that she has learned what's going wrong on Ganymede, so Jeffers is as good as fired. Jeffers then calls three men in to lock Betty and Tolliver up. Jeffers believes Tolliver has told everything to Betty and she learns from Johnny that he was asked to join the smuggling gang. Tolliver manages to heat and open the door, Betty follows and they approach a storeroom for spacesuits. The two put them on and pretend to be inspecting domes, they get into a low gravity field to reach the ship she arrived in. Tolliver confesses in exaggerating the dangers on the way, then they get into the ship and to the control room, and Johnny plans to take off while Betty was simply going to use her connection on radio or TV. Tolliver and Betty take off and the phone number she has turns out to be Space Patrol. Johnny realizes throughout the dialogue that the person on the other end was waiting for the girl's report to know who to arrest. Betty turns out to be Koslow's daughter but a private investigator. The ship Tolliver and Betty are on is orbiting Ganymede, but the former convinces the girl they are on a long way to Earth. ",
            "Johnny Tolliver is a space pilot, working for the Ganymedan branch at Koslow Spaceways. He sits in the office of his supervisor, Jeffers, who has invited him to take part in a scheme where he steals parts of ships' cargoes in order to make profit. Tolliver is skeptical and uncomfortable with this operation, and he refuses. Though Jeffers cannot fire him, because he is on contract, he takes Tolliver off his assigned orbit. The next day, Tolliver finds that instead of being assigned a ship, he has the mundane job of driving a tractor from domes to the spaceport. The job drags on for the next three days when Tolliver is informed that he has the job of escorting a home-office relative to the city. The relative is a young girl named Betty, whom Tolliver immediately perceives as naive and arrogant. To entertain himself on the drive, Tolliver makes up stories about the dangers of Ganymede and his job as a daredevil tractor driver, showing Betty his paycheck. They arrive into the city, and Tolliver leads Betty to Jeffers' office at her request. Jeffers greets Betty, addressing her as Miss Koslow, indicating that she is the daughter of the boss of Koslow Spaceways, to which Tolliver is surprised and secretly regrets the embellished stories he told her. Betty immediately orders Jeffers to be fired out of suspicions of mismanagement. Jeffers, sure that Betty had found out about his side scheme, locks up Tolliver and Betty in an empty office room. Tolliver manages to escape by using fire to bend the plastic door, and Betty insists on joining him. The two find spare spacesuits and get into disguise while they make their way to a spaceship. Tolliver cuts a slit into the dome over the establishment and they squeeze through, running to the spaceport. As they reach the ship, Tolliver notices a tractor headed their way, and he rushes Betty inside. Tolliver quickly launches the ship into orbit despite Betty's protests. Betty then phones Space Patrol, given access by her father, and informs the officer to arrest Jeffers and that the ship they are on has been sent on a six-month orbit. When Betty signs off, it is revealed to Tolliver that she is not actually Koslow's daughter, but a private investigator impersonating her in order to get information on who was stealing from the company. Tolliver informs Betty that they will be on the ship for a while, not telling her that they would be orbiting Ganymede the entire time."

It also added that he was a DCT First Class owner. Hendricks lectures Joe about his new designation, but Joe does not care to hear him. The commissioner tries to convince Joe to leave New York or to use the free psychology service. \n\nHendricks explains that he cannot think of a way to help Joe without committing a crime himself. In an unexpected move, Hendricks offers Joe a seemingly available victim and their address. Joe memorizes the available information and goes to the address to commit a crime. Joe enters the apartment and takes a watch. He then shouts outside a window that there is a thief. Joe proceeds to run down to the street and is caught by a police helicopter and handcuffed. \n\nJoe eventually wakes up after months of treatment in a hospital and is picked up by Hendricks. He goes through the large crowd waiting to meet him upon exiting the hospital and has an uneasy feeling about the interactions. He is confused by the reaction of the crowd. Hendrick says that it was a fake apartment that Joe went to and is one that the police use for special cases like his when a person refuses to find a solution. Joe becomes upset because he realizes that he has become a prisoner in his own body because of the treatment from the CPA and he has great contempt for the results. \n",
            "A girl goes up to Joe Harper's table in a tavern and says that Hank said that Joe wanted to see her. He gives her fifty dollars and tells her that he wants her to do a quick job for him. Joe has been trying to get drunk all afternoon because he will get free room and board for a month from the AAA. The girl wonders why he doesn't just get a job but hands her his CPA ID card. She sees that he has Dangerous Criminal Tendencies, which she then realizes why. The CPA does not punish criminals and focuses more on preventing crime. Therefore, criminals who get convicted are sent to hospitals where all criminal tendencies are removed from the mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, and many other devices. However, these criminals are also hailed as heroes once they have left the treatment program. The girl agrees to his plan, and they go to the alley. He rips her clothes off and tells her to accuse him of rape. However, she cannot agree to the plan because she is a sergeant of the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA). He doesn't want to hear it but, she sends him flying through the air. Commissioner Hendricks speaks to him when he wakes up at the police commissioner's office, and Joe confesses to conspiracy. The crime has been prevented, but his new ID card now has DCT written in even larger red font. This signifies him as a DCT First Class, which means that many other amateur cops will begin to watch him in hopes that he will commit a crime. He further taunts Joe and says that all sorts of people on the street will ask about him and that his life is over because he is a freak. When Joe says that he is broke, Hendricks offers to loan him some money. Although both want to see Joe convicted, Hendricks cannot directly help him because it is either a Violation of Civil Rights or will cause him to commit a crime. However, as soon as Hendricks leaves to get water, Jon flips through Hendricks' book and finds somebody to rob. He goes to John Gralewski's apartment to steal a watch and is arrested promptly by the police. The story then goes to Hendricks telling Jon to wake up and that his treatment is now over. Jon says that he does not feel like a hero, while Hendricks tells him that they only admire him because he will never commit another crime again. When they get inside the car, Hendricks tells Jon that he will have the job he has always wanted now, but the treatment has written a set of laws in his mind that prevents him from committing crimes. Joe now realizes how lousy this system is and wants out of it, but it is too late. He demands to get out of the car and realizes he has become a prisoner with himself. ",
            "A relatively beautiful girl sits down at Joe's table in the bar and gets paid for some future job. Joe tells her he is trying to get drunk, but the robot-bartender keeps watering his drink as being drunk is illegal. The plan is to join AAA and to live there for free for a month, but there are clever robots in every bar in New York. The girl suggests finding a job and learns that Joe had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT), which is visible in his ID card. Joe wants the girl to help him commit a crime which is almost impossible as CPA prevents every crime by various means. Those few who succeed are not punished but given treatment in hospitals after which they become perfect employees wanted by every company. Joe and the girl go out into the alley and the man asks her to scream to make everything look like an attempted rape. Nevertheless, the girl refuses as she was taught self-defense and is a sergeant, a rank she doesn't want to lose. When Joe tries anyway, the girl beats him down and police comes soon. They had a hidden microphone nearby and don't believe in the attempted rape story. Conspiracy is not considered a crime and Joe's ID has a larger DCT inscription now - a first class one. This means more cops will watch him as a hobby, as well as neighbors and other people. Hendricks, the police officer, suggests Joe gets the free treatment and then shows a small book with the contacts of nor properly protected people, listed in order to fix that blind spots. After leaving the book on the table, the officer goest to the nest room to get some water, and leaves Joe with the opportunity. Soon, Joe visits one of the listed apartments, an old building with an unreported new room. Joe steals a watch from there and screams for help, then runs and gets caught. After a while, Joe wakes up from a nightmare and sees Hendricks, who announces the end of treatment. The treatment lasted for months and made Joe feel more relaxed but nothing more. A huge crowd is waiting outside to cheer the ex-criminal for his newly gained honesty and inability to commit crime. A woman in the crowd blesses Joe for not committing a murder, which confuses him, as ex-murderers are even more cheered. Then Hendricks explains that he didn't do Joe a favor but such help in crimes is to prevent huger damages from those who refuse free treatment and want to be Exes, as they see those as heroes. Turns out an Ex has to work harder than other people and they still want to commit crime but the laws sound in their heads and prevent it causing pain. CPA is everywhere. ",
            "The story begins with Joe paying a girl fifty dollars, asking her to do a job for him. He does not describe what the job is, but mentions that it will only takes a few minutes. Joe tries to get drunk, but is unsuccessful because the CPA robots prevent anyone from getting too drunk. Then we learn that the CPA is a system that prevents crimes from occurring. It has been very successful. Only a few hundred of crimes has occurred in the past year. Those that did commit a crime are considered heroes, and they are not punished because they outsmarted the system. Instead, they will be put in a CPA hospital for treatments. Afterward, they will be provided with some of the most paid jobs. Joe and the girl goes into the alleyway where he attempts to rape her. She tells him that he cannot do this. But he continues because he wants to get the treatment for a nice job. But because the girl refuses to corporate, she hits him and he drops to the ground. He wakes up in the police commissioner\u2019s office where his conspiracy is revealed through a hidden speaker in the alley. His CPA card is changed to a First Class DCT. After Commissioner Hendricks explains the troubles he will have as a First Class, Hendricks reveals the address to an unprotected property. Then Joe decides to rob the place. After stealing a watch, he purposely let himself get caught. When he wakes up again, his treatment at the CPA hospital is over. As he gets ready to go home, Hendricks tells him about the truth of the treatment: he simply cannot break any rules because his brain does not let him. "

            "Councillor Magnan assigns Retief on a mission to Jorgensen's Worlds to warn and prepare them for an attack by the Soetti, an alien species characterized by their long legs, turnip-shaped torsos, snapper arms, and aggressive infiltration of Terrestrial space. Since Jorgensen's Worlds are underdeveloped technologically, Magnan wants Retief to help the Jorgies convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon for their defense. Retief has four weeks to complete his mission. Magnan has booked him a space flight as far as Aldo Cerise, and he warns Retief prior to departure to look out for the Soetti, who are patrolling the customs areas into Jorgensen's Worlds. Retief brings a gun with him in case he encounters trouble. When he arrives to check in to his flight, the clerk informs him that his flight is full, and he has no chance of boarding. Retief finds out the gate number and goes there, knocking out a guard in order to make his way onto the ship. When Retief locates his cabin, he discovers a tall man named Mr. Tony and his henchman, a short, thick-necked man named Marbles are already there. Mr. Tony orders his henchman to remove Retief, but Retief throws his luggage out into the corridor and closes the door. A few minutes later, Marbles returns with the ship's captain and orders Retief to leave the ship. Again, Retief refuses, and the captain's henchmen avoid escalation having seen Retief's previous aggression with Mr. Tony's luggage. At dinner later, the waiters refuse to serve Retief, and he sees the Captain dining with Mr. Tony and his henchmen. Retief meets the ship's chef Chip, who serves him food. Meanwhile, four of Mr. Tony's henchmen come to Retief's table to find out why he wants to go to Jorgensen's Worlds. When Marbles pulls a knife, Chef Chip offers Retief a knife of his own, but he simply punches Marbles in the face, knocking him out. Another thug pulls a gun on Retief, but the Captain defuses the situation, thinking about his career. After everyone leaves, Chip informs Retief that the Captain has a shady business arrangement with Mr. Tony wherein he ferries unknown cargo instead of tourists to Jorgensen's World with frequent visits from the Soetti. Before the conversation has ended, the Captain arrives with a Soetti named Skaw, who wants to question Retief. When Retief refuses to show Skaw his papers, Skaw moves in for the attack, and Retief breaks his slender leg. Skaw flops about the floor until he dies. Horrified, the Captain worries the other Soetti will react violently, but Retief orders him to show them the body of Skaw and some guns, predicting they will retreat. Later, Chip informs Retief that Mr. Tony is deeply upset about Skaw's death, considering they were close business partners; he also tells him the captain has ordered a course-change to bypass Jorgensen's Worlds and head straight to Alabaster. Retief finds the captain and strong-arms him into maintaining his course to Jorgensen's Worlds.",
            "Magnan, a Councillor of the Corps, assigns an officer of high rank, Retief, on a dangerous courier mission to stop the forceful takeover of the Terrestrial occupied space of Jorgensen's Worlds (a cluster of four planets around a star) by the Soetti. Magan suggests a show of force against the Soetti is necessary, and details that he has acquired their war plan and weapon schematics. The Soetti will attack the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds in less than four weeks and are already patrolling the trade lanes into them, making Retief\u2019s entry sketchy even while hiding his Corps credentials. Magnan gives him a ticket departing in four hours to the Aldo Cerise to start Retief\u2019s trip. However, Retief has to punch out an attendant to actually get on this ship because his ticket has been voided by \u201cVIPs\u201d booking the train up to capacity and bumping him off. Retief goes to his originally assigned cabin, but it is already full of expensive luggage. Two men tell him it\u2019s Mr.Tony\u2019s room and that he needs to leave. The Captain shows up and tries to tell Retief to leave as well, but Retief cites the Uniform Code law that protects confirmed space on interplanetary vessels. \nRetief meets the chef, Chip, in the dining car as he watches the red-haired Captain eat with a table of men, including Mr. Tony. One of the \u201cthugs\u201d dining with the Captain dips a cigar into Retief\u2019s coffee while walking past, and Retief throws the coffee on him and punches him in the chin. Mr. Tony calls on one of his men, Marbles, to take out Retief and he attacks. Chip offers Retief a knife, but he doesn\u2019t take it. The Captain urges them to stop fighting saying he has his \u201ccharter to consider\u201d.\nChip brings Retief a meal in his cabin, and tells him that the Captain and Mr. Tony are in a crooked business arrangement and haven\u2019t let any tourists into Jorgensen's World in 6-8 months. They only make quick stops and never pick up any cargo. The passengers currently aboard are headed to Alabaster. The Soetti board the vessel, and one of them, Skaw, appears at Retief\u2019s cabin with the Captain and demands his papers. Skaw threatens Retief with snapping claws, but Retief refuses and breaks his leg, which leaks green fluid and kills Skaw. \nThe Soetti don\u2019t retaliate when Skaw\u2019s body is returned to them, but the thugs and Mr. Tony are very angry with the Captain, and force him to pass by Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and go straight to Alabaster. Retief goes to the Captain\u2019s quarters and tries to get him to return to the original course. The Captain initially refuses, but Retief slams his fingers in a drawer and the Captain obliges. It will be 18 hours to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and Retief asks Chip to bring him pots of coffee to keep him awake as he stays with the Captain to ensure he stays on course under threat of shooting him with his 2mm needler weapon.\n",
            "The story opens with Magnan debriefing Retief about the Soetti, who are planning to seize Jorgensen's Worlds. Retief is to be tasked with getting to Jorgensen's Worlds before the arrival of the Soetti to equip the people of Jorgensen's Worlds with advanced weaponry and a battle plan to defend themselves. Retief boards a ship on Aldo Cerise without a boarding pass and claims a room that is meant for a man named Mr. Tony. Mr. Tony calls his associates and they attempt to remove Retief from his room but are unsuccessful. As they travel towards Jorgensen's Worlds, it becomes clear that the ship is under the control of Mr. Tony, who has some sort of shady dealings with the Soetti. Retief learns this with the aid of the ship's cook, Chip. A Soetti named Skaw appears and attempts to find out more about Retief and his purpose for being on the ship, but Retief kills Skaw. The captain then attempts to change the course of the ship, but Retief forces him to stay the course towards Jorgensen's Worlds."

            "The Soettis are involved in some kind of illegal activity with the Captain and Mr. Tony. The Soettis, nicknamed Sweaties, by humans who dislike them, are an alien species who have been moving deep into the sector where the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds are located. The Soettis are unattractive creatures with skinny legs like a lobster\u2019s and a big chest shaped somewhat like a turnip. They have rubbery heads, and you can see their pulse beating when they get upset. They have tiny arms with toothed pincers at the ends and threaten humans with them. These pincers are incredibly strong and can cut through steel. \nIt has been learned that they are planning to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds by force, a move of open aggression against Terrestrial territory that cannot be overlooked. The headquarters where Retief works has obtained the Soetti War Plan from a defector of Terrestrials who have actually been providing advice to the Soettis, so the plan is for Retief to travel personally to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds to provide them with this information and also with the schematics that will enable them to convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon to protect the planets. Reaching the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soettis are on patrol in the trade lanes where the airships travel to the Worlds. The Soettis look down on Terrestrials and try to assert themselves over them. The Soettis can speak English, so they can communicate with the Terrestrials.\nThe Captain is afraid of the Soettis and worries that when Retief harms Skaw, the Soetties will kill all of the humans. Retief intends for Skaw to go back and tell the other Soettis that they can no longer enter the Terrestrials\u2019 airships and search them. When Skaw dies, the Captain is certain they are done for, but Retief tells him to bluff and show guns when they return the body, and the Soettis will back down. Surprisingly, the Soettis don\u2019t say anything about Skaw\u2019s death, but Mr. Tony is furious. Retief thinks it is good to know that the Soettis are easy to kill.\n",
            "The Soetti are a hostile alien species that have been infiltrating Terrestrial space. Councillor Magnan and his associates have uncovered their plot to seize Jorgensen's Worlds and assign Retief to travel to the underdeveloped planets to help prepare a defense.  The Soetti are tall creatures with skinny legs, big chests, and round, bulbous torsos. Their heads look rubbery and pulse when they are angry. Soettis have two small arms with pincers for hands that are sharp enough to cut through steel. Magnan warns Retief to be on the lookout for Soettis when he boards his flight for Jorgensen's Worlds, since they tend to patrol the customs areas. They also seem to have some kind of business arrangement with the Captain of the ship that ferries to Jorgensen's World and Mr. Tony, a space thug who employs a number of strong men like Marbles to rough up passengers to Jorgensen's Worlds who might get too curious. Chip informs Retief that the Soetti frequently board the ship, although he is not clear as to their purpose. A Soetti named Skaw confronts Retief and asks to see his papers. When Retief refuses the request, Skaw moves in to attack him. Retief discovers a Soetti weakness when he breaks Skaw's slender leg, spilling greenish blood, and ultimately killing Skaw. Retief demonstrates to the Captain how this can be used as leverage against the hostile aliens.",
            "Soettis are an alien race of lobster-like crustaceans with skinny legs, big chests and rubbery heads that show their beating pulse. They patrol the trade lanes into the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds and one of them, Skaw, boards the merchant vessel that Retief is riding on, acting as if he is a Customs Patrol officer. Skaw is tall with tiny hoof-like feet, and a loose mantle that flaps around knobby knees. He wears a metal helmet. Retief easily breaks the joint of one of Skaw\u2019s legs which then leaks green fluid and kills Skaw.\nThey are significant to the story because they are the enemies that Retief is being sent on a Corps mission to clear from the Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds where they are mounting a hostile takeover of Terrestrial space. After Retief discovers how easy they are to kill, he knows he can exploit this weakness to succeed on his mission to reclaim Jorgensen's Worlds for Terrestrials.\n",
            "The Soettis are an aggressive species that is attempting to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force. They are much more technologically advanced than the Jorgensen's Worlds, especially when it comes to weaponry. The Soetti look different than the other characters in the story, with skinny legs like lobsters, and big chests that look like turnips. They have hoof-like feet as well. In Retief's quest to defend Jorgensen's Worlds, he finds that they have some kind of shady dealings with Mr. Tony aboard the transport ship from Aldo Cerise."

These planets are freezing cold and are undeveloped and mostly populated with farmers and traders. They have a small amount of industry, just enough to support their merchant fleet. However, the governing body in this sector of space has received word that an alien race, the Soetti, has plans to seize Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds. The governing body isn\u2019t going to sit by and let the aliens take over Terrestrial-occupied territory. Retief is on a mission to deliver information to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds that will enable them to defend themselves from the alien attack, providing them with the Soettis War Plan, a battle plan for the planets, and the schematics that will enable them, in a matter of minutes, to convert their anti-acceleration fields into a powerful weapon. Reaching Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds will be challenging because the Soetti are patroling the trade lanes to the planet. Their successful defense against the Soetti hinges on Retief\u2019s reaching the planets in time for them to make the conversions before the aliens' attack.",

Technologically underdeveloped, Jorgensen's Worlds make their industries in farming and trading and have nothing in the way of defense against hostile attack. The Soetti plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds as part of their efforts to continue infiltrating Terrestrial space; this plan was revealed to Councillor Magnan and his associates by a defector from a group of Terrestrials who had been working with the Soetti. Councillor Magnan sends Retief on the four-day trip to help them convert their anti-acceleration field into a powerful weapon that may be used to defend themselves against the Soetti. Tourism to Jorgensen's Wolrds has recently come to a stand-still, but a ship piloted by the Captain and occupied by Mr. Tony, his henchmen, and the attendant Soetti ferries frequently to the planets carrying a mystery cargoload. The Captain wants to avoid stopping at Jorgensen's Worlds when he realizes Retief is slowly uncovering the plot, so he orders a course-change to Alabaster. But Retief stops him.",

Most of the population lives on the warmest of the planets, Svea. Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped, populated by mostly farmers or traders, with industry playing only a minor economic role that barely supports the Merchant Fleet to make runs to them. They are significant because they are within Terrestrial space and an alien race, the Soetti, are trying to claim them by hostile takeover which Retief is sent by the Corps to stop. The Jorgensen's Worlds have essentially no ability to defend themselves since they don't have an armed force, so they can only be saved by the Corps.",

Many of the inhabitants of Jorgensen's Worlds are mechanics. Jorgensen's Worlds are significant because they are the target of the Soetti, who hope to take the worlds by force.

His role as chef enables him to have contact with the Captain, crew, and passengers, which makes him extremely valuable to Retief. In addition, he likes Retief since he stands up to Mr. Tony and the Captain, neither of whom Chip can stand. When the serving staff ignore Retief, Chip serves Retief and later continues serving him meals in his room. When Retief is threatened by one of Mr. Tony\u2019s goons wielding a knife, Chip passes a knife from the kitchen to Retief to defend himself. Most importantly, Chip shares his wealth of knowledge with Retief and assists him.

Chip is friendly to Retief from their first meeting and supportive of his mission since he does not trust the Soetti and he thinks they look at men like worms. Chip takes liberties to deliver food to Retief in his room, which allows them to have private conversations about the Captain and Mr.Tony, and will support Retief with coffee during the 18 hours he has to stay awake to watch the Captain and ensure he stays on course to Jorgensen's Worlds.",

Together, they have cut off all tourism to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds for the past six to eight months; the airlines won\u2019t provide any bookings for passengers; however, the Captain\u2019s airship has at least a dozen empty rooms. Mr. Tony has several henchmen working for him who do his \u201cdirty business\u201d of roughhandling anyone who interferes with Mr. Tony\u2019s business. Whatever their business is, it involves frequent trips to Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds without taking any cargo there. Mr. Tony seems to hold power over the Captain.\n\tThe Captain is a thin, leathery-skinned man who wears white ducks, a blue turtleneck, and a peaked cap that he tilts rakishly over one eye. He isn\u2019t a very strong person or leader. He tries to get Mr. Tony\u2019s men to throw Retief off the ship, but they refuse to do so when Retief warns them not to try and when they realize he is the person who picked up Mr. Tony\u2019s trunk and threw it. The Captain has ordered Retief to get off the ship but backs down when the men refuse to touch Retief. He apparently tells the wait staff in the restaurant to refuse service to Retief because they all ignore him. And when the Captain warns Mr. Tony\u2019s henchmen not to shoot Retief on his airship because it could threaten his charter, one of them talks back and tells him he won\u2019t need it for long.

It appears that Mr. Tony is a thug whose men work as guards of whatever cargo is being transported to Jorgensen's Worlds. The Captain and Mr. Tony are also working with the Soetti, who visit the ship during each flight, according to Chip. Although the exact details of their plot are never revealed, Retief assumes it has something to do with the Soetti's overall plan to seize Jorgensen's Worlds in their overall infiltration of Terrestrial space. Although the Captain and Mr. Tony are friendly, the Captain is concerned about his charter, and he draws the line when Mr. Tony's men come for Retief with a gun. He calls off his henchman and leaves.",

For the last 6-8 months they have not delivered any tourists to Jorgensen's Worlds, and never pick up any cargo, which is highly suspicious. \nMr. Tony deals closely with the Soettis, and is very upset when the Soetti Skaw is killed and the body has to be returned to them. Skaw boards the Merchant Vessel to check Retief\u2019s papers even though he has no authority, and Retief kills him by breaking his leg joint which leaks green fluid. Mr. Tony and one of his \u201cthugs\u201d, Marbles, yell at the Captain for half an hour in his cabin after this incident and force him to change course to not stop at Jorgensen\u2019s Worlds, demonstrating that Mr. Tony has control over the Captain in their relationship.\n",

Chip says that the captain has a crooked business agreement with Mr. Tony, but it becomes clear later in the story that the business agreement is really controlled by the Soetti.

His administrative assistant, Miss Yolanda Meuhl, wants him to attend Groacian cultural events, but Retief is more interested in addressing the nine-year-old mystery of the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific--an event which was followed by a coup d'etat enacted by the current Groacian government. Much to Miss Meuhl's dismay, Retief shirks his cultural duties and makes his way to the Foreign Office Archives, whereupon he is promptly barred from entering by a pale-featured Archivist speaking in the throat-bladder vibrations of the native Groacians. Because of the Archivist's insistence that \"outworlders\" cannot access the archives, Retief begins walking back to the Consulate and stops at a bar for a drink. At the, a drunken Groacian approaches Retief and threatens to cage him and put him on display as a freak. The bartender orders the drunken Groacian out of the bar, and Retief follows him, ultimately beating him up for information. When Retief returns to the Consulate, Miss Meuhl informs him that two angry Groaci await him in his office. One is Fith, an employee of the Terrestrial Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the other is Shluh, a representative of the Internal Police. They are there to investigate reports that Retief has assaulted a Groacian national--an accusation Retief ignores in order to launch into his own accusations that the Groaci were engaged in a cover-up of the whereabouts of the ISV Terrific. Miss Meuhl continually interjects, expresses horror at Retief's claims, and apologizes to the Groacians on behalf of the Terrestrial Consulate. Despite the persistent denials of the Groacians, Retief continues his accusations, suggesting the coup d'etat was an effort to silence government officials with knowledge of the truth of what happened to the cruiser and its crew. Then he reveals what he discovered from the drunken Groacian: The crew of the ISV Terrific had been caged and paraded through the streets of Groac and then neglected until they died. Fith and Shluh finally admit the truth and offer to show Retief the hidden cruiser in order to show their contrition. When Retief sees the ship, he once again accuses the Groacians of attempting to mislead him, saying that this is a lifeboat, and he demands to see the actual ship. Fith has had enough and threatens to arrest Retief, who yields and goes back to the Consulate. There, Miss Meuhl is at her wits end. Retief orders her to barricade herself inside the office while he goes to the Foreign Ministry to gather more evidence. When he returns, Miss Meuhl informs him she has reported him to Regional Headquarters, and Retief learns he has been relieved of his post. Soon after, the Groacians appoint Miss Meuhl to his position, and Fith and Shluh enter to arrest him.",
            "Consul Whaffle left the Terrestrial Consul three months prior, leaving Retief in charge. Retief is sick of the constant cultural events and lack of real progress, so he\u2019s beginning to suspect the Groaci are hiding something. He turns down the latest invitation, offending his Administrative Assistant Miss Meuhl. She is horrified at his choices and at his questioning the Groaci\u2019s motives. Retief wants to learn more about the Terrestrial cruiser, Terrific ISV, that crashed on Groac nine years ago. Miss Meuhl disapproves and believes the Groacian side of the story, but Retief is not convinced. He is turned down at the Archies, as he is an outsider. He leaves and decides to visit a bar and try the local drink. There, Retief is refused by the bartender as well, claiming his stomach can\u2019t handle their drink. A drunk Groacian in the background whispers about putting Retief in a cage where he belongs. He follows the drunk after he gets thrown out and violently interrogates him.\nWhen Retief returns to his office, Miss Meuhl announces that there are two Groaci waiting for him. Fith and Shluh, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Internal Police respectively, have heard about the assaults on a Groacian. Retief asks Miss Meuhl to record their conversation. Retief admits to his questioning, but not before doing some of his own. He prods the two Groaci about the Terrific ISV cruiser and soon reveals that the drunk told him about the zoo-like parade of Terrestrials. Fith admits to the parade and tells them that the Terrestrials died afterward due to insufficient nutrition. The Groaci hid their blunder and lied to the Terrestrials about what truly happened. Retief asks them to take him to the cruiser, which they do. After they explore a little, Fith and Shluh ask him to keep his mouth shut. Retief refuses and says that this ship was the lifeboat, not the cruiser itself. Four armed Groaci surround Retief, but he talks his way out of the situation. \nHe returns to the Consulate and tells Miss Meuhl everything, warning her to prepare for the present crisis. She is still upset and defends the Groaci. He tells her to lock herself in the Consulate and wait for his return. If something were to happen, she is to send the recording and all his evidence to Regional Headquarters. He leaves to break into the Foreign Ministry. When he returns, he asks Miss Meuhl to fire up the sender, which she\u2019d already done. She had reported him to the Regional Headquarters and all his misactions. Counsellor Pardy pops up on the screen and attempts to relieve Retief of his duties, but he quickly shuts it off. Retief says he found the missing cruiser but is interrupted by the local communicator. A Groacian promotes Miss Meuhl to Consul, and she lets in the so-called peace squad. They surround Retief, armed, and Miss Meuhl waives Retief\u2019s diplomatic immunity. Shluh orders his men to take Retief. \n",
            "At the Terrestrial Consulate General on the planet Groac, Retief has taken over for Consul Whaffle who left three months prior. Administrative Assistant Miss Yolanda Meuhl used to serve Consul Whaffle, and is not pleased with how Retief is handling things. Retief dictates a response declining a prestigious invitation to a Groacian event to Miss Meuhl, and she warns he will offend them. This is not Retief\u2019s only controversy. He also questions the coup d'etat of the present government and the disappearance of the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, nine years ago, which are considered topics to be avoided by Miss Meuhl. Retief is denied entry into the Foreign Office Archives to investigate, and steps into a local bar. A drunkard Groacian calls Retief a freak and then is escorted out by two other customers. Retief follows the drunk out to the street and pins him down to the ground to have a \u201clong talk\u201d.\nBack in Retief\u2019s consulate office, two angry Groacian officials, Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh, of the Internal Police, accuse Retief of beating the drunkard. Retief has Miss Meuhl officially record the conversation and pivots to ask what happened to the Terrestrial cruiser, ISV Terrific, that disappeared nine years ago. Fith is offended and calls for Retief to be fired. Retief presses on to ask why the government fell after the visit of a Terrestrial investigation task force after the incident. He notices the Groacians are covering something up - not letting Terrestrials have social contacts outside the diplomatic circle and never speaking of a parade of six Terrestrials hauled through the streets after the vessel disappeared. Fith admits that six Terrans were captured and they fell ill and died because the Groacians didn\u2019t know what to feed them. Fith admits the ship descended intact East of the city, and that they didn\u2019t realize they had done something terrible until the Terran warships came. So they covered their mistake, purging their guilty leaders, concealing what happened, and offering Terrans diplomatic relations.  Fith and Shluh take Retief to see the ship in a cavern, however, it is not the real ISV Terrific. The Terrific was a twenty thousand ton ship, and this one is only a small lifeboat. Fith becomes furious. Shluh and four constables escort Retief back to the city and ban him from leaving or questioning Groacian government matters. \nRetief decides to find what happened to the real Terrific before they destroy all the Archives\u2019 paperwork. He instructs Miss Meuhl to lock herself in the consulate office. She reports Retief to Regional Headquarters. When Retief returns, he wants to send his findings to Regional Headquarters, but when they reconnect, Counsellor Pardy, DSO-1, Deputy Under-secretary for the region fires Retief. Miss Meuhl answers a call from the Groacians who accredit her as the new Terrestrial Consul to Groac (Retief\u2019s role). She lets armed Groacian\u2019s into the consulate and waives diplomatic immunity for Retief. A total betrayal that shocks Retief.",
            "Consul Retief for the Terrestrial States is serving on the Groac planet, having replaced the previous consul, Mr. Whaffle, three months ago. His Administrative Assistant, Miss Meuhl, tries to tell him how to do his job, indicating what he can and cannot do. She is defensive of the Groacians, calling them sensitive, cultured, innocent, and gentle yet unsophisticated. She professes deep shame at the way they were treated by the investigators. She has been working in the consulate for four years and considers herself much more knowledgeable than Retief. There was a Terrestrial ship, the ISV Terrific, that went missing in their sector nine years ago, and while the Terrestrials held an investigation and questioned the Groacians, they did not get satisfactory answers. Retief is trying to get those answers.\nTo determine what happened, Retief first tries the Archives and local museum, but Terrestrials are denied entry here. From there, he makes his way to a bar. While the bartender refuses him service, a drunken Groacian calls out for a cage to put Retief in, referring to him as a zoo animal or a freak. When the bartender has the drunk taken out of the bar, Retief follows and beats him to get more information. Later, two government men, Fith from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shluh from the Internal Police, show up at the consulate to question Retief about the beating. He turns their questioning into his own interrogation about the missing ship from nine years ago and the reason for the change in their government right after the investigators left Groac. Retief confronts them with his knowledge that the Terrestrials were put in cages and paraded through the streets and demands to know what happened to them. Fith admits this happened and claims the humans grew ill and died since the Groacians didn\u2019t really know how to keep them alive.\nFith also relates that the government was changed after the inquiry to get rid of the leaders who were involved. To try to cover and make up for their mistakes, they then reached out to the Terrestrials to establish a diplomatic relationship. When Retief asks to see the ship, Fith and Shluh show him a ship hidden in a cavern, but Retief realizes it isn\u2019t the ISV. He confronts the men about this, and they end their cooperation with him. Fith warns Retief to stay close to the consulate.\nKnowing that he has little time left, that night Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry to find evidence and answers to his questions; he is sure they will destroy this information soon. When he returns to the consulate, Miss Meuhl has filed a report against him with the Regional Headquarters, having him relieved of duty and making her acting Consul. Fith and Shluh show up to question Retief about the break-in, and he claims diplomatic immunity, but Miss Meuhl waives his immunity.  \n"

            "The story takes place on the planet Groac, which is populated by the native Groaci. The Groaci is a skinny, pale species with a throat-bladder that vibrates when speaking with a glottal dialect in an unusual syntax. They are a sensitive race, according to Miss Meuhl, and they hide their heads and hurry along at any sign of trouble. Consul Retief has an office in the Terrestrial Consulate General and attends cultural events such as light-concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. Retief suggests that these events are mere distractions from more underhanded business happening on the planet, which explains why visas are handed out for only a few terrestrial businessmen, traveling to outlying districts is forbidden, and social contacts must be limited to the diplomatic circle. Groac also has a moon that foreigners cannot visit. In addition to the Consulate General, other important government agencies exist including the Foreign Office Archives, the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Internal Police (called \"peace-keepers\"). Close to the Consulate General is the bar where Retief goes, seeking a cold drink and information. The bartender stands in the bar-pit and dispenses a Groacian beverage he insists is poisonous to foreigners due to its lead content. Retief brandishes a thick gold piece to act as a filter. Later, Fith and Shluh lead Retief to a crevasse nine miles from the supposed landing point of the ISV Terrific. Due to the large veins of high-grade iron ore, Terrestrial investigators had been unable to detect the cruiser's presence, which had been disguised by a roof of heavy timbers. Retief enters the cruiser via a narrow companionway and sees dust all over the deck, stanchions, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. ",
            "The story takes place on the planet Groac inhabited by the Groaci. Previously undiscovered by humans, the Groaci had their first contact with an alien species just nine years prior to the story beginning. The Groaci use ground cars to travel, though they may be considered flimsy. With a cool temperature and clean air, Groac isn\u2019t a terrible place to live. There are mountainous caverns in the terrain as well, and one serves as the hiding spot for the lost Terrific ISV. Retief visits several places and buildings on Groac, including the Consul, their Ministry of Affairs, and a bar, showing their culture does not differ entirely from Terrestrials. The Groaci are often called simple people, however. They have several cultural events, such as folk festivals, chamber choirs, and light concerts. ",
            "The Madman From Earth is set on the planet of Groac, where the Terrans have had a Terrestrial Consulate General for less than nine years. The consulate contains offices for the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy staff like Retief and Miss Meuhl as well as their living quarters. Relations between the Terrans and the Groacians have been peaceful, but there are some subjects that are off limits to discuss with the Groacians, such as the disappearance of a Terran ship, ISV Terrific, nine years ago. Retief is the new Consul, and is planning on digging into this controversial topic directly with the Groacians, creating a very tense atmosphere.\nIn the city, there are windowless stucco facades on the buildings lining the street, and  the Groacians avoid the Terrans as they pass. There are high-wheeled ground cars and the environment has clean and cool air. Retief enters a Groacian bar that serves clay pots of an alcoholic drink that could harm humans from a pit in the center of the room. When Retief is escorted out of the city by Fith and Shluh, they take him to a natural crevasse with thick veins of high-grade iron ore in the rock that they claim the vessel, ISV Terrific, was lowered into and then it was covered with a roof to avoid detection. The land around the city is dusty like a desert, and Terrans are generally forbidden from traveling through these areas or visiting Groac\u2019s satellite, which is part of their cover-up of what happened to the ISV Terrific.",
            "The story takes place on the planet inhabited by the Groacians, specifically in the Terrestrial Consulate, a bar, and a cavern. The Consul for the Terrestrial States has been open on the planet for almost nine years, opening not long after the ISV Terrific B7 New Terra Terrestrial cruiser went missing in the sector. The Consul is in a building protected by a safelock and communicates with the Regional Headquarters via a video communication system. The Consul has a needle gun for protection and keeps food and water on hand; it has quarters in the building for the staff as well.\n\tGroac is civilized and orderly. The Groacians have an Archives and museum for their local history, but it is off-limits to Terrestrials. Buildings have deeply carved, windowless stucco facades lining the streets, and Groacs travel by flimsy, high-wheeled ground cars. The air on the planet is clean and cool. Carvings over the doorways of buildings indicate the businesses housed within; one such business is a bar. The bar features a bar pit at the center of the room, and drinks are served in clay pots. They have culture, too, with light concerts, chamber music, and folk-art festivals. There is a Foreign Office that handles foreign matters and maintains files regarding its dealings.\n\tThe Groaci, however, have a deep dislike of Terrestrials. They avoid them on the streets, refuse service, and drunkenly slur insults at them. The Groaci government was overhauled after an investigation of a missing cruiser; after this, the Terrestrial consul was established. \n\tRetief is taken to a cavern to see the ISV Terrific, but it turns out not to be the real ISV Terrific. The Groaci authorities claim they hauled it there, nine miles from where it landed, placing it in a natural crevasse and roofing it over with high-grade iron ore. The ship has curving flanks and a space-burned hull. The instrument panels are empty, bolts have been sheared, scraps of paper and wire are lying around. Cutting torches have been used to remove the heavy shielding.\n"

Fith does most of the talking as he attempts to convince Retief to cease his inquiries into the ISV Terrific, and Shluh is there primarily as a tool with which to threaten Retief. When the two Groacians first meet Retief, they accuse him of attacking a Groacian national, which Retief admits to, but he quickly reveals what the national confessed to him about the fate of ISV Terrific's crew. Although Miss Meuhl is sympathetic to the supposed sensitive nature of the Groaci, Retief distrusts them wholly, and when Fith and Shluh eventually confess to hiding the ISV Terrific, he further distrusts their sincerity of contrition and accuses them of showing him a lifeboat instead of the missing cruiser. This accusation infuriates Fith, who threatens to have Shluh's attending officers arrest Retief on the spot.

Fith and Shluh accompany Retief on his journey of discovering the mystery of the ISV Terrific crash and human discovery on Groac. Although at first they try and hide what happened, Retief soon learns the truth about those Terrestrials. Fith reveals that all six of the Terrestrials used in the parade died due to malnourishment and the Groaci\u2019s unfamiliarity with the needs of humans. Although Fith and Shluh help Retief in some ways, they also greatly hinder the process by attempting to keep this all under wraps.

Fith\u2019s role is largely to protect the interests of the planet Groac, who Retief is threatening with his offensive investigations into the disappearance of the ISV Terrific, which Groacians claim the Terrans falsely accuse them of capturing nine years ago. Although Fith admits to the cover up of the vessel, it appears he is concealing a much larger secret that Retief uncovers when he notices they are showing him only a small lifeboat from ISV Terrific and claiming that they know nothing further. Then, Fith and Shuhl become forceful and violent with Retief when he presses about the heavy cruising ship - the real ISV Terrific - that the small lifeboat came from. \nShluh commands the Internal Police, and enforces the wishes of Fith faithfully throughout the story. This is seen when Shluh and four of his constables apprehend Retief at the cavern and forcefully escort him back to the city, and again when they enter the Terran consulate armed to take Retief into custody.\n",

Retief reveals that the drunken man told him certain information, and Fith indicates he will ask for Retief\u2019s recall and claims he would do more if Retief didn\u2019t have diplomatic immunity. While Retief tells them what he knows and then inquires how the people from the ISV Terrific died, proffering several suggestions, Fith becomes so worked up that he begins answering the questions. He admits the humans died from illness but claims the Groacians tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know how. He also asserts that the Groacians were unaware of the severity of their actions until the investigation was held. They were afraid to tell what had happened and hid the ship. When the investigators left, they replaced their government and opened diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. To persuade Retief of their sincerity, Fith offers to show Retief the ship and takes him to a ship hidden in a cavern. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific and confronts Fith with this fact, leading Shluh to have his four armed constables surround Retief. Fith then warns Retief not to go far from the consulate and to drop his inquiries about the government. At the end of the story, the two men come to the consulate to remove Retief for questioning and respond to Miss Meuhl as Consul now. "

            "The ISV Terrific, full name ISV Terrific B7 New Terra, was a Terrestrial cruiser gone missing nine years prior to the events of the story. The vessel landed on Groac and its crew was captured and paraded through the streets by the Groaci. The crew died of mysterious causes and the vessel was hidden in a cavern and undetectable by investigators thanks to large veins of high-grade iron ore under the planet's surface. After a Terrestrial investigation failed to uncover the cruiser, a Groacian coup d'etat replaced the government in the time before the establishment of the Terrestrial Consulate General. Fith and Shluh deny any wrongdoing related to the deaths of the crewmembers when Retief confronts them about the situation, insisting that the crew died because the Groaci were ignorant about the Terran diet. They do, however, admit that they hid the cruiser. When they lead Retief to the ship, he observes its state of disrepair: A thick layer of dust covers the deck, stanchions, acceleration couches, instrument panels, sheared bolts, and scraps of wire and paper strewn about the control compartment. Then, Retief accuses them of attempting to continue their deception by showing him a lifeboat instead of the actual cruiser. This enrages Fith. The disappearance of the ISV Terrific, the coup d'etat that followed, and the subsequent incompetent Terrestrial investigation had led Retief to conduct the investigation in the first place and ultimately reveal that the Groacians are trying to hide something more sinister.",
            "The ISV Terrific is a Terrestrial spaceship that crashed on Groac nine years before the story begins. It is significant because it marks the first Terrestrial contact with the Groaci, in fact, the first alien contact at all. The crew of the ISV Terrific were captured and paraded through the streets like animals in a zoo. They all later died due to malnourishment and dehydration, or so the Groaci claim. The ISV Terrific is significant because it acts as the catalyst for much of the conflict in this story, as Retief sets down a path to discover the truth and reveal what was long ago covered up. ",
            "The ISV Terrific was a heavy, interplanetary cruising vessel, weighing about twenty thousand tons, that was mysteriously lost on the planet Groac nine years ago. When the Terrans questioned the Grocians about their vessel, the Groacians covered up the fact that the ship did land on their planet to the east of the city and there were humans that all died after falling ill because the Groacians did not understand what to feed them. \nThe ISV Terrific is significant in the story because it is Retief\u2019s singular focus to solve its disappearance. Retief is highly suspicious of why his fellow colleagues at the consulate are afraid to investigate the incident any further.  The Groacians treat the incident as an embarrassment, as if the Terrans had wrongly accused them. But Retief is intent on getting to the bottom of it. At first, he is able to get some information from Fith, who admits to covering up the ship and the death of the humans that fell ill. When Retief arrives at the cavern that the Groacians have hidden the ship in, he uncovers a further mystery. The ship they show him is only a hundred-ton lifeboat of the ISV Terrific, marked 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra\u2019 on the bow. The real ISV Terrific is somewhere else.\nRetief does not give up on his quest, despite the threats of the Groacian officials, and pushes on into the night by breaking into the Archives to obtain the records from nine years ago to find out where the ISV Terrific is.\n",
            "The ISV Terrific is the reason for Retief\u2019s appointment as Consul on Groac. The ship was a Terrestrial cruiser that went missing nine years ago in the Groaci sector of the galaxy. Consul Retief is trying to track down the ship and discover what happened to the passengers. He suspects that the ship crashed on the Groaci\u2019s planet and that the Groaci killed the people on it. He is on a mission to answer these questions. He first asks Miss Meuhl what she knows about it. She refuses to discuss it, siding with the Groacis and defending them as a very sensitive race and stating she is ashamed of how they were treated when the investigation was conducted. Retief tries to enter the Archives and local museum to search for information but is denied entry. \nBut he stumbles on a clue in a bar when a drunken Groaci points at him and says they need to find a proper cage for him; Retief follows the drunk out of the bar and learns that the Groaci captured the passengers and caged, paraded, and exhibited them. Fith and Shluh admit that these Terrestrials died but that the Groaci tried to keep them alive but didn\u2019t know what foods they ate. They fell ill one by one and died. The Groaci claim that they didn\u2019t realize the significance of the humans until the warships came to investigate, and then the Groaci were afraid to say anything. Afterward, they got rid of their government, replaced it with a new one, hid the ship, and invited diplomatic relations with the Terrestrials. Fith and Shluh also reveal that the ship didn\u2019t crash but landed intact and claim that the ship is hidden in a cavern now and offer to show it to Retief. However, Retief recognizes that the ship they show him is not the ISV Terrific  but is, instead, a lifeboat. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Retief breaks into the Foreign Ministry during the night and finds answers to his questions, but before he can transmit the information that he has learned, Miss Meuhl notifies the Regional Headquarters of his actions, having him removed as consul, and allows the Groaci into the consulate to take Retief into custody.\nThus, the ISV Terrific is the basis for interplanetary hostilities, the opening of a diplomatic channel between the Groacians and the Terrestrials, the overthrow of the Groaci government, and an unsolved mystery that could reopen hostilities when the truth of the matter is revealed.\n"

            "Miss Yolanda Meuhl is the Administrative Assistant of The Consul for the Terrestrial States Retief, the replacement for Consul Whaffle who left the post three months prior. Miss Meuhl wears glasses, uses a dictyper, and takes her position at the Consulate extremely seriously. She faithfully executes her duties as an administrative assistant without question, which leads her to develop a blind trust in authority as well as the Groaci race, according to Retief.  Miss Meuhl considers the Groaci to be a sensitive race and defends them against Retief's constant accusations of misconduct. She threatens to report Retief to the Regional Headquarters when he continues to act against the guidelines set forth by the Corps. Her commitment to diplomatic relations ensures that she takes the side of the Groaci in nearly every matter; she even excuses when Fith and Shluh admit to hiding the Terrestrial cruiser. When Retief orders Miss Meuhl to lock herself inside the office while he goes to break into the Foreign Ministry, Miss Meuhl calls the Regional Headquarters and makes a full report of his actions. When he returns, Counsellor Pardy calls and relieves Retief of his post. Then, a Groacian official calls and appoints Miss Meuhl to the post vacated by Retief, which she accepts. She then allows the Groacian officials to enter the office in order to arrest Retief.",
            "Miss Meuhl is Retief\u2019s secretary and administrative assistant at the Groac Embassy for Terrestrials. She is used to serving the former consul, Whaffle, who was happy to go along with all the cultural ploys and let her do much of the writing. Retief, however, takes things into his own hands and immediately starts investigating a covered-up crime. Miss Meuhl does not approve of his actions and argues with Retief throughout the entire story. In the end, Miss Meuhl essentially betrays his trust and allows the Groaci to take Retief away, making her the new Consul. She would rather side with them to keep the peace than discover the truth, a trait that Retief abhorred. ",
            "Miss Yolanda Meuhl, DAO-9 is the Administrative Assistant to the Terran diplomat within the Ministry of Culture of the Groacian Autonomy, stationed at the Terrestrial Consulate General of the planet Groac. She used to serve Consul Whaffle, who was replaced with Consul Retief three months ago. She is not happy about assisting Retief, who she feels is deeply unfit to be a diplomat. She objects to nearly everything that Retief does during the course of the story, and only obliges when the task might gain her some information she can use against Retief in the future. Such as when she obliges to record the conversation Retief has with Fith and Shuhl when they question him about the drunkard he beat up. Or when she accepts locking herself in their consulate office when Retief goes to investigate the whereabouts of the vessel Terrific against the will of the Groacian officials, so that she can transmit a report to get Retief dismissed to their Regional Headquarters. After she turns against Retief, she is assigned his position as Consul by the Regional Headquarters and plays the role of a villain when she immediately betrays Retief by waiving his diplomatic protections before the Groacian authorities.",
            "Miss Meuhl is the Administrative Assistant to the Consul for the Terrestrial States on Groac. She has held that position for over four years and believes she knows better than Consul Retief, who has only been there three months, what he should do and say. She frequently references the previous Consul as an example of what Retief should do and how he should act. When Retief brings up questions about the replacement of the government and the Groacis\u2019 role in the missing ISV Terrific, Miss Meuhl sides with the Groaci, stating that they are a very sensitive, cultured, gentle race and were treated very poorly during the inquiry that followed the disappearance of the ship. When Fith and Shluh arrive to question Retief about his role in beating a Groaci, she is appalled. She refuses to be a party to his conversation with the authorities until Retief forces her because he needs her to record the discussion. When Retief leaves with the authorities to see the ship, he trusts Miss Meuhl to transmit the recording to the Regional Headquarters if he doesn\u2019t return in a reasonable amount of time. When Retief later continues his investigation under cover of night, he warns Miss Meuhl she is in danger and not to leave the consulate; he also warns her not to trust the Groaci. While he is gone, Miss Meuhl reports his activities to the Regional Headquarters, having him dismissed from his post and replaced by Miss Meuhl. When Groaci authorities arrive to question Retief, they already know that Miss Meuhl is in charge. She unlocks the safelock so that they can enter, and she revokes Retief\u2019s diplomatic immunity and has them remove Retief from the office area. Miss Meuhl thwarts Retief every step of the way as he tries to learn the truth about the people who were on the ISV Terrific and ultimately gains his consulate post for herself.\n"

            "Herrell McCray is a navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank heading for the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine when he is inexplicably abducted from his ship. He finds himself staring around a dark, silent room full of indeterminate objects. He believes he hears a faint voice in the distance, and suddenly a pinkish light illuminates his path of vision. He sees many familiar objects including a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a girl's bathing suit, and more; he wonders how he got there and why such objects are there with him. Three of the room's walls are made of a hard, organic compound, and from grates comprising the fourth wall pours a pungent air. As McCray's confidence returns, he wonders what happened to the Starship Jodrell Bank and begins to wonder if he is dead. When he remembers spacesuits come with radios, he tries contacting the ship to no avail and realizes he must be many lightyears away. Then, with sudden horror, he realizes that he cannot see his own body, and the room goes dark again. Outside the room, an alien named \"Hatcher\" runs a probe team tasked with observing McCray and running experiments on him in order to develop an understanding of the human species. Their \"probes\" are mandibles that can attach and detach from their round, jelly-like bodies and run errands and conduct scientific research. Hatcher makes his way to the supervising council of all probes to report the team's findings that McCray displayed \"paranormal powers\" when using his radio to establish contact with his ship. The council urges Hatcher to continue his studies with haste because a member of The Central Masses probe team has been captured by the Old Ones, an ancient species hostile to Hatcher's people. His team must put McCray through a series of tests in order to help them potentially discover a way to defend themselves against the Old Ones. As Hatcher considers the best way to establish communication with McCray without causing him harm, his assistant alerts him to the presence of a female human on the viewing console. Hatcher orders the assistant to bring her in as they may need another human in case McCray dies. Hours after his initial transmission was sent to the ship, McCray receives a response from the ship. He dispatches another transmission and begins to notice the room getting hotter as the air grows more toxic. Hatcher has started the survival portion of the test. McCray uses an ax to break his way out of the room and enters another dark room full of desks he assumes are some kind of workspaces for his captors. Suddenly, he hears a woman's voice crying out for the Jodrell Bank and makes his way toward her. Hatcher and his assistant discuss whether to abandon McCray and focus on the female since she appears to be more susceptible to communication, but they ultimately decide against it. McCray eventually finds the woman through a series of doors and hallways.",
            "Herrell McCray is the navigator on Starship Jodrell Bank on a long haul flight from Earth to the colonies of Betelgeuse Nine. During a routine course check, he suddenly teleports into a dark and scary room filled with a strange melange of objects - from a spacesuit to a woman\u2019s bathing suit. Some he recognizes from his early life, like a childhood rocking chair. He calls for help on the ultrawave radio of the spacesuit, but there is no answer, telling him he is a long way from anything since the range of the radio is hundreds of light-years. McCray is being observed from another room by an alien Probe Team led by Hatcher. They are watching McCray\u2019s every action with fascination. They think he has paranormal powers when he operates the radio and they detect electromagnetic vibrations that are modified by his voice. Hatcher rushes to tell a councillor from the supervising council of all the alien probes about the discovery and he is ordered to establish contact with McCray immediately because they need allies in the race of Old Ones (their word for humans). Hatcher defends going at a slow pace since they have frightened McCray so deeply already, but the concillor does not budge since there has been an incident of one of their staff on the Central Masses probe team getting captured by their human subject. Hatcher\u2019s people are capturing humans from Jodrell Bank because they detected it near their territory and were almost completely destroyed when they last encountered humans. They are now desperate to find ways to fight or escape them.\nBack in McCray\u2019s observation room, he hears a faint voice responding from his ship via the spacesuit radio. This gives him hope, but also panic because he calculates that he must be more than five hundred light-years away from his ship for such a long lag. He radios back, but knows there will be no response for several more hours. The room suddenly gets very hot and a chlorine-like gas is being pumped in that burns his lungs. He quickly puts on the spacesuit which will keep him cool and filter the air, then picks up an axe and breaks out of the room into a hallway. He finds the parts of an antique bullet gun on a bench outside, and then hears a woman scream out to Jodrell Bank for help on his radio.\nThe heat and chlorine gas are a survival test, and McCray passes. McCray uses his radio to locate the woman. He notices that there is a new door where there was not one before. Hatcher has engineered this so that McCray will find the woman and they can study them communicating with each other. Hatcher thinks this is a step toward successful contact with humans. McCray finds the woman face down on the floor. She wears coveralls and he believes she may be Chinese. McCray wonders if she has asphyxiated by breathing the air in the room.\n",
            "An unnamed alien race has abducted the navigator, Herrell McCray, from a ship to use him to help save their race. They plan to test his intelligence and then communicate with him, making him an ally to perhaps work as an intermediary between their race and the Old Ones. They call the human race the Old Ones, and many years ago, they had an encounter with them that left the aliens fleeing for their survival and ending up having to abandon their populated planet. The problem now is that the humans are sending out mapping parties that are getting dangerously close to where the aliens live now. The probe team observing McCray is led by Hatcher; his team observes everything McCray does and reports significant findings to the supervising council overall probe teams.\n\tAnother one of their probe teams has lost a member of their team to the Old Ones, and now the aliens are worried about what the Old Ones will learn and what they will do. For this reason, they are having to step up the pace of their work with McCray, even though Hatcher is worried about somehow harming him. They have tried working with other humans in the past, but they have all died during the stages of their tests.\n\tThe probe team acquires another test subject, a female, who begins calling out for help. McCray hears her and begins making his way to her. She is unconscious when he finds her, and he suspects that it is from breathing the air in the building. The aliens have not communicated with her either, yet, but believe they are beginning to establish the start of communication. They believe McCray and the female will communicate with each other, which might help them establish communication with McCray.\n",
            "Herrel McCray, the navigator on the Jodrell Bank, wakes up to find himself in a dark room. He stumbles around for a bit before a pink glow lights up parts of the room. He sifts through the items on the floor, objects from Earth mostly, and looks at the metal walls. One of the three walls is made up of an organic plastic compound, but the rest are impenetrable. He sees a spacesuit and uses its microphone to emit a distress signal to Jodrell Bank. He hears nothing in response, meaning he must be hundreds of light-years away from them. Suddenly, the light goes out, but not before he realized he couldn\u2019t see his reflection in the spacesuit. As he freaks out, the reader is introduced to Hatcher, the lead alien probe of the team observing Herrel. He and his probe team believe that Hatcher has paranormal powers because he differs so greatly from their blob-like race. Hatcher reports back to the supervising council and informs them of the Earthman\u2019s doings, specifically his ability to speak through his throat. They order him to establish communication quickly, since the Central Masses Team just sent out the message that one of their probes is missing, presumably killed by their test subject. Hatcher thinks they\u2019re moving too fast since their previous subjects didn\u2019t survive. He goes to the eating room, removes his previous day\u2019s digested food from his slit, and puts in new vegetation. His assistant sends him an image telepathically of another human, this time a woman, that they had just captured. Hatcher informs his team they must move into Stage Two. Herrell hears a click, feels the room get warmer, and smells something unpleasant. He turns on the light in the spacesuit and is relieved to see his body. Jodrell Bank calls him back, so he sends in a long message explaining his situation. He hears nothing back. He climbs into the spacesuit, realizing the air is toxic, and lets the spacesuit provide fresh air. He grabs an ax off the floor and uses it to break out of the poisonous room. Once out, he tries to open a cupboard in the new area but is unable to. He sees a pistol that had been taken apart before. Jodrell Bank calls back in, but this time a woman responds, calling for help. McCray communicates with her and tracks her using her descriptions. He runs around the compound, trying to find her, and eventually goes through a door that was previously unopened. He finally finds her, unconscious on the floor. "

            "The story begins sometime during the Starship Jodrell Bank's Long Jump from Earth to the colonies surrounding Betegeuses Nine as it passes by Betelgeuse, Rigel, and Saiph. The rest of the action takes place in an unknown area of space within a \"great buried structure\" that is a massive labyrinth of dark rooms and hallways with unusual doors that seem to shift and change after passing through them. This is where Hatcher and his probe team observe McCray in his enclosure, which is no bigger than a prison cell, dark, and full of vaguely familiar objects: a spacesuit, a child's rocking chair, a chemistry set, a girl's bathing suit, an ax. Three of the walls are made of a hard, organic compound and the fourth is covered in grates from which a halogen-smelling air pours out into the room. Although everything is dark, Hatcher occasionally triggers a pinkish, halo-like light that allows McCray to examine his surroundings. Elsewhere in the structure is a place where the supervising council of all probes stays in permanent session, monitoring the work of all probe teams including the team at The Central Masses. When McCray breaks out of his initial enclosure, he finds himself in another dark room, large and bare. Using the beam from his suit lamp, he sees shelves, cupboard-like contraptions, and level surfaces that appeared to be waist-high workbenches attached to the walls and ceiling. He finds a gun on one of the benches. After finding the gun, he realizes the door he came through is gone; instead, there is an uneven, three-sided door he enters to find the unconscious woman on the other side.",
            "The story is set in a time when humans have interstellar travel and are mapping new galaxies. They are feared by at least some of the aliens they have encountered, such as Hatcher\u2019s people who were almost completely wiped out after their last human contact. The aliens are so fearful now that they have abandoned a planet as a decoy for the humans and are capturing humans off the Starship Jodrell Bank that they\u2019ve detected in their galaxy to probe them and find out ways to fight or escape humans for good.\nWhen McCray is captured, he awakes in a strange room with three walls made of a hard organic compound, and one wall made of grates that a pungent halogen smell came out of. There is a dim pink light in the room, and it is filled with meaningful objects from McCray\u2019s past and present that he thinks of like a creepy trophy room of his life. Importantly there is a modern spacesuit that saves his life when the aliens administer a survival test that heats the room and pumps in chlorine gas through the grates. Directly outside of this room is a sterile hallway and the rest of the testing facilities of the aliens. There are other rooms similar to his where other humans are being probed by the aliens, such as the woman he hears screaming through the radio of his space suit who is in a nearby room.\nHatcher, the alien in charge of conducting the Probe Team to make contact with the humans, observes them with his team of scientists and they take detailed notes on their actions that are reported to the supervisory council of probes in another nearby room.\n",
            "The story is set in the spiral arm of the galaxy where the aliens who abduct McCray are living. McCray is abducted from the Starship Jodrell Bank where he is navigator as the ship is on a trip from Earth to the colonies in Betelgeuse Nine. McCray is on the ship one minute, and the next, he is in a completely dark room full of unidentifiable objects. Unknown to him, the objects have been selected by the aliens as ones that are on McCray\u2019s ship to give him a homey setting. McCray has been trying to feel the objects and his surroundings to determine where he is. When he calls out in frustration because he can\u2019t see, they light up a spacesuit that gives him enough illumination to see the objects that include a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old fashioned children\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set, and a girl\u2019s bathing suit. Three of the walls, the floor, and the room's ceiling are an unusual substance, possibly cellulose. The fourth wall is grated like a ventilation system, and there is a faint smell of halogen gases lingering in the room. The spacesuit has a radio which McCray uses to contact his ship, but it doesn\u2019t respond immediately. \n\tFrom another room, McCray is being observed by Hatcher and his probe team. Hatcher isn\u2019t exactly male; his race doesn\u2019t have them, but he isn\u2019t female either. He is a three-foot sphere-shaped glob of jelly covered with a hard shell. His arms and legs are not attached but rather are snakelike structures that obey his brain. They work best close to the body but can work up to a fourth of a mile from it. Hatcher\u2019s appendages are the calmest ones in the room.\n\tThe building where all this takes place is located underground. The supervising council is located in the same building, and Hatcher can move from his observation room to the council\u2019s room in a matter of minutes. Due to the lag in transmission time and message reception, McCray believes he is somewhere around five hundred light-years away from his ship.\n",

Herrel McCray wakes up to a dark prison cell filled with Earthly items, such as a book or a bathing suit. This tiny cell has three impenetrable walls, and then the fourth is made of something similar to plastic. He cuts into the fourth wall with an ax and escapes the room only to arrive in a new one. This one features cupboards with the same impenetrable surfaces and an antique pistol that had been previously taken apart. As Herrel makes his way through the story, the reader sees very little of the compound they\u2019re keeping him in, as there is presumably not a lot of light.

            "Hatcher is an alien of an unnamed race. He cannot be described as male because his race \"had no true males.\" He is three feet tall with a hard-shelled, circular body of jelly. His arms and legs are snakelike mandibles that can detach from his body, and he can control them with his brain from vast distances, although their effectiveness diminishes the further they travel from Hatcher's body. When they return to Hatcher's body, they rest in crevices in his skin. When he feeds, a slit appears at the bottom of his body and emits a thin, fetid fluid Hatcher throws away; he then places a nutrient-filled, kelp-like vegetable in the slit for sustenance. Hatcher is young, adventurous, scientifically gifted, knowledgeable, and enjoys playing sports. Although he does not feel the equivalent of human empathy, he also doesn't want harm to befall McCray and feels responsible for his proper care. Hatcher manages the probe team that observes McCray throughout the story, and he reports on McCray's behavior and his use of \"paranormal powers\" to the supervising council. Hatcher worries about hurrying to establish communication with McCray because he believes it will harm and perhaps even kill him, and later he wonders if communication is even possible at all with humans (later, he notes he is able to establish a minor level of communication with the female but wonders if others might be able to communicate with her). When Hatcher makes his report to the supervising council, they inform him of the return of the Old Ones, who have captured a member of The Central Masses Probe Team. He questions whether or not to tell his crew considering he was never explicitly told not to by the council. In many ways, Hatcher and McCray are similar although Hatcher is generally disgusted by the human body.",

They are now probing humans from McCray\u2019s ship, Starship Jodrell Bank, because they have detected the human mapping mission in the spiral arm of their galaxy and are afraid of another encounter. They are looking for ways to fight or to escape humans for good, and have abandoned one of their planets as a precautionary decoy to avoid an encounter.\nHatcher runs one of the alien Probe Teams, and McCray is one of his human subjects. Hatcher is an adventurous, young scientist who enjoys games and sports, and he is in a position of importance - reporting only to a Councillor of the supervising council of all probes. Hatcher is a three foot diameter sphere with a hard shell and jelly interior. He possesses arms and legs but they are not attached to the sphere of his body. He controls those appendages with his brain telepathically, such that they can be operating in one room when he is in another. He doesn\u2019t want to harm his subjects, including McCray, because they are difficult to acquire. Hatcher doesn\u2019t necessarily have emotions, but he can comprehend human feelings and knows when McCray is in distress during the experiments. Hatcher\u2019s role is essential to his people making contact with humans and finding ways to deal with them so that they don\u2019t have to continue living through generations of fear about being wiped out by them. ",
            "Hatcher leads the probe team observing Herrell McCray and testing him when he discovers that McCray has paranormal powers (which are actually his voice and the radio microphone). Once he realizes this, he immediately takes the news to the supervising council. After discussing the new information, the council orders Hatcher to establish communication with McCray immediately. They explain that the Central Masses team has just lost one of their probe team to the Old Ones, so the danger is even greater than before, and time is running out. Hatcher is reluctant to push McCray for fear of causing harm to him, but the council lets him know they are facing an emergency. Hatcher informs his team the council is ordering them to move to Stage Two. They increase the heat and pour a halogen gas into the room and watch as McCray uses the spacesuit for protection and breaks out of the room using the space-ax. This means that McCray has passed the first survival test. When the female subject cries out in pain, Hatcher watches with interest as McCray makes his way to her. He thinks that the female and McCray are communicating with each other. Hatcher\u2019s team adds a door to the room McCray is in so that he can find the female, and Hatcher is pleased that McCray has made it this far in their test.\n",

He eats through a slit lower on his body, which processes vegetation and then essentially pees it out. He is fairly young, but also very intelligent and capable. Hatcher acts as the commander over the team of probes that are testing and observing Herrel McCray. He, of course, reports to the Council who oversee several different probe operations. Hatcher does not want to kill the Earthmen and believes they are moving too fast with their tests. "

When Hatcher\u2019s people once again detected that there were humans on a mapping mission in their spiral arm of the galaxy, they formed Probe Teams to capture and study the humans. The success of the probes in establishing contact with the humans is essential to them understanding how to protect their people from the fear they live under.\n",
            "The probes are being carried out in an effort to find an ally among the Old Ones (humans) in order to save the beings of Orion. They had an encounter with the Old Ones years ago, and their race had almost been destroyed. They had to run and hide, take a populated planet with them, and then abandon it. Now the Old Ones are sending out mapping teams near their planet, and they are running out of time. The Probe Teams are trying to find a way to combat the Old Ones or else run from them again. Time is growing shorter because now the Central Masses have taken someone from one of their probe teams, so they might be getting the information to destroy them. ",
            "The probes cause the main conflict in this story: the kidnapping and testing of two humans. The probes are worried that human domination will occur again and their species will be murdered or forced out of their homes. They plan to learn more about these humans, so they can destroy them, know their plans, or know when to run. The probes kidnap Herrel McCray from the Jodrell Bank and put him through a series of tests to better understand his race. Evidently, they have done this before, for Hatcher speaks of previous test subjects who all died during the first test. "

He is young, adventurous, gifted in science and technology, and enjoys playing baseball, poker, and 3D chess. When McCray finds himself inexplicably abducted and transported to a dark room in an unknown location, he is confused about how he ended up in that location and why he is surrounded by items that vaguely remind him of his childhood. He is grateful when a pinkish light offers some illumination, and he attempts to contact his ship using the radio on a spacesuit he finds in the room. Before the light goes out, he panics when he is not able to see any part of his body; he later realizes this was a trick of the light. McCray continues to attempt to make contact with the ship and hours go by before he receives a reply, which makes him realize he is possibly millions of lightyears away from it. As McCray realizes his room is slowly filling with toxic fumes, he uses an ax he finds to break free and tries to find a way to escape his unknown prison. As he navigates the unusual building, he finds a gun and eventually hears a transmission from an unknown woman who is also calling out for the ship. He makes his way through bizarre doors until he finds her face down on the ground. ",
            "Herrell McCray is a navigator on the interstellar mapping vessel Jodrell Bank. He is a logical, mathematical thinker. During a routine course check on his way from Earth to the colonies of Betelgeuse Nine, he suddenly is no longer at his navigation station, but instead in a dark room that stinks of halogen compounds. The room is like a dark, scary, trophy room full of meaningful objects from McCray\u2019s past and present. He has been captured by an alien race that is studying humans to try to make contact with them to determine how to fight or escape them, and they\u2019ve put him in this room with artificial objects to try to make McCray calm so they can run tests. He tries the radio on a spacesuit in the room several times. He receives a message from his ship several hours later that gives him a glimmer of hope for rescue, but he calculates that he must be five hundred light years away from them to account for the hours-long lag between messages. When the room begins heating up and chlorine gas begins burning his lungs as the aliens administer a survival test, he quickly gets into the spacesuit and breaks out of the room with a large space axe. He passes the survival test without knowing it. He hears a woman scream for help on his radio and he realizes she is also in the facility and goes to her. He finds her unconscious, face down on the floor from possible asphyxiation.\n",
            "Herrell McCray is the ship\u2019s navigator on the Starship Jodrell Bank. On a routine mission from Earth to the colonies circling Betelgeuse Nine, he visually confirms the navigation's locking mechanism when he suddenly finds himself in a completely dark room filled with various objects. He tries to explore the objects with his hands but in frustration, calls out that he wishes he could see, and there is a flicker of pinkish light from a spacesuit. With the light available to him, he looks at the other objects in the room: a set of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, a space-ax, an old-fashioned child\u2019s rocking chair, a chemistry set\u2026.The objects are somewhat familiar, many of which he had owned himself. Three walls are solid, but the fourth seems to be a grating, perhaps a ventilator. McCray recalls that spacesuits have radios, so he tries to contact his ship but receives no answer. He thinks about the speed of radio transmissions and realizes he must be far away from his ship not to receive an immediate reply. \n\tUnknown to McCray, he has been selected for observation and an experiment by a probe team. They are testing his intelligence and need to communicate with McCray to find an ally; otherwise, their species is in great danger. McCray decides to put the spacesuit on just as the room begins warming up and a gas starts coming into the room. Then he hears a transmission from his ship, but he realizes they can\u2019t hear him when he responds to it. It dawns on him that the distance between him and his ship is so great that it takes two or three hours to transmit messages. After sending another message, he uses the space-ax to break through the door of the room because the gas is hurting his lungs. He finds himself in another room or hallway with what appear to be workbenches mounted at various heights. On one he sees the parts of a bullet-gun.\n\tNext, McCray hears a woman calling for help. He tries to determine the direction of her voice, and when he turns around, there is an open door where there wasn\u2019t one earlier. McCray goes down a hall, finds another open door, and the woman is in there. She is unconscious, and McCray thinks it\u2019s because she is breathing the air in the room.\n",
            "Herrel McCray is the navigator on the Jodrell Bank, heading to Betelgeuse Nine from Earth. McCray is an avid sportsman, enjoying games like poker, 3-D chess, and baseball. Herrel McCray suddenly wakes up in an unfamiliar, dark room. He does not remember how he got there, in fact, his last memories were of being aboard the Jodrell Bank. After stumbling around in the dark, a faint pink glow partially illuminates his surroundings. He sees a bunch of random items, like books, a bathing suit, and a rocking chair. There\u2019s also a spacesuit, which he uses to attempt to communicate with his ship by accessing the microphone. No one responds to his cries though, and he notices that he is unable to see his hands in the reflection of the spacesuit. He screams and darkness falls again. Later, remembering another aspect of the handy-dandy spacesuit, Herrel flicks on the light inside of it and is now able to see the entire room. He is also able to see his own body again, which calms him down. He feels the temperature increase, smells a weird, halogenic-like scent, and hears a buzzing, but he ignores it as his spacesuit starts speaking. Someone aboard the Jodrell Bank is calling for him, so he responds, but there\u2019s no answer. He realizes that he must be hundreds of light-years away for communication to be taking this long. Realizing there\u2019s poison in the air, he steps inside the spacesuit to avoid suffocation. The suit cooled him and provided fresh air. He picks up an ax off the floor and uses it to chop down the door. He escapes his cell and explores the next room. Jodrell Bank calls in again, but this time a woman answers it, also calling for help. He tracked her voice and went through a previously-unopened door to find her. She\u2019s unconscious, and he worries that she has breathed in the poisonous air. "

            "A Gleeb for Earth is a collection of letters, signed by two characters - Ivan Smernda (a human on Earth who owns the Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City) and Glmpauszn (an alien from a world that is entwined with Earth through a spiritual fringe). \nIvan dictates the first letter through his son Ronnie (14 years old) and sends it to the Editor of a print publication, feeling responsible for publicizing what he witnessed to save humanity. Ivan recounts an occurrence in the Plaza Ritz Arms where two alcoholic guests that he calls \u201cstew bums\u201d, Joe Binkle and Ed Smith (an alias for Glmpauszn), mysteriously disappeared, leaving their suits behind as if they had melted out of them. Ed had checked in with a mirror with a heavy bronze frame. After their disappearance, Ivan found only their clothes, the frame of the mirror in Ed\u2019s room, and a stack of letters in the bureau in Joe\u2019s room, which are the letters that tell the remaining story.\nThe vibrational plane of an alien world extends into Earth\u2019s (which they call the not-world), allowing intrusive vibrations from Earth to semi-terrorize sentient alien vibrations. Human spiritual mediums can force psychic reproductions of themselves into the alien world, and conversely pull alien vibrations over the \u201cfringe\u201d. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate it, and send Glmpauszn and Joe to take on human form and develop a chemical weapon to kill all humans.\nGlmpauszn crosses the fringe through a vibrational gateway that allows his consciousness to move into a newborn baby. Joe has already arrived in human form. Glmpauszn quickly grows the baby into an adult man. At three days old, he is 36 inches tall and talking, and a couple of days later is an adult man. Glmpauszn writes to Joe by controlling the minds of sleeping people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. He wonders why Joe won\u2019t write to him, and can\u2019t contact him spiritually, like normal, since Joe has fallen into alcoholism. Glmpauszn forgets to wear clothes and is nearly arrested, but escapes by becoming invisible. When Joe finally writes, it is to ask for money, enraging Glmpauszn who reports Joe\u2019s actions to their boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn becomes distracted by exploring human emotions like intimacy with women and love of money, which causes him to rob a bank and fill 18 rooms of a hotel with money. He also falls into alcoholism. Blgftury is accidentally summoned into a seance by a human medium who pulls Blgftury\u2019s vibrations through the fringe (the very thing they are trying to stop from happening), and Glmpauszn is caught with a red-haired woman by his boss not doing his job. Glmpauszn finally develops a mold that can kill humans, and meets with Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms with lots of gin that they consume before successfully returning to the vibrational frequency of their world, releasing the mold in the room.\n",
            "\n\tThe story begins with a letter to the editor of a magazine describing two unusual incidents in a hotel in New York. In both cases, two men checked into the hotel and then mysteriously disappeared, leaving all of their belongings behind, including the clothes they were wearing. The man who owns the hotel doesn\u2019t want to involve the police for fear of reprisals against him; therefore, he sends the letters to the magazine, hoping they will print them. \n\tThe rest of the story is a series of letters, all addressed to Joe Binkle but written in different handwritings and from other parts of the US and the world. They trace the progress of a being named Glmpauszn who, in the first letter, is preparing to be born so that he can enter human society. Once he is born, he grows quickly, and within days, he escapes the hospital and hides in a cave until he has grown into a man. At that point, he makes his way to a chemist to procure the chemicals he needs for his mission: to destroy humanity for encroaching on his world. He walks down the street trying to act normal, but a young lady sees him and begins screaming: he has forgotten to wear clothes. Glmpauszn blames part of his failure on Joe, who apparently is supposed to provide him with the background information he needs to succeed.\n\tGlmpauszn often comments that he has yet to receive a return letter from Joe, but when he does, he complains that Joe has asked him for a $5.00 loan. Glmpauszn refuses the loan initially, making much of the fact that Joe didn\u2019t greet him or express pleasure at his arrival. Glmpauszn alludes to the fact that humans have encroached on their world through the use of mediums or spiritualists. \n\tGlmpauszn takes time to experience various aspects of humanity, including emotions and impressions, such as love of money, love, beauty, pain, etc. He thinks he is on the verge of love until he suggests a biological exploration of it and the women say yes, leading him to conclude it isn\u2019t love. In the meantime, Glmpauszn drinks more and more and accidentally sets off an explosion in his hotel rooms. \n\tGlmpauszn keeps Joe up to date on what he is doing but complains about Blgrtury\u2019s criticism and demands for reports. Finally, Glmpauszn tells Joe that he has successfully created a mold that will destroy humans by dissolving their brains and then their bodies. He also tells Joe to meet him at his original place of birth, and he will bring the gateway, a large mirror. The plan is to drink all the gin they have and then plant the mold in the hotel.\n\tThe hotel owner has read all the letters and wants to know if anyone can tell him how long a gleeb is, as several times in his letters, Glmpauszn refers to this length of time.\n",
            "The story begins with a hotel owner, Ivan Smernda, writing to the editor of a magazine about two strange guests at his hotel. Ivan has found only their suits, some letters, and the frame of a mirror left over after their stay. Ivan has forwarded these letters he has found to the editors of the magazine. These letters tell a story of two alien visitors to Ivan's world that intend to destroy all of humanity because the vibrations from Ivan's world sometimes cross over into their world. The alien visitors become addicted to alcohol and human feelings, but ultimately they succeed in developing a mold that will spread across humanity and kill everyone.",
            "This epistolary narrative begins with a letter to the editor of a paranormal-themed magazine. The letter's author, Ivan Smernda, owns a hotel called Plaza Ritz Arms, and recently two of his guests mysteriously vanished leaving behind several letters, a mirror frame without the mirror, and each of their suit of clothes, perfectly intact. The men are named Ed Smith and Joe Binkle, although Ivan guesses these are aliases. Ivan shares the men's letters with the editor in the hopes that they will be printed and serve as a warning for humanity. The first letter reveals Ed Smith's true name, which is Glmpauszn. Glmpauszn and Joe are Frequencies, ghost-like entities that exist in a spirit dimension adjacent to human reality. Due to the rise of humans using the services of mediums and fortune tellers to make contact with loved ones in the spirit world, the Frequencies feel terrorized. Glmpauszn has been sent to inhabit the human dimension, what he calls the \"not-world\", in order to find a way to destroy humanity and end its assault upon the vibrations of the Frequencies. Joe has already spent several \"gleebs\" (an unspecified amount of time) on Earth studying human ways in order to prepare Glmpauszn for his mission. They write to each other by possessing the minds and bodies of sleeping humans who can translate the language and write the letters. Glmpauszn details how he attuned himself to a human fetus and then sped up the growing process upon his birth, believing that the speed of his growth would impress his not-mother and not-father. Instead, he only frightens them both, and he runs away to a cave whereupon he accelerates his growth until he becomes an adult. As he begins to seek out a chemist to help him begin to plan the destruction of humanity, he runs into a woman who screams when she sees he is totally naked. Embarrassed, Glmpauszn lashes out at Joe, complaining that he has not prepared him sufficiently for his mission, and he must better learn human customs and emotions. He slowly adapts the forms and impressions of the human dimension. Not only does he love drinking hard liquor, but he also uses his invisibility power to rob a bank and fill his eighteen-room suite at the hotel with money. As Glmpauszn grows increasingly enamored with the human experience, he begins to neglect his mission, including reporting to his boss, Blgftury. Glmpauszn drinks excessively and starts to court women, seeking out the elusive feeling of love. One night he even attends a seance, and the medium summons Blgftury, who glares at him in anger. As Glmpauszn falls deeper into alcoholism, his neglect of the mission becomes so bad that he accidentally blows up his suite of rooms at the hotel. Eventually, he devises a kind of mold that can cause a fatal disease to spread throughout the planet. Mission accomplished, Glmpauszn suggests he and Joe rendezvous at Joe's hotel and return to their home dimension through the mirror gateway."

            "A Gleeb for Earth takes place on Earth, where the spiritual vibrations of human mediums and psychics are intruding upon and semi-terrorizing another world populated by sentient vibrational beings. The vibrational plane of the alien world extends just a tiny bit into Earth (referred to as the not-world by the aliens), and the fringe between the two allows for human psychics to intrude into the alien\u2019s realm, or for human seance practises to summon alien vibrations on Earth in ways that are terrifying for the aliens. The aliens can\u2019t tolerate these vibrational intrusions any longer and have embarked on a mission to destroy all life on Earth by having two of their own take the form of humans and develop a chemical weapon (a mold) to wipe them out.\nThe mission of Glmpauszn and Joe takes place on Earth between June 8th and September 25th of an unknown year. Glmpauszn mails letters from various international locations to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City by controlling the minds of unknown sleeping humans to pen what he spiritually dictates, and mail the letters without ever knowing they have done it. Glmpauszn\u2019s physical location is not explicitly discussed, but it is possibly nearby to New York City since he does not mention the need for any long-distance or international travel in his letters. Both Glmpauszn and Joe become distracted from their mission at times by drugs, alcohol, stealing money using their invisibility, and the sensations of experiencing human emotions like love.\nThe Plaza Ritz Arms hotel in New York City is an especially important location in the story, because it is the final meeting place where Glmpauszn and Joe return to their vibrational realm through a mirror with a heavy bronze frame, leaving their clothes in heaps as if they had melted out of them, only the frame of the mirror, and the pile of letters from Glmpauszn to Joe that detail their entire mission on Earth.\n",

Glmpauszn has traveled to many different areas of the world in his quest to find something to destroy humanity once and for all. ",
            "Glmpauszn and Joe come from a dimension that can be described as a kind of spirit world. The population of this dimension are referred to as Frequencies and are individual fluctuations within a larger vibration flux. They are able to enter the human dimension, which they refer to as \"not-world\", by attuning their vibrations to the human frequency because the dimensions are loosely joined together through the vibrational plane. They return to their dimension by using a \"gateway\" hidden in a normal-looking mirror. When Glmpauszn is sent to figure out a way to destroy humanity, he rents a suite of eighteen rooms at a hotel and fills it with stolen money as well as tubes, pipes, and other kinds of apparatus intended to be used to build a weapon of some kind. Joe lives at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City, which is where Ivan Smernda discovers his clothes as well as Glmpauszn\u2019s.

However, he is never physically in any of these locations. Instead, he possesses people sleeping in these cities to write the letters for him in order to avoid detection.

            "Glmpauszn is a sentient being from an alien world that takes the form of spiritual vibrations that are capable of controlling humans on Earth (which he refers to as the non-world), or entering the body of a human to take their form. He travels through a gateway (a vibrational point that alters the frequency of those who enter in the form of a mirror with a heavy bronze frame), allowing Glmpauszn to take on the frequency of a human and move his consciousness into a newborn baby. Once on Earth in newborn form, Glmpauszn quickly grows the body of the newborn baby into that of an adult man over a matter of days, and begins using the alias Ed Smith. He writes to Joe by vibrationaly controlling the minds of a variety of literate people around the world to pen the letters and then mail them to Joe at the Plaza Ritz Arms in New York City. The people he uses the mind of never become aware that they have written or mailed the letters.\nJoe (an alias name) is of the same world as Glmpauszn, and they are on a mission together to destroy all human life on Earth in order to stop the intrusive vibrations of Earth polluting their spiritually sentient world. There is a rocky start to their mission as Glmpauszn is not receiving any contact back from Joe who has become distracted by drugs and alcohol in his human form on Earth. Normally, Glmpauszn would be able to reach Joe through spiritual vibrations instead of letters, but Joe\u2019s vibrations are very weak due to the substances he takes. Joe eventually does write to Glmpauszn, but only to ask for money, which greatly offends Glmpauszn who becomes furious with him for abandoning their mission. However, their relationship changes as Glmpauszn begins to experiment with the feelings of being human, and tries to feel love and consume alcohol. Glmpauszn starts to relate to Joe\u2019s experience with alcohol, and they even decide to bring lots of gin to consume when they finally meet at the Plaza Ritz Arms to re-enter the gateway to their own world together after releasing the deadly mold that will kill all humans on Earth and complete their mission. They finish the mission triumphantly together, with Glmpauszn referring to them together in one of his final letters as conquerors and liberators for their world.\n",
            "The relationship between Glmpauszn and Joe is much like that of brothers. Joe is like an older brother who gives Glmpauszn advice, but when Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t like what Joe writes in his letters, he makes sure to send them on to Blgftury to \u201ctell on him.\u201d Glmpauszn relies on Joe\u2019s information, based on his experience in the human world. In his first letter to Joe, though, Glmpauszn blames him for not responding to his vibrations, forcing Glmpauszn to communicate with Joe by mail. By his second letter, however, Glmpauszn is more sympathetic to complications that Joe must have encountered due to humans, although he still doesn\u2019t understand why he hasn\u2019t received letters in response to his own. \n       Interestingly, Glmpauszn tells Joe all about what he is doing but is less forthcoming with Blgftury. Yet Glmpauszn blames Joe for being inefficient in providing the information he needs to succeed in his mission. Interestingly, at one point, Glmpauszn complains that Joe has asked for a loan of $5.00, which Glmpauszn refuses until later. Glmpauszn confesses that he is trying to learn to love money as humans do and has been amassing large amounts of it; he agrees to loan Joe the $5.00 he requested earlier but only by sending it through the person writing the letter for him.\n\tLike a big brother, Joe gives Glmpauszn advice. He specifically advises him not to drink alcohol. By the time Glmpauszn receives this letter, he is already heavily imbibing and learning the impact of hangovers. Glmpauszn confesses that he needs the alcohol to escape from the reality of human life. He also acknowledges that it is dulling his abilities, including the ability to become invisible. For their final encounter, which will be when Glmpauszn launches his attack on humanity, he wants Joe to bring as much gin as he can, and he will do the same. Together, after all the gin is gone, Glmpauszn and Joe will return to their world through the gateway of the mirror.\n\n",
            "Glmpauszn writes Joe as a companion on this quest to destroy humanity, but his written communications only go one way as far as the reader can tell. Joe never writes back, but can communicate with Glmpauszn via psychic ability, or \"vibrations.\" Glmpauszn quickly sours on Joe as he realizes that Joe has lost most of his alien abilities due to being addicted to alcohol and obsessed with money. However, Glmpauszn comes around on his fellow alien as he falls victim to alcoholism and \"money-love\" himself.",
            "Glmpauszn and Joe are both Frequencies who have attuned themselves to different humans in order to disguise themselves and gather information that will assist them in a plot to destroy humanity. Joe has spent a significant amount of time longer on Earth than Glmpauszn, and therefore he has had more time to adapt to human customs and emotions. Joe lives in New York at Plaza Ritz Arms, a hotel where the two eventually rendezvous in order to return to their home dimension when they accomplish their mission.  Glmpauszn sends Joe a number of letters describing his slow adjustment to human form. Although Joe's communications are never explicitly shared, his replies to Glmpauszn are minimal and often unrelated  to the letter to which he's responding. For example, Joe asks Glmpauszn for five dollars in response to a letter about Glmpauszn's rocky entry into the human dimension. This anger Glmpauszn, and he is further incensed when he receives a nonsensical, insulting communication later. However, after Glmpauszn discovers alcohol, he begins to relate to Joe, who has also succumbed to the struggles of alcoholism. Eventually, Glmpauszn develops a mold that can eliminate humanity, and they rendezvous at Joe's hotel to make their re-entrance to the vibrational plane via the mirror gateway."

            "Blgftury is an alien of the same world as Glmpauszn and Joe, which is being semi-terrorized by intrusive vibrations from Earth (which they refer to as non-world) that pollute their world\u2019s sentient frequency. Their world wishes to destroy all human life on Earth to become free from these intrusions. Blgftury is the boss of the other two, and Glmpauszn often refers to having to write reports for him begrudgingly to update on the status of the mission.\nBlgftury is not a supportive boss, because he wished to go on this mission himself. Glmpauszn describes that Blgftury gave him little praise, and even wrote thinly-veiled threats, in his response to Glmpauszn\u2019s report on how he escaped the pursuit of the police when he was caught naked in public after forgetting humans need to put on clothes. Blgftury has the authority to take corrective action related to the mission, evidenced by how Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t hesitate to forward him the letters from Joe that he finds offensive about asking for money and discussing \u201crevolting bodily processes.\u201d \nBlgftury has to pester Glmpauszn for reports when he begins to go off the plan and experiment with human feelings like falling in love and alcohol. Glmpauszn does finally successfully develop a mold that will kill all humans on Earth and sends detailed chemistry reports back to Blgftury on the subject. \nBlgftury spends a lot of time sending vibrations in the fringe area between Earth and their world, and by accident his vibrations are summoned by a spiritual medium into a white, shapeless cascade of light at a human seance gathering that Glmpauszn happens to be attending on Earth where he is fooling around with a red-headed woman in the corner of the room (flagrantly not doing the work of the mission) in full visibility to Blgftury. Blgftury responded with a pattern in his matrix that showed pain, anger, fear and amazement. Glmpauszn goes on to complete the mission and return with Joe to their home world without further interaction with Blgftury.\n",
            "Blgftury is the being who supervises Glmpauszn and whom Glmpauszn seems to dislike and want to impress at the same time. Glmpauszn thinks that Blgftury\u2019s criticism and threats are actually praise; he also thinks that Blgftury wanted to be the one to go on the expedition that Glmpauszn is on and is jealous that he didn\u2019t get to. At the same time, Glmpauszn wants to impress Blgftury. And when Glmpauszn has a complaint against Joe, he forwards it to Blgftury so that he is aware of what Joe is doing, most likely to make himself look better. Glmpauszn grows annoyed with Blgftury\u2019s requests for reports because he thinks he has other, more important things to do, such as exploring human emotions. To pacify Blgftury, Glmpauszn sends him reports about his experiments with chemistry that he plans to use to defeat humans, although he has not actually carried out these experiments. Glmpauszn doesn\u2019t have much respect for Blgftury and envisions an incident where Blgftury is present as an olive and is eaten by the blonde girl. \nAt a seance that Glmpauszn attends, the medium actually brings Blgftury across when she is trying to bring over a woman\u2019s grandmother. Blgftury looks angry and sees Glmpauszn, peering at him with an expression of pain, anger, fear, and amazement. At the end of the story, Glmpauszn has succeeded in his mission of creating a way to destroy the human race in the form of a mold. This mold will dissolve the brain and then cause the body to fall apart. Glmpauszn is pleased to have succeeded, and he dares Blgftury to make any criticism against what he has accomplished. \n",

Blgftury is concerned with the success of this mission and constantly badgers Glmpauszn for status reports. Blgftury appears briefly on Earth during a human seance, and this causes him great pain. Glmpauszn becomes quite annoyed with Blgftury, describing Blgftury's attempts to get updates about the mission as an annoyance. This is likely due to Glmpauszn becoming an alcoholic and being more interested in learning about human emotions like love instead of the mission at hand. ",

Blgftury had wanted to complete the mission himself, and he is rarely complimentary, so his communications with Glmpauszn are often curt. At first, Glmpauszn warns Joe he has forwarded his inappropriate, insulting letters to Blgftury. As time goes on, however, Glmpauszn reveals a growing distaste and impatience for Blgftury's grumpiness, criticisms, and bureaucratic oversight. At one point, he even expresses a desire for Blgftury to enter the human dimension in the vibrational pattern of an olive so that his blonde date could eat him. When Glmpauszn attends a s\u00e9ance conducted by Mrs. Somebody, he is horrified to see an angry Blgftury summoned instead of Grandma Lucy. "

            "Lois and Lorraine are having lunch at Judy\u2019s house, speaking about how Judy nearly spoiled their double-wedding where they both became sisters under the name Farringdon-Petts by solving a mystery.  \nJudy starts telling the story of the haunted fountain. She discovered a photo of a spectacular fountain in her grandmother\u2019s hot attic one summer as she was stuck there for two weeks while her parents went on vacation. She shed a tear onto the photo while recalling her sadness about not having friends or a sister, and imagined the fountain was a place for lonely girls to fill with their tears. Her grandmother overhears her speaking aloud her wishes and calls that she shouldn\u2019t keep her wishes to herself, because \u201cmost of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d\nJudy\u2019s grandparents take her to the fountain in the photo and it speaks to Judy, directing her to shed a tear into it and make wishes. Judy sheds a tear thinking about how her only friend just moved out of town and then hurries through her wishes before the ripples disappear - to have lots of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. All things that have come true in her life.\nAbruptly returning to Judy\u2019s modern timeline, she takes Lois and Lorraine to the attic. They are spooked by Judy\u2019s black cat, Blackberry, who makes sudden noises. Judy finds the photo and Lorraine recognizes the fountain is identical to one on her estate - yet it is in a different location. They surmise that it is in the woods on the edge of town that are part of the Brandt estate, and drive to it immediately.\nDuring their adventure, Judy recalls more of her fountain memory. Her grandparents didn\u2019t know the Brandt\u2019s well enough to pay them a visit, but instead stopped by the fountain on their way to drop off her grandmother\u2019s hooked rugs at the estate further up the path. Judy was left behind napping in a hammock - told by her grandparents they were getting her a surprise, but they didn\u2019t return. She followed a path to an old windowless tower, but got distracted by the sound of her grandfather's cart leaving. This is all she recalls, but there is evidently more to discover that will solve the mystery.\nThe trip to the fountain shakes the confidence of Lorraine in the back seat, who knows information about the new owners of the estate - Roger Banning - that she is withholding. Lois and Judy probe her about what she knows and why she ducked down to hide her face from a stranger passing in a car. Although Lorraine tells them about Roger, she does not reveal why she is afraid. Judy mentions knowing Roger\u2019s pal Dick Hartwell, who is apparently in the Federal Penitentiary for forgery now. As they park and exit the car to walk to the fountain, two dark-coated strangers approach them. This is where the story ends.\n",
            "Judy, a woman known for solving mysteries and chasing ghosts, had her friends Lois and Lorraine over for lunch in the haunted house she had inherited from her family. When Judy was growing up, her parents would spend summers on vacation without her, so she did a lot of reading at her Grandmother Smeed's house. These were sad summers for her, but she would soon start to solve mysteries and find her own adventures. She mentioned her tears falling on a magazine with a picture of a fountain; she imagined it was full of tears of many girls and pondered the idea of an enchanted fountain. Her grandparents took her to see a fountain the next day, where she heard a voice that told her to make a wish and to cry into the fountain--the same fountain that was in the picture in the magazine. Judy's friends got more excited about the story, and it continued: she had to think of a wise wish, but reacted too quickly to think carefully. Her wishes did come true; she wanted lots of friends, a sister, to solve mysteries, and to marry a G-man. All of these things came true, and the fountain kept Judy captivated. She patiently explained to her friends that she hadn't tried to learn the secret of the fountain, and it didn't speak to her after the initial encounter. Judy had lost her appetite for her dessert but wanted to retrieve the photo of the fountain to see if Lois recognized it; they all went to the attic, bringing Blackberry the cat with them. Lorraine recognized the photo of the fountain, but it seemed to make her nervous. Lois didn't want to leave yet even though Lorraine was clearly uncomfortable and wanted to go, and thought she might recognize the fountain from the Brandt estate, so Lois and Judy decide it's worth checking out to see if it's the same one. Lorraine only agreed to join after they promised not to drive all the way up to the house, and to walk the last part of the way. After a twenty-minute drive, Judy talked more about what she remembered about the day she visited the garden; she'd fallen asleep in a hammock, and woke up to an empty garden. She headed towards a tower but found her grandfather's car before she encountered anyone. Through all of this, Lorraine hints that she knows more than she's letting on, and doesn't think things will be as Judy expected. This is when Judy picks up on Lorraine's reticence. Judy and Lois want to explore the old tower and look for the fountain, when Lois admits she knows Roger Banning has been around the area. Lucy and Lois push Lorraine to say more about why she isn't talking, and they want to know why she doesn't want to be recognized. The story ends in suspense as two people in dark coats are walking towards the three women.",
            "Judy has invited her friends, Lois and Lorraine (who are sisters-in-law), to lunch at her home. She and her husband, Peter, live in a house she inherited from her grandmother. While Judy is out of the room, Lois asks Lorraine to tell Judy about something that is upsetting Lorraine, but Lorraine accuses Lois of always siding with Judy. On top of that, she claims that Judy almost ruined their double wedding. Judy enters at the end of the conversation, admitting that she has problems, too, and hasn\u2019t been able to solve all the mysteries she has attempted. When Judy mentions a promise she made not to discuss the dam and that she should have told Arthur, Lorraine has a pained expression and asks them not to talk about him.\nLois changes the subject, praising Judy\u2019s mystery-solving and ghost tracking abilities that she then explains sensibly; she asks Judy to tell them a story about one of her mysteries. Judy tells them about the haunted fountain that she saw when she was fifteen years old and spending part of the summer with her grandparents while her parents were on vacation. In the attic to look at some of her grandmother\u2019s old magazines, Judy began feeling sorry for being left behind and started crying. Her tear fell onto a picture of a fountain, and she pretended it was filled with the tears of lonely girls. Aloud, she comments that would make the fountain enchanted and starts to say a wish when her grandmother interrupts to tell her that if she let people know her wishes, most of them wouldn\u2019t be impossible to fulfill.\nThe next day, Judy\u2019s grandparents took her to a fountain that looked just like the one in the magazine. Judy walked into it and heard a voice telling her that if she sheds a tear in the fountain and makes a wish, her wish will come true. But the voice admonishes her to wish wisely. So Judy thought about how lonely she had been since her best friend had moved away and wished for lots of friends and a sister, to marry a G-man, and to solve lots of mysteries, all of which have come true.   \nJudy shows her friends magazine with the fountain, and Lois realizes it looks like the fountain on the nearby Brandt estate. On a whim, the three women decide to drive there to look at it. Although Lorraine is less than enthusiastic about the venture, she goes along but insists they not drive all the way to the house. After they turn into the long drive, a car approaches with a memorable-looking man at the wheel. As they near the path to the fountain, Judy recalls that her grandfather started to drive off without her, and she assumed he was teasing her. Lorraine admits she knows the Brandts no longer own the estate and has seen a classmate, Roger Banning, nearby. Suddenly, two dark-coated figures approach them.\n\n",
            "Judy is enjoying dessert with her two friends Lorraine and Lois as she recounts a tale from her childhood in which she came across a magical fountain that granted her all of her wishes. This fountain has given Judy her husband, friends, and renown as a paranormal mystery solver. As they are in the home in which she discovered a picture of the magical fountain, the three ladies decide to go into the attic to dig up that picture. Upon seeing the picture of the fountain, Lorraine and Lois seem to know its location. The three ladies head there but it seems that Lorraine is hiding some secret connection with the fountain, and there are people there that don't seem to want them around the fountain."

The house has an attic that is up a narrow set of stairs with a door at the top. They have a black cat named Blackberry that spooks her friends because it is creepy when it makes unexpected noises in the attic.\nWhen Judy is recalling the story of the fountain, the narrative bounces back and forth into their present reality as Lois and Lorraine ask questions.\nIn Judy\u2019s recalled story, she is a young red-haired girl with no friends who spends two weeks in the summer with her grandparents at their home. They have a hot attic filled with keepsakes and old reading materials, most notably a picture of a fountain that Judy\u2019s grandmother later brings her to. The fountain was centered in a deep, circular pool, and had steps leading up to it that were bordered with smaller fountains of lions with water spurting out of the mouths. Judy thinks it could be a beautiful location at any time of the year, surrounded by lush vegetation like rhododendrons and evergreens. From the fountain there was a path leading to a windowless old tower that was populated by cupids and gnomes that peered out at Judy.\nBack in modern day, when Judy, Lois and Lorraine go looking for the fountain, the tower is still visible, and Lorraine describes it as something out of \u201cGrimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.\u201d The friends visit it on a day where the trees are leafless in the woods, making the rhododendrons appear vibrantly green, under a gray sky.

Judy's friends consider the house haunted, but Judy insists that at least the attic is not. After the three leave the house to investigate where the fountain might be, they head into the woods where there is an uphill road leading to the Brandt estate. In this estate, there was an old water tower that was visible from the path the women were on, but the story ended before the women were able to confirm if the fountain was on this estate or not. ",
            "The story takes place around the early 20th century in a town called Farringdon in the USA as Judy\u2019s grandparents still drove a horse-led wagon, but Lois now drives a car, and Judy\u2019s husband is employed by the FBI. The story begins at Judy\u2019s house, which she inherited from her grandparents. While she is in the process of renovating the house, she still has her grandmother\u2019s things in the attic, including the magazine with the picture of the fountain. Lois alludes to the fact that Judy has tracked down the ghosts in the attic and cellar of the house. The attic is where Judy found the magazine with the picture of the fountain on it that she is telling her friends about. When Judy saw the picture, she had never seen a fountain in person, although there is a fountain at the nearby turreted Farringdon-Petts mansion. After Judy shows the picture of the fountain to Lois and Lorraine, the two women recognize it as the fountain on the Brandt estate.\n        The fountain is part of the setting in the flashback in the story. Judy remembers visiting the fountain during June; it was centered in a deep, circular pool with steps leading to the fountain. Smaller fountains in the shapes of lions were beside the steps, and water spurted from their mouths. After leaving the fountain, Judy found a hammock in a beautiful garden encircled by rose trellises. There were also rhododendrons and evergreens in the garden. After waking from her nap in the hammock, Judy saw an old windowless tower and a path leading to it. She followed the trail, and all along it were cupid and gnome figures that seemed to be looking out at her, tucked into surprising places. Just as she reached the tower, she heard her grandfather leaving with the wagon.  \n\tThe rest of the story occurs in the present\u2019s second setting, the Brandt estate.

Judy resented being left behind by her parents. However, during one summer with her grandparents, they took her to an enchanted fountain that Judy found a photo of in their attic. The fountain spoke to Judy and asked her to shed a tear into the fountain and make wishes. All of the things that Judy wished for in her life came true - to have a lot of friends, a sister, to marry a G-man and to solve a lot of mysteries. \nIn the telling of the story, Judy is older, married, and has a sister Lois (by way of Judy\u2019s marriage to her brother), and another close friend like a sister, Lorraine (by way of her marrying into the same family as Lois - the Farringdon-Petts). Judy shows modesty by bringing up the mysteries she never solved when Lois and Lorraine shower her with compliments. Judy\u2019s grandparents have since passed, but she lives in their home and keeps their belongings in the attic, showing her connection with family. \nJudy (maiden name Bolten) is married to Peter Dobbs, an FBI agent, and she prefers to discuss facts instead of gossiping about hear-say with Lois and Lorraine. Judy is diligent in asking questions about Lorraine\u2019s behavior when she ducks down in the car to hide her face from a passing stranger, and probes her to tell the truth about knowing who the new owner of the Brandt estate is - Roger Banning. Her wit is sharp, and she comes across as determined and willing to take risks to solve her mysteries (like passing no trespassing signs in broad daylight after they have already been spotted by a stranger).\n",
            "Judy is a woman known for her sharp detective abilities. She is married to Peter Dobbs, and took his last name when they married instead of keeping her maiden name, Bolton. She grew up rather lonely, not having many friends--the one friend she did have moved away. After she made a wish in an enchanted fountain, however, her life changed--she found friends, a sister, a dream husband, and a new ability to solve mysteries which brought her notoriety in the area. She is a very curious person who loves to read, which is why she was with the magazines in the attic at her grandmother's in the first place. She grew up interested in mystery books also, as evidenced by the books her father bought her, which likely led to her interest in solving mysteries of her own. ",
            "Judy Dobbs, n\u00e9e Bolton, is friends with Lois and Lorraine and their friend and her sister-in-law Honey. She is married to Peter Dobbs, an employee of the FBI. Growing up an only child, Judy had only one best friend and was very lonely when her friend moved away. She also never got to go on family vacations; her parents would leave her with her grandparents while they went to the beach hotel where they had spent their honeymoon. Judy is a forthright, somewhat self-centered woman. She is very curious and has a habit of pursuing mysterious occurrences to discover what is behind them. When the voice in the fountain urged her to make wise wishes, Judy wished for just the things that have happened in her life, but Judy points out that her wishes didn\u2019t come true until she started thinking of others. She also believes that as she goes through her grandmother\u2019s belongings, she might be able to solve some of the mysteries about her grandparents\u2019 lives. Judy is also analytical; she notices Lorraine\u2019s tendency toward jealousy and Lorraine\u2019s reaction to mentions of Arthur and suspects that Lorraine might be jealous about him. She also notices Lorraine\u2019s reaction to the oncoming car, hiding herself behind Lois, and her reluctance to tell them what she knows about the Brandt estate and confronts her, asking for her reasons.",
            "Judy is the main character of the story and she has become famous for solving paranormal mysteries. Judy's drive to see the fountain that brought her all her good fortune is what drives the story forward and gets the characters into trouble. Judy seems like a privileged character who is thankful for that privilege. She's highly inquisitive, never wanting to let a mystery go unsolved. She is a content character, but much of the story's beginning is dedicated to describing how she was before she became content as a lonely, depressed younger girl in need of friends."

Expressing her longing for friendship and a sister aloud sparks her grandmother to take her along to the fountain itself. When visiting the fountain, tears again become important because the fountain asks for a tear to be shed into it before wishes can be made.\nThe physical description of tears rolling onto a photograph or causing small ripples in the fountain that travel and dissipate are important visualizations that draw the reader into Judy\u2019s story, and make her character feel real. \n\n",

Her tears fell on a magazine that had a picture of a fountain, and she found it amusing that the fountain had tears as its source of water. She pretended that it was full of tears of many young girls, and her grandmother overheard her pondering this possible enchanted fountain, so they went to see a similar fountain the next day.

Her grandparents take her to see the fountain on the Brandt estate, and there, she hears the voice telling her if she sheds a tear in the fountain, her wishes will come true. As she watches the ripples in the water caused by her tear, Judy quickly comes up with several wishes that ultimately come true; even the wish for a sister that seemingly would be impossible to fill comes true when she gains a sister-in-law.

            "Alec Graham returns to his home from the office after a long day. His wife Molly has left, and he still feels that it looks wife-deserted even after doing many chores to clean it up. He recounts his bad day, having forgotten to set his alarm and rushing to the TV Studio that he writes for. The taxi driver refuses to take him to Madison and Fifty-fourth, and the rain has gotten worse. His hand continuously bleeds after passing by a big excavation site, and he misses his story conference. After hearing the same phrases numerous times and all six elevators being jammed, he is convinced that he is coincidence prone. Molly leaves him instructions on how to take care of himself, and he works on his novel. More of these events happen with pigeons colliding and somebody getting five straight-flushes in a row. Nat tells Alec about the strange occurrence as they get soda. The three bottles do not break after falling at least five feet, and Danny, the cop, is shocked. Outside, more strange events occur when Nat almost gets caught up with a swerving taxi. Once they return home, he immediately calls McGill, an assistant mathematics professor for some expert advice. Once McGill arrives, he says that all of the events are very improbable, which makes him inclined to believe that Alec is stringing him on or subject to delusion. They do an experiment involving coin-throwing, and all of the coins are arranged in a neat pile when Alec throws them. McGill asks him some more questions about any recent occurrences, but Alec suggests that they go outside to eat. Outside, the cars are being towed away, while two pedestrians are having trouble letting each other pass. Danny is confused by all that is happening. Alec also runs into Molly, stuck in a confused wrangle of umbrellas with two other women. She explains that somebody from their home had kept calling her mother\u2019s number, so she came back to investigate. Back at the apartment, all of this is traced back to Alec as the center. McGill tries to explain what is possibly happening to Alec, but they are interrupted by the telephone repairman. Molly suggests they go out to a restaurant to eat, and Nat comes along. They pass by the car jam again, and the police lieutenant looks at Alec with interest. Even at the restaurant, Alec realizes that his Tom Collins drink is made with salt instead of sugar. When the bartender tries to remake the drink for them, the shaker has frozen solid. It happens again with a new shaker, and the waiter is extremely confused. When Alec\u2019s hand collides with Molly\u2019s cigarette, it goes into the neighboring lady\u2019s vichyssoise. The two of them are displeased, and when Alec stands up, he ends up pulling all of the contents on their entire table onto the floor. The lady and the man are furious at Alec; even the owner has come to fix the situation. ",
            "Alec returns to his apartment after a day at the office, feeling worn out and defeated. He recalls the events from earlier that day; he had forgotten to set his alarm clock, making him late for a conference at the advertising studio he works at. He had forgotten an umbrella and found himself in the pouring rain, where he caught a taxi only for it to not start. The subways had suffered delays as well. On his walk to the office, Alec passed by a construction site, where he was nicked by a piece of glass from an explosion. He ended up missing his conference, and on his way home, a cop tells him that the elevators in his office building had all broken down as soon as he left. Alec reflects on these events, perplexed by the accident-prone coincidences. He decides to write at his typewriter when he drops his pencil, finding that it has landed standing on its end. As he continues to be stunned by the events, he fixes a drink for himself, taking note of the several notes that his wife, Molly, had left him while she visits her mother. Alec then witnesses a card game between his neighbor, Nat, and a group of men, in which Nat draws five straight flushes. Alec invites Nat in after the heated game, and after breaking a soda, they go to the corner store to buy more, where the bottles fall through the bottom of the bag. As the two walk back to their apartment, Nat is nearly bumped into and he steps onto the curb, causing a severe accident between multiple cars. Nat later leaves to his office to write an article about the strange events, and Alec calls up McGill, a mathematics professor and friend. McGill comes to Alec's apartment, and he is suspicious that he may be delusional or lying, due to the impossible probability of the events occurring. McGill then tosses some change onto the floor, testing to see if they all land on heads; instead, the coins stack up on top of each other. McGill is also confused, trying to imagine an explanation, and Alec suggests that some form of life is controlling the events. The two go out for food and pass by three women who have their umbrellas tangled up together. One of the women turns out to be Molly, who says she returned after her mother had been receiving constant calls from Alec's phone with no one on the other end. They go back to the apartment and discuss the matter, as the telephone repairman arrives. After, the three go to a restaurant, and face more inconveniences, such as having salt in their drink instead of sugar. Alec then accidentally drops a cigarette onto a neighboring party, and the woman gets angry, as Alec somehow pulls their tablecloth and dinner onto the floor, angering many. ",
            "The story begins with Alec missing his wife\u2019s presence as he feels lost without her aid in his life. He details how his commute to work was heavily hindered by unlucky transportation happenings and awful weather. When Alec leaves work and gets back to his apartment, he attempts to write a bit. In addition, he thinks over the strange coincidences that have happened during the day thus far. Upon hearing a loud commotion in his apartment building hallway, he goes to investigate. He finds his neighbor Nat in an argument with a group of men accusing Nat of cheating. In a fit of rage, one of the men hits the deck of cards that Nat is holding, causing them to be tossed to the floor. In another strange coincidence, half of the cards land face down but all the face-up cards are red. The group of men leave in confusion and Alec invites Nat into his apartment for a drink to cool down. \n\nAfter consuming most of the club soda, the two men leave to grab more club soda in a nearby deli. At the deli, another strange incident occurs. The 3 glasses of club soda fall through a thin plastic bag, 5 feet towards the ground and do not break when they should have broken due to the fall. The storekeeper is shocked but Alec shrugs off the weird incident. Nat and Alec return to his apartment where he notices more strange coincidences. Alec grows frustrated and decides to call his friend McGill to help him make sense of everything. McGill promptly comes over to Alec\u2019s apartment to help. McGill gets to the apartment and Alec tries to explain all of the coincidences. McGill is understandably very skeptical and wants Alec to prove it for his own eyes. \n\nAlec is able to prove that something strange his happening with a demonstration that involves throwing coins to the floor. The coins are thrown and somehow clustered together into a perfectly stacked pile. McGill then begins to believe Alec. He is uncertain about the probability of the coincidences but refuses to attribute it to superstitious happenings and states that it is an unknown force. When the two leave to go get food, they see and meet up with Molly on the street and quickly return to the apartment to catch Molly up on the strange occurrences. After much discussion over what could be causing the day\u2019s incidents, they decide to all go to get food. They order drinks at the restaurant, but mysteriously the shaker is causing the liquids to freeze. Molly notes how the restaurant is continuously becoming warmer, and later Alec mentally notes that he can no longer hear the sound of the air conditioner. While preparing to discuss the issue of the AC, Alec accidentally flips his cigarette onto another occupied table. This causes a heated argument with the other guests and the unapproving look from the owner of the restaurant towards Alec. \n",
            "Alec, the narrator, had a very weird and exhausting day. In the morning he overslept work and hurried out. A rain storm started the subway was delayed and there was a huge excavation on his way. The drill working with clay hit something glittering inside and a little explosion happened. The narrator's face was slightly scratched and bleeding. His absence at the conference wasn't noticed. Back home Alec saw his wife's nots with directions all around as she left to attend to her mother. Then he tried to write his novel and came to a dead end, so he poured himself a drink and watched some pigeons being trained outside, when some traffic occurred and a couple birds fell. There were loud voices outside: four men confronted the narrator's neighbor, a shy guy named Nat. Then the man came in for a drink, and told Alec that he had miraculously won in cards a couple times in a row, and his partners believed he had cheated. The narrator and Nat went out for sodas in glass bottles, which fell and miraculously did not break. On the street, a pedestrian, who suddenly stopped in front of Nat, caused a series of accidents leading to a huge traffic jam. Back at Alec's place, the curtain was weirdly tied in three knots and he called his knowledgeable friend McGill to get a consultation. The man came and considered all of the day's weird events very improbable but not impossible. McGill offered to make a demonstration, so Alec threw a handful of coins which bounced together, stacking into a neat pile. McGill's coins created an exactly straight line. McGill stated that Alec was the center of the weird events and there must be some design in that. They went out to eat and the cars were wrecking all along their way, overwhelming the cops. Two people were unable to go past each other, they fought making the same motions and saying identical words. Many similar situations were happening all around. One of the women with intertwined umbrellas was Molly, the wife. Her mother's number was constantly dialed with no one on the line, and Alec's number was always busy, so Molly got worried. At that point Danny, the local policeman, started suspecting Alec. The three went out for dinner eventually and took Nat with them, who wanted to hear the story. Alec dropped his cigarettes out of the pack under the suspicious gaze of Danny and a lieutenant. In the restaurant the whole company got salty drinks which puzzled the bartender. When he tried to do the new ones, nothing came out of the shaker - everything inside turned into ice. The place suddenly started getting warmer and quieter. Alec's hand collided with Molly's and her cigarette fell into the dish of a perturbed lady at the nearby table. While standing up, Alec accidentally pulled everything from that table to the floor and the angry lady slapped him. "

She is also a former nurse and loves Alec greatly to do all of this for him. Molly also has a habit of smoking, which she began doing when they went to the restaurant. When she notices something is wrong at home, she comes back immediately even though her previous plan was to visit her mother at Oyster Bay. Personality-wise, Molly is also a logical thinker. When Alec explains the situation to her, she also tries to find reasoning for it and catches on pretty quickly. Molly is very observant as well, watching the events that involve Alec play out. ",
            "Molly is Alec's wife, away in the first half of the story on a trip to her mother's. Molly is depicted as a caring and nurturing wife, shown particularly through the notes that she leaves Alec as he stays home alone. The notes, instructing Alec on housekeeping, also imply that Molly takes on a more dominant role in the household, knowing how to tend to a home and sustain the both of them. Molly is mainly concerned for Alec's well being regarding the unlucky events he is experiencing, asking if he feels alright and supporting him in searching for an explanation. ",

She cooks for him, organizes his schedule, cleans for him, etc. Alec seems lost without Molly\u2019s presence. It can be discerned that Molly has a caregiver type of relationship with Alec. She cares for him deeply and is easily concerned about his well-being. She boards a 2-hour train back to the train when she cannot reach him under unusual circumstances. ",
            "Molly is Alec's wife and a nurse. She treats Alec as her helpless patient, when she leaves, she places notes with directions for every simple action. So, she is even more attentive and thoughtful than she should be with a grown up man. She is very caring as she comes immediately as Alec's phone is busy. She is very anxious for him. She is clever and organized, she immediately evaluates the situation and shares her thoughts. She is friendly to everyone and they have very good relationship with Alec - he is very happy to see her and he missed her badly even during the ten days."

            "Alec is tired, upset, and confused about the strange coincidences relating to him. When he first goes home, he is extremely tired and compares his day to be the same as being beaten down. Judging from the events throughout his workday, he does not understand how they all relate to him and thinks of them as extremely weird coincidences. He even thinks of himself as being coincidence-prone. After the soda incident, however, he no longer finds it surprising after all that has happened to him. As the events build up, Alec slowly realizes that he is the center of it all, and he knows that he cannot get out of it. No matter how hard he tries, he directly interacts with or is nearby becomes strange coincidences. ",
            "As the strange coincidences occur in the story, Alec becomes increasingly frustrated. However, instead of driving him to the point of rage, the frustration drives him to exhaustion. At the beginning of the story, Alec already describes himself as feeling beaten down due to the morning's events. He feels more and more defeated as the day goes on, but also becomes more and more perplexed and fascinated. By the end of the story, Alec feels both helpless due to his uncontrollable bad luck and eager to find an explanation for this rare scenario, seeking other people for help and validation.",
            "For a large portion of the story, Alec is very casual about the strange coincidences that occur. He acknowledges them but does not fuss over them as much as those who also see them. When he is told that he just missed being stuck in his office building\u2019s elevators, he brushes it off as another coincidence. He does the same when his pencil lands on the floor standing on its end. Towards the end of the story, he grows more aware of the coincidences and becomes frustrated with them. The story ends with him getting into a heated argument at a restaurant when it is assumed that he purposefully flew his cigarette at an occupied table. ",
            "The first coincidences are just some bad luck as Alec thinks. When one oversleeps something important and is in a hurry, series of delaying events can happen as some bad luck. He is simply nervous about missing the conference, and tired of constant failures. It'[s also hard for him to live without his wife, his place looks wife-deserted which upsets him and this is the part of the reasons for his tardiness. When his absence isn't noticed, he returns home in a better mood and tries to write. Nothing helps though and Alec is stuck. Unnatural events start happening which distract him, at first, they simply surprise Alec. Later, they become more strong, often highly improbable - not breaking bottles, traffic, especially the three knots on the curtain. These ones look impossible to Alec and therefore scare him, so he calls McGill for a consultation. Further evidence convinces Alec in him being the center of a huge mess. He is confused and tries to hide his failures from the overseers."

            "Peter Karson has finished planning out the blueprint for the Citadel. He is excited to see it be built and go off into space to collect new information. Something suddenly snaps him out of his fantasy. Fifty stories above the window, there is a blood-red and subtly inhuman face staring back at him. The face slowly disappears, but he is stunned by the image. He then shakingly lights a cigarette and turns on the newsbox to see that an invader has appeared in Boston. More disasters are listed below, and the World Police announces that the Invaders have already begun terrorizing the world since they appeared twenty-four hours ago. Peter is doubtful that they can take down the Invaders and goes to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory. Lorelei does not know what is happening because Harry and she have been working for thirty-six hours straight. She does not have a newsbox, but he tells her to turn on her scanner to see the news. The panel shows the Science City of Manhattan, but the Invaders have come and snatched up men and women. Slowly, two Invaders make their way to the Atlas building, where Peter and Lorelei are. He goes into the inner room, even though she yells at him not to go. The Invaders have reduced Harry to nothing but a puddle of flesh, and Peter begins to ask why they are doing this desperately. They whisper to him in a strange language; he suddenly realizes that Lorelei has followed him. She drops to the floor after looking at the Invaders, which makes Peter scream. When he awakes again, a doctor named Arnold tells him to lie back down and that he is in a hospital. Although Dr. Arnold initially tells him that he has been in the hospital for three months, he eventually finds out that it has already been nine and a half months since he went into his coma. All of the survivors are underground because nobody knew how to kill the Invaders. Peter is considered their last hope because he is a scientist, and he thinks back to his plan of the Citadel. The ship is built, and it is called The Avenger instead. Lorelei tries to plead with Peter, but he refuses and says that it must be him who finds a superman that can destroy the Invaders. He goes into space until the ship curves into orbit. Peter kills many of the changeling children, but he allows one to live. The child is named Robert and is considered to be a super-intelligent being. Peter is hopeful that the changeling can kill the Invaders, but Robert says he will not return to Earth. He explains that they are like kin to him, and he logically has no reason to kill him. Peter is shocked and tries to plead with Robert, but the superman does not understand emotions. Robert does not feel good about the expression on Peter\u2019s face, and he hastens to an inevitable end. ",
            "Blood is dripping from a dead body in the room, Peter Karson. The story moves to the past, when young Peter finished the project of 'Citadel' - a spaceship to set off to an orbit. 'Citadel' was supposed to be a huge well-equipped laboratory, the first of its kind. While imagining the greatness of the creation, Peter felt dread and saw a face staring at him outside the window, fifty stories up. The face was scary and inhuman, the body hung without support for a while and then disappeared. Everything around was normal and Peter was worried he had gone mad. Then he saw the red headlines in the newspapers about appearing invaders and disappearing people. Cities worldwide were attacked and the World Police were mobilizing. The news proclaimed that the greatest enemy was to be faced and defeated. Peter rushed downstairs to Lorelei's laboratory, who had been working without breaks and hadn't seen the news. After Peter's agonized pleas, Lorelei turned on the news and saw a video of people becoming an unrecognizable joined mass, helpless and suffering. Then the two saw their own building in the news and halted. Peter went towards the inner room despite Lorelei's protests. He saw two aliens staring at Harry, Lorelei's assistant, and turning him into a boneless mess. Peter was so shocked that he screamed \"why?\" and heard some incomprehensible whisper in his head in response. Suddenly, Peter saw that Lorelei had followed him and her body dropped to the floor. Peter screamed inhumanely loudly and faded. He woke up in a hospital, the doctor said he had been very sick for three months and that Lorelei was fine. When Peter kept asking, he finally learned that he had been in a coma for more than nine months because of the rather long contact he had had with the invaders. Lorelei was simply shocked and recovered much faster. Arnold, the doctor, finally decided that Peter was strong enough to learn the truth and told about the part of humanity hiding underground as killing the aliens turned out to be impossible. Peter was needed as a scientist. His 'Citadel' project contained everything necessary to live a lifetime, it was a new independent world to save the rest of humanity. So, it was renamed 'The Avenger' and finished, as life underground was not a solution but a delay. Lorelei was in despair because of Peter boarding the ship and wanted to follow, but the rays were strong and even Peter had low chances of staying alive. When 'The Avenger' reached orbit, Peter felt the rays burning his flesh and smashed the mirrors to allow the embryos to mature. After a long time Peter told the story to Robert, the mutation-child with a superior brain who could destroy the invaders. Robert refused to go to Earth as his brain was logical and saw no reasons to destroy the Invaders. Peter didn't understand and the inevitable end approached. ",
            "The story opens with the character Peter Karson dead, as the narrator, identity unknown, contemplates their emptiness after killing him. The narrator says that they do not regret doing so, but they are unable to explain their emotions as they feel a tear rolling down their cheek. The story then goes back to a younger Peter as he finishes his project, the development of the Citadel spaceship. He suddenly hears a strange whisper within his brain, and he turns around to see a face with a shriveled body staring at him through the window. The creature slowly dissolves and disappears, and Peter is left stunned. He finds breaking news of invasions all over the world, murdering hundreds of civilians. The invaders, according to Secretary of the Council, are from outer space, and the World Police is attempting to destroy them. Peter rushes downstairs to find Lorelei, his lover, in the laboratory. She is unaware of the news, and upon seeing footage of the gruesome attacks, she is shocked, and they soon see the invaders approaching their building from the television. Peter steps into another room, seeing the two creatures with their focus on Harry Kanin, Lorelei's assistant. To Peter's horror, Harry quickly becomes a limp pile of flesh. Peter confronts the creatures but only hears foreign whispers, as Lorelei drops to the floor behind him. Peter lets out a scream, and wakes up in a hospital. The doctor tells him that he has been there in a coma for over nine months, and that Lorelei had recovered from shock. The doctor then tells Peter that society has moved to living underground in order to avoid the invaders; Peter, as a scientist, is their last hope. Later, Peter approaches the newly crafted spaceship, titled The Avenger, which lacks the typical shield to protect one from cosmic rays. Lorelei begs Peter not to go, but he believes it is necessary, and too much of a risk for Lorelei to join him. He boards the ship with the mission to create a \"superman\" to ultimately defeat the invaders; the plan is to allow the cosmic rays to mutate several embryos on board, hopefully creating a strong enough being. As The Avenger leaves and goes into orbit, Peter begins feeling the effects of the rays as his skin and hair mutates. As time passes, he allows the embryos to develop, destroying all but one. He raises the embryo as it develops into a person, and the story jumps many years later, as the child becomes a man named Robert. Peter had raised Robert, with a superior brain and logical ability, to be the defeater of the invaders. Informing Robert of the plan to return back to Earth, Robert surprisingly refuses. Peter is taken aback, and Robert explains that he is not able to comprehend the emotions that would lead him to kill the invaders and save Earthmen. Peter begs helplessly, and Robert ultimately feels it inevitable to kill him. ",
            "The story begins with a young Peter Karson, a scientist, working on a ship. He finishes his work for the moment and turns on the news to discover horrifying imagery and chaos being reported. He runs to Lorelei Cooper\u2019s laboratory to go share the disturbing news with her. Lorelei and Peter have a romantic relationship. He asks Lorelei to turn on the news and she is shocked by the imagery that is being detailed. Both Peter and Lorelei become stunned when they realize that the invaders to Earth are headed towards their building. They hold each other in stunned silence until they hear a scream from Lorelei\u2019s assistant, Harry Kanin. Peter goes out to investigate and discovers the Invaders turning Harry\u2019s body into nothing but flesh. Unbeknownst to Peter, Lorelei followed him and when the Invaders are done with Harry they begin to focus on her to Peter\u2019s terror.\n\nPeter then wakes up in a hospital bed. After much prodding, he is eventually informed that he has been in a coma for a little over nine months. He is told that humans are losing the fight against the Invaders and have retreated to living underground. He is soon informed that he must gain back his strength because as a scientist he is much needed in the fight against the Invaders.\n\nThe story then goes into detail about how Peter has been chosen to go to space on the Avenger ship and raise a viable embryo that has successfully mutated due to cosmic rays. The resulting person will then be used to fight against the Invaders. He does this while orbiting space on the ship. He destroys the inappropriate creations and keeps one embryo that sees as potential. That would grow up to be Robert. Many years have passed as he raises Robert. Eventually, he tells Robert the story of how he was created and details the mission that he is meant to carry out. Robert has great brain prowess due to his mutations and Peter is hopeful that he will be able to successfully fight against the invaders.\n\nHowever, Robert soon informs Peter that he will not go through with the plan. He reasons that he does not experience emotion and has no reason to care for the humans on Earth. Peter is greatly upset as he realizes his life\u2019s work failed and Earth will not be able to save. \n"

It was supposed to be a huge metal laboratory-spaceship. The ship was to have many levels of laboratories and storerooms, the meteor deflectors, the air renewal system and the mighty engines. Suddenly, Peter felt some kind of dread around, he looked out from the window of his office and saw a horrible creature fifty stories up. Then he took the newspapers from his newsboy and saw the headlines about the invaders. He rushed two floors down through the staircase to the radioactive laboratory, where Lorelei, his girlfriend, was working. She was in the forest corner with a huge ledger. The two went to the scanner to watch the news and suddenly saw their own building, a tall, pure white structure. The silence was oppressive. Peter moved towards the inner room and confronted the aliens. Then he woke up in a sort of hospital after a long coma, he couldn't understand where he was and for how long. All the major cities were destroyed. People were digging to hide underground, but it was a delay rather than a solution. A new ship 'The Avenger' was built following the model of 'Citadel'. 'The Avenger' wasn't that big as 'Citadel' was supposed to be, it was a steel globe with compressed oxygen and concentrated food enough for a lifetime. Peter boarded the ship and sealed the door, then he sank down on the floor, knowing his low chances of staying alive. He closed the inner door and walked to the control room. He turned the keys and was pressed into the chair. He passed the moon and Mars and reached orbit. He felt the rays burning him there and broke the windows. For years he watched the embryos grow until Robert, the needed mutation, appeared. Peter fed him with knowledge for years. Earth was a tiny blue star far away, where many more years passed. When Robert refused to save the Earth, everything came to an end. ",

The building contains both Peter's office, where he works on the Citadel, and Lorelei's laboratory, located two stories below. The laboratory contains several rooms, scattered with machinery and papers, with a video panel on the wall. After Peter's encounter with the invaders, he wakes up in a hospital, and he is then taken to the relocated city underground. The final part of the story takes place aboard The Avenger, a ship like others, except supplied with sufficient food and without cosmic ray shields. ",

After the Invaders attack their building and seemingly kill Lorelei, Peter wakes up in a hospital room. He is able to leave and meet up with Lorelei \u2013 who is actually alive- in an underground city once he recovers. Peter then goes on a mission to orbit space on the Avenger ship in hopes of finding an embryo that has mutated in a manner that could help save Earth.

Instead, it is filled with compressed oxygen and concentrated food to last a lifetime. There is also a control room, engine room, airlock, and inner lock. The Avenger ship is essential because it is the key to finding a superman who can save human civilization. Since the Invaders have caused the remaining population to burrow underground, this ship carries all hopes for the future.

However, the goal of The Avenger is to create a superhuman that can return to Earth and defeat the invaders. The ship will do so through mutation via cosmic rays, which are purposely allowed to beam through the ship. Aboard The Avenger are multiple embryos, all which will undergo different mutations, and Peter is responsible for monitoring their development and ultimately finding one fit enough to destroy the invaders on Earth.",

The goal is to produce a person that has advantages over a normal human being. The thinking is that this new human would be able to successfully fight against the Invaders and save Earth. "

            "Robert is the one changeling child that Peter did not destroy. He is described to have an eager brain, and Peter keeps feeding knowledge to it. Robert also has a superior brain, capable of instinctively solving problems that would take mechanical computers hours of work. Physically, Robert also has talons. However, despite being a successful superman, Robert does not understand anything emotional. He refuses to go back to Earth to destroy the Invaders, citing that he is a being of logic. Robert says that he will use the people on Earth for his own gain, which the Invaders are already doing. Therefore, he finds it illogical when Peter asks him to kill the Invaders and not his people. Even when Peter says that he is his friend, Robert says he does not understand and believes that gratitude is a reciprocal arrangement. ",
            "Robert was raised on 'The Avenger'. He was one of many embryos brought by the ship into space to be raised under the strong rays. Such an upbringing causes mutations, and people planned to create a mutant similar to the Invaders - a superior logical brain, who can understand and conquer the Invaders. This was the only hope for the humanity to be saved as they couldn't defeat the Aliens with their own forces. Robert is that one right mutation, a superman. There was a flaw in the calculations though, as a coldly logical being Robert has no reasons for destroying the Aliens. He doesn't have feeling, so he doesn't have compassion towards the humans to help them. Moreover, as the Invaders are easy for him to understand, he is rather on their side. He cares for Peter as much as he can, but his gratitude can't overcome his lack of desire to do something. After Peter's death, he can't feel emotions either but he feels some emptiness inside, which shows he has developed some warmth towards Peter. This emptiness has no reasons and no solutions, which puzzles Robert for the first time in his life. ",
            "Robert is the final embryo that Peter allows to develop on The Avenger. He has spent his entire life on the ship with Peter, and has absorbed knowledge through him for years. Consequently, and in tandem with the cosmic ray mutations, Robert's brain is superior and advanced, with the ability to solve any problem and think with perfect logic. Because of his advanced knowledge, Robert is unable to feel emotions, including love, hate, and fear. This leads Robert to not understand the mission that Peter has set out for him, and he refuses despite his intelligence.",
            "Robert is the embryo that Peter selected to raise on the Avenger ship. He was deemed as having the best likelihood of successfully fighting against the Invaders due to his mutations. Unfortunately, he does not agree to complete the mission he was destined to complete. Peter describes him.  as being a superman as he is able to solve complex problems faster than even computers. Physically he is described as having talons. Mentally, he is coldly logical. He does experience emotions the same way as humans and does show loyalty to the human race. He does not understand nor like Peter\u2019s reaction to the news that he will not be carrying out the mission to save Earth. "

            "The House of Masur is a family business in Zur, run by Koltan and his six sons. The business specializes in pottery and clay manufacturing for Zur. The family gathers as they deliberate the upcoming arrival of Earthmen. Some of the brothers express frustration that the Earthmen will be landing among the Thorabians rather than in Zur, disrupting their plan to steal the precious, scarce metals off their ship. Zotul, the youngest of the brothers, discourages the plan, saying that the Earthmen's ship is their only way of transport. After the meeting, Zotul ponders what other benefits the Earthmen could serve. The Earthmen eventually arrive at Zur, parading the streets and making speeches, and leaving shortly after. They return with multiple ships and establish corporations all over Zur. One day, Zotul's wife brings home a metal pot, which she had bought from Earthmen; she tells him that they are high in demand and that a new type of stove is essential to use them. Zotul protests, but later designs a ceramic stove, which becomes a successful development in their business. Earthmen continue introducing more technology to Zur, including a printing press and telegraphs. Zotul notes internally that though the business has made profit, it is dependent upon the pots from Earth. The business quickly begins declining, with sales dropping. They attempt to advertise their business, but advertisement has become fully occupied by Earth. After ten years, during which Koltan has passed on, the Masur business has dwindled. The brothers decide to go to the governor of Lor, who tells them that the developments are all beneficial, informing them of a new production of highways. The brothers are optimistic that they would be able to use their clay for the roads, but Earthmen begin using cement. The governor then refers the brothers to Earth's Merchandising Council, where Zotul meets Kent Broderick, where he expresses sympathy about the status of the Masur business and offers them the luxuries brought by Earthmen, completely free except for the cost of freight. The cost, however, is more than the brothers could ever afford, and so Broderick sets them up with a credit system, as well as a contract for the family to supply Earthmen with ceramic parts. The brothers enjoy their luxury, but it is short lived, as their contract expires and they find themselves in debt. Zotul then revisits the governor, who ends up being Broderick. Broderick informs Zotul that Earth has bought them, and every business in Zur, out, and that they own everything. Broderick tells Zotul that the family will work for Earth now, and that Earth will fully conquer Zur. ",
            "The story is about a group of people on a planet called Zur. One day, they are visited by Earthmen who arrive in a ship made of valuable material. The Earthmen come with announcements that they only intend to provide the world of Zur with great things and that all will be well if the Zurian people cooperate. Soon, more Earthmen arrive on the planet. They land a ship in every city on Zur and begin trading basic items. When they trade, they take the Zurian version of their goods and destroy them. Zotul is forced to design new stoves for the new cookware. Zotul and his brothers are initially able to make a great profit selling their new ceramic stoves. \n\nThe Earthmen continue to bring new inventions that the Zurian population do not possess. They bring new communication devices like the printing press, then radios, and eventually television sets. Eventually, Zotul and his brother\u2019s operations are unable to compete with the Earthmen\u2019s goods. Their profits drop to abysmal levels in all of their industries. Zotul is told by his brothers to go make a formal complaint. He goes to the headquarters of the Merchandising Council where he meets Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council. Broderick acts very nice to Zotul and appears to only have good intentions. Broderick promises to help Zotul and offers to give him many luxurious gifts that Zotul states he cannot afford. Broderick explains to Zotul that is of no issue and he can offer him credit. After only explaining the good parts of credit to Zotul, Zotul goes and convinces his brothers to sign up for the credit system. In addition, Broderick gives them a contract to manufacture some goods for the Earthmen. However, the contract does not last long and the Earthmen build their own plant. As a result, the House of Masur is unable to keep up with its debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers express their anger and accuse Zotul of getting them into incredible poverty. In an effort to remedy the situation, Zotul goes to the Council House where he does not find Mr. Broderick but a man named Mr. Siwicki. Mr. Siwicki informs him that the Earthmen will repossess everything him and his brothers own if they do not pay their debts. Zotul\u2019s brothers are so stunned by the news that they do not even beat him. In a last-ditch effort, Zotul goes to the governor\u2019s palace for help. There he finds Broderick is now the governor. Broderick then informs Zotul that the Earthmen were slowly taking ownership of Zur away from the Zurian to then move in an attempt to peacefully take over the planet. The ultimate goal is to mix with the native population and then form a cohesive one. However, the Zurian caste system had to be first broken down. The story ends with Broderick asking if Zotul and his brothers are ready to willfully oblige to their assignments and Zotul replies yes. \n",
            "\nKoltan of the House of Masur is furious that the Earthmen are coming to live amongst the Thorabians in the world of Zur while his brother, Zotul, is in favor of it. Kalrab Masur says that there is nothing to worry about because the Earthmen will eventually leave, but clay will go on forever. Morvan thinks that the Earthmen could have come to Lor, and Singula implies that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen. Zotul tries to explain that they cannot take the Earthmen\u2019s method of transport away from them, but the other brothers tell him to be quiet. The Earthmen arrive at Lor and are impressed with the city, and they communicate through interpreters. Some agreements between the Lorian government and the Earthmen are made. Although the anti-Earthmen Faction is happy that the Earthmen are gone, the visitors come back and establish corporations to engage in trade. When Zotul comes home, his wife Lania shows him an aluminum pot. She tells him that the Earthmen are selling these items cheap. She tells him that he will need to design a new ceramic stove for a dozen pots. He beats his wife but goes off to design the stove anyways; the Masurs begin to profit more than ever from the porcelain stoves. The Earthmen also bring other items such as the printing press, copper wire for telegraph lines, and plastic cutlery. The Masur family ceramics are slowly being replaced. Kalrab concludes that the items from Earth are the main reason.  The Earthmen begin to lay pipelines after the discovery of crude oil and natural gas. The Masur stove business is also gone after ten years; the brothers plan to protest to the governor of Lor. They see the Earthmen are building more structures, such as an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The brothers want to rely on their tile business, but the Earthmen have begun manufacturing Portland cement. The governor is in support of the Earthmen, and they go to speak to Kent Broderick, who is in charge of the Merchandising Council. Broderick tells him that he will give the expensive Earth items to Zotul for the payment of freight charges on items. Broderick offers credit to him and his brothers as part of the Easy Payment Plan. All of the brothers sign. The brothers slowly go into debt, and the Earthmen build plants that cost lower to manufacture materials. They tell Zotul to speak with Broderick again, but Mr. Siwicki speaks to him instead and says that the brothers will need to assign the remaining three-quarters of their pottery. Koltan tells Zotul to see the governor, but the person is revealed to be Broderick. He says that they have taken over everything on Zur because Earth is too overcrowded. The future population will be a mixture of Zurians and Earthmen; he tells Zotul that he will have his job back but work for the Earthmen. Broderick then hands assignment papers for him and his brothers to sign. ",
            "The House of Masur owns a prosperous family business of pottery and consists of six brothers, each having their position in business according to their rank of age. The Earthmen come to the world of Zur, which enrages some members of the family. The younger brother, Zotul, is sympathetic to the Eartmen, but the youngest can\u2019t speak up and he gets beaten. The Earthmen parade through Zur, proclaiming the intention to do great things and asking for cooperation. After a while, many more ships come from Earth to every Zurian city to establish \"corporations\" for trade. Zotul's wife buys a set of cheap aluminum pots at the market, which are being bought by all the housewives as they are better than those from clay. New pots require completely different stoves and Zotul has to design such. Koltan, the elder brother, puts the model into production as the demand is high. The Masurs flourish with the new business and depend on the metal pots from Earth, as the production of their own falls. The Earthmen keep introducing new things like telegraph lines and printing presses. The Earthmen find a great deal of metals, crude oil and natural gas, and sell it to the Zurians themselves. Further introduction of plastic utensils undermines the Masur's business completely. They head to the governor, who talks about the benefits of new culture and upcoming autos and highways. The Earthmen introduce cement and the hopes for tile business go down as well. The complaints are redirected to the Merchandising Council set by the Earthmen, where Zotul is met by Broderick. The man is sympathetic to the brothers\u2019 poverty, but he can only grant Zotul a gas range, a gas-fired furnace and a car, a luxury only a few can afford and everyone envies. The goal of the Earthmen is to spread technology through the galaxy, so Broderick only asks Zotul to pay for the freight, which is a huge sum, and, therefore, can only be in credit for the family. Enchanted Zotul takes the credit papers for all his brothers to sign to get the same goods. Broderick also gives a contract for making ceramic parts for the cars, which will help the brothers pay off the credit. After signing the papers, the brothers enjoy the luxuries and receive one fourth of the ceramic profits. In three years the Earthmen cancel the contract, the family is poor and Zotul is forced to visit the council again as the Masurs can't pay. A new man threatens him with the court and asks to assign the rest of the business to the Earthmen. Zotul heads to the governor for support, but finds Broderick on his place, who tells the Masur's business is the last to be bought off. Earth is overcrowded, so the new planets are required to take over. Instead of painful wars, the Earthmen buy off other nations to work for them until both nations are equal and mixed. "

Otherwise, he is beaten badly, which scares him. He is also given all the orders and is used as a negotiator. He does all the time-consuming tasks like to complain. "

He is very cordial and enthusiastic when he meets Zotul who has come to complain about the lost profits his family has experienced. Broderick communicates to Zotul that he sincerely wants to help him and Zotul would have brought the issue to his attention sooner. He gives Zotul and his brother contracts stating they the Earthmen will use their facility for some of their manufacturing purposes. This works out really well for the House of Masur until the Earthmen eventually build their own facility and manufacture the same product but in a cheaper manner, undercutting all profits the House of Masur could make. Even further, Broderick gets Zotul and his brothers to voluntarily go into debt so that they could own the luxurious items that the Earthmen were bringing to Zur. Eventually, Broderick becomes governor of Zur. When Zotul visits the governor\u2019s palace and he sees Broderick, Broderick explains to him the purpose of the Earthmen\u2019s actions. ",

He is able to successfully manipulate Zotul into falling for the scheme. Later, it is revealed that Broderick has become the new governor. He tells Zotul that everything belongs to the Earthmen now and the future Zurians will intermarry with the people from Earth. He also convinces Zotul that everything will go back to normal again, except they will be working for Earth. \n",

He is a great seller and he convinces Zotul very soon to take the credit. When Zotul comes a couple years later, Broderick can do nothing to help and pretends to be sympathetic and sorry again. In the end, he becomes the governor of Lor. He is happy to explain the plan to Zotul and appears sincere in the end. Broderick directly tells that all those actions were parts of a plan to own Zur. Then he patiently explains the reasons against war and the future plan. Mentioning the war makes him look painful from some experience. In the end, he is smiling again and cheers up Zotul as the plan is huge but good."

            "John Kevin catches up with Doc, who has grabbed a human by the throat. He tells the human that man will reach the moon tonight, and the man agrees, so Doc will let him go. Kevin apologizes to the human and says that his father has trouble differentiating old events. They see Martian tourists approaching the corner, and Kevin recalls how he hates Martian tourists because they are aliens. The two go to a flophouse, where Kevin bargains with the clerk over the price of a room. He threatens the human but stops when he hears Doc mumbling. They go to the room, and he lays Doc out on the cot. Doc begins to mumble more, while Kevin begins to copy down the words in his notebook again. Kevin knows that what Doc is mumbling will make him the most powerful man in the Solar Federation, especially because Doc was once somebody extremely important. Doc then begins to cry, and Kevin decides to comfort him slightly. Kevin then meets a woman by the bus stop and asks her for a dime for coffee. He realizes that she is a human tourist and recalls how he hates tourists. She offers to buy him dinner too, and they go to get a coffee. Kevin is revealed to be a caffeine addict, and he tells the woman that he wants a hamburger. One hamburger becomes several, and he drinks a glass of milk. Kevin asks the woman for a few to take home, and she introduces herself as Miss Vivian Casey. Kevin tells her his name too, and she hands him a coupon from a magazine. When he comes back to his senses, the counterman is pulling a five-dollar bill from under his hand. When he goes back, Doc has made something. It is revealed that Kevin has been trying to get time travel from Doc for the past few months and sees a condemned snowbird. The two thin and heavy men talk to him, asking him to tell them where he came from. The doctor explains his condition and hands him a manuscript, and Kevin steps into the range of Miss Casey\u2019s gun in real life. He asks her for coffee again, and she re-introduces herself as a North American Mounted Police member. She explains that Doc wanted to profit off of his time travel, but he did not have money. He wrestles the gun from her; suddenly, a Martian by the name of Andre appears. Andre makes Kevin realize that he is not a Centurian humanoid because he is the son of Doc. Kevin destroys the thing that Doc creates because he knows nobody is ready for time travel to be rediscovered. Miss Casey and Andre are relieved, while Kevin ponders why he destroyed the machine. He thinks it may be because of emotions or roast coffee. ",
            "The story is set in the world of intergalactic life and tells us about Kevin, a poor Centurian humanoid, and Doc, a person whose real name and significance Kevin forgot, but still remembers him as someone somewhat important to him in the past and roams with him around North America. Kevin pulls Doc away from an unfamiliar man whose collar he grabbed and carefully walks him to a flophouse. He pays for the room after a small conflict with the clerk. Once inside, Kevin falls down from muscle pain and Doc starts mumbling something that Kevin subconsciously remembers to be of utter importance. After writing down everything he heard from the old man, Kevin leaves in a search for coffee. A woman on the street agrees to pay for his drink and food despite Kevin\u2019s impoverished appearance -  we learn that he has a caffeine addiction that presents in a way more profound and serious way in Centurian men than in earthmen. She introduces herself as Vivian Casey and asks for a favor in return, handing him what seems to be a magazine coupon with some strange content. Suddenly Kevin becomes disoriented, Vivian disappears, leaving the money for the food in his fist. He pays for the bill, ordering some more to take with him, and comes back to Doc who has managed to create some strangely looking device from a bulb, a pen, and the bed carcass while Kevin was away. After kneeling beside Doc while the old man is murmuring something Kevin soon realizes that he is in a Victorian living room. He finally remembers that time travel was the reason why he considered Doc important. He meets two men that seem to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson. They briefly talk about time travel and after the doctor gives him his manuscript  Kevin finally goes back to his time only to find Miss Casey\u2019s gun pointed at him. She turns out to be a constable and tells Kevin that Doc found a way to travel in time and decided to make money by getting rare books in the past, but apparently started bringing works that had never existed. Kevin throws coffee at Casey, disarming her, but instantly sees a Martian at his door. Andre, as he introduced himself, continues the story Casey started and claims that hundreds of people disappeared after receiving Doc\u2019s books, but what\u2019s even more important, these books, which never existed, can help humans reach a state of pure logic. During their conversation, Andre also helps Kevin remember that Doc is his father and Kevin himself is actually an earthman not a Centurian. Overwhelmed, Kevin quickly decides to break the time travel device and, thus, lose this knowledge for many years because he\u2019s certain that neither Martians nor earthmen are truly ready for time travel.",
            "The story introduces an initially unnamed protagonist, who accompanies a fellow named \u201cDoc\u201d, both of whom are men but not Earthmen, hence Centurians. Doc is first introduced as choking a human man, seemingly in a trance and talking about a man reaching the moon. The protagonist carefully removes the human from Doc\u2019s hold and asks for forgiveness, claiming memory issues, and the pair move on to a cheap motel. While arguing for the cost of their stay, the clerk finds out that the protagonist had cheapened him despite having a quarter, and keeps the remaining nickel. \n\nThere, the protagonist lays Doc on the bed in the dirty room and as he begins to mumble, the protagonist begins to take notes amidst his own cramps and feelings of dirtiness. He soon remembers that the Doc holds the information to become a powerful man. However, his own pain wins out and the protagonist stumbles out of the room and encounters a clean, young woman, hoping to beg for a cup of coffee and she does, but only as she accompanies him in drinking coffee and eating several hamburgers. Introducing herself as Miss Vivian Casey and himself as John Kevin - the protagonist finally realizing his name - Casey presents Kevin with a coupon clipping from a magazine detailing a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. As he reads it however, Kevin finds himself disoriented and the young woman gone. Kevin heads back to the room and finds that Doc has created an unnamed thing, which he finds trouble understanding its meaning. \n\nKevin suddenly finds himself in a Victorian living room with a man he labels as a snowbird, the latter who probes Kevin to reveal what time and place he has come from. Surprised, Kevin realizes that the information he was trying to get from Doc was time travel, and this Victorian snowbird had come to this conclusion as well. Through a length of discourse, Kevin describes what he knows about various Earth theories like yoga and relativity. Afterwards, he asks the doctor a question about his first manuscript and accepts the papers before finding himself back in the original timeline of this story, looking straight into Casey\u2019s gun. \n\nMiss Casey turns out to be a policewoman, who after being handed the manuscript papers, reveals to Kevin that Doc has indeed figured out a method for time travel by obtaining rare editions of literature and books that did not exist for his clients. Aided by a Martian named Andre, it is revealed that hundreds of people have disappeared after receiving a book from the Doc and that Kevin was actually Doc\u2019s son - and human. A dispute soon occurs between the three ending with Kevin destroying the time machine, hoping that the future rediscovery of time travel will be accompanied by the world\u2019s readiness for it. In his ending thoughts - Kevin debates why he did that - for the human race\u2019s purpose, or for the production of coffee. \n",
            "When John Kevin caught up with Doc, a man was grabbing the collar of Doc. He took Doc from the man and walked him to a flophouse. When he got them a room to stay in, he tried to save some money from the only quarter. He needed that money to get something caffeinated after taking care of Doc. However, he failed, and the clerk took the money in the flophouse. After he recorded some notes for Doc\u2019s mumbling, he went out to get food. He begged for a woman on the street for money, but the woman would only buy him food after watching him eat. He gulped some hamburgers and coffee when the woman watched him eat, bought some food after the women had left, and left for the flophouse to feed the Doc. John Kevin has trouble finding the memory of himself because of the side effects of time travel. He mistook himself as Kevin O\u2019Malley, which is Doc\u2019s name. He also mistakenly considered himself a Centurian, who regarded drinking coffee as a vice, when he was an Earthman. When the woman asked for his name, he introduced himself as Kevin because he thought Kevin O\u2019Malley was his name. When John Kevin went back to the room, he saw Doc had made a thing by using the materials in the room.\n\nHe time-traveled to the Victorian era, where he saw two men sitting on chairs and chatting. During his stay in that era, he realized what he had been trying to know from Doc was time travel. He also realized that the man he talked to within the room, who he mistook as a snowbird, is Doc. After talking to the men, he received the first manuscript from them and returned to his own time, where he reencountered the woman, whose gun pointed at him. She revealed herself as a constable from the police, trying to tell Kevin the truth. But he rivaled against her. Then a Martian came, trying to do the same thing as the woman. From their saying, John Kevin realized his true identity as Doc\u2019s son and knew the consequences of Doc\u2019s use of time travel. Once he understood the situation, he destroyed the time machine because he didn\u2019t want to live in a pure logical state, which is the outcome of using time travel to make fantasy reality.\n"

She has an appealing mouth; Kevin also notes that her body is lean, athletic, and feminine. She also wears a powder-blue dress that goes down to the lower-half of her legs. She speaks in an educated voice and is kind enough to take Kevin to get some food. Although he is annoyed she decided to tag along, she lets him order multiple hamburgers to satisfy his hunger. When she introduces herself, he assumes that she is a schoolteacher. Kevin later realizes that she did not pay for his dinner at all. Miss Casey then comes back with a tiny gun. She is shown to be proficient with the firearm, introducing her true identity as a Constable of the North American Mounted Police. She is also very intelligent, being fully aware of what Doc has tried to do in the past. Although she uses force to judo hold Kevin, she doesn\u2019t put her heart into it. Finally, she is shown to be proud of Kevin when he does the right thing and destroys the time machine. ",
            "Vivian Casey is a decently looking woman who agrees to pay for the drink and food of Kevin, a poor Centurian man who has been wandering around North America with Doc, someone who Kevin believes to be important to him. After Kevin uses the time travel device, that Doc has made while Kevin was away, and finally comes back from the Victorian era, Vivian waits for him with a gun and introduces herself as a constable of North American mounted Police. Apparently, she has been following Kevin and Doc, his father who found a method of time travel,  for a while and even got closer to him by pretending to be an innocent bystander when he was hungry and suffering withdrawal effects in the beginning of the story. When Kevin destroys the device she cries and admits that she\u2019s glad he did that. Vivian seems to be a good constable who can understand people well, but she\u2019s also sincere enough to accept her view on things. ",
            "Vivian Casey is first introduced to us as a clean young woman waiting at a bus stop, assumed by Kevin to be a schoolteacher and a tourist. She is approached by Kevin as he begs for a small amount of change to use to buy coffee. His request will only be fulfilled if she accompanies him, so Kevin reluctantly follows her as she buys him coffee and hamburgers. She is heavily emphasized as being clean and introduces herself to Kevin as Miss Vivian Casey with a bright smile. After providing him with food and drink, Casey requests a small favor from Kevin and presents him with a coupon clipping from a magazine that details a request for \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. \n\nWe see Miss Casey again as the protagonist reappears in front of her tiny gun, where it is revealed that she is not a schoolteacher nor a tourist but rather a North American Mounted Police. Her interaction with Kevin was intentional, as she had been tracking him and the Doc in order to stop the latter\u2019s method of time travel. She plays a key role in helping Kevin unravel the truth about his identity and what the Doc was doing. In the scuffle to keep the time machine out of the hands of the Martians, she grabs Kevin in a judo hold which he quickly breaks and then  destroys the machine. She is seen at the end of the story crying into Kevin\u2019s chest, relieved at its destruction. \n",

            "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America a few months ago. He initially starts off using time travel to get rare editions of books and magazines in mint condition. However, he derails and starts getting books that do not exist. For many of his clients, they shortly ceased to exist after obtaining a book from Doc. Doc also had bought the entire stock of an ancient metaphysical order, which he then supplied to his clients. Books such as the Book of Dyzan, Book of Thoth, Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, and the Necromican were given away even if they do not exist in the present-day. These books are extremely harmful because they essentially instruct the human race on how to achieve a state of pure logic without requiring food, sex, or conflict. ",
            "After finding a method to travel in time Doc, an earthly scholar, decided to make money by bringing rare book editions from different times to his clients. But once he started bringing books that have never existed his clients disappeared soon after receiving them - at least several hundred people in North America ceased to exist after getting their order from Doc. Furthermore, time traveling allowed the \u201cunconscious racial mind\u201d to construct new worlds and realities by creating new books that were able to teach humans how to reach the state of pure logic and therefore deprive them of all humanly characteristics. ",
            "Doc\u2019s use of time travel has caused hundreds of people to disappear from North America - as if they ceased to exist. This occurred shortly after Doc gave them a book - books that were collected in metaphysical order and distributed to his liking. As a result, the interplay of time travel and bringing books and their knowledge in and out of existence has caused them to ultimately not exist, but still influence the unconscious mind into creating them. As such, it is revealed that the human mind has been able to understand and access the powers of ESP, telekinesis, etc as well as achieve states of pure logic and thought. Both immediate consequences, like the erasure of people\u2019s existence, as well as existential consequences like the potential for the power of human minds to be accessed occurred because of his time travel. \n",
            "Time travel allows the unconscious racial mind, a mind that knows the power of extrasensory perception, to go back in time and create books that do not exist before. These books allow the human race to teach itself how to turn the material body with desires into a pure logic state without the body, where they don\u2019t need sex, food, or any material supply. Therefore, when Doc uses time travel to create those books and distribute them to people, people who received the books from Doc disappear. Their material existence vanishes. And Doc himself also reaches the state of pure logic, where his material existence disappears."

The flophouse door is fly-specked, and a tubercular clerk is sitting in a gaudy comics section. The room they later go to is six feet in all directions with five feet high walls. The other foot is finished in chickenwire; there is also a wino singing on the left, wino praying on the right, and a door with no lock. There is also a gray-brown cot that Kevin lays Doc on, and a light bulb for light. Kevin also sits in a chair; the floor is littered and uncovered. The knob of the door is slick with greasy dirt. Later, Kevin goes out to the streets. They go to a restaurant, where he sits at the counter with a cup of coffee. There is also a stool for Miss Casey to sit in next to his stool. As he leaves, he notices that there is nobody on the sidewalks. Kevin describes himself opening the door to an amber world and then an azure one. Neon light also comes from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window somewhere beyond. When Kevin brings back food to the flophouse, he mentions that there are rats in the walls. Inside his mind, one man sits on an ornate armchair. Another man is sprawled in the other chair. Later, as Kevin goes back to reality, the confrontation between Miss Casey, Andre, and him happens in the same room with Doc still on the cot. ",
            "The story is set in the world where earthmen run a Solar Federation - it incorporates several different planets and population groups, including humans, Martians, Centurian humanoids, etc. Kevin, a Centurian man, and Doc, a nameless old earthman that Kevin remembers to be very important for something, walk to a flophouse. They get a small room which Kevin leaves shortly after on a search for food and coffee - he has a caffeine addiction. He meets a woman called Vivian at the bus stop and she agrees to pay for his food, leading him to a cafe. Later, he comes back to Doc who has managed to construct a device which is used for time travel as Kevin understands after he unexpectedly finds himself  in an old Victorian room. Coming back to his time and his room, Kevin meets Vivian, a North American constable, holding a gun and later, Andre, the representative of the Martians. After they tell him the truth about the consequences of time traveling and help him remember his identity, Kevin breaks the device, destroying the time travel knowledge for many years, as it seems to be the most prudent decision to him. \n",
            "This story takes place in the Solar Federation in an unnamed town or city where Earth humans, Centuarians and Martians alike all interact with each other. Tourists seem to be prevalent as well as the protagonist moves around from various locations within the setting like the bus stop, the diner or restaurant, and the motel room. The story primarily takes place in the dirty motel room where it is first inhabited by the Doc on the single bed and the protagonist, Kevin, slipping in out and then later by the stand-off between the Doc, Kevin, Vivian Casey and Andre. \nDue to the existence of time travel in this story, the setting also changes momentarily for Kevin. In the middle of the story, he finds himself in a Victorian living room, which he is able to identify due to his familiarity with Earth\u2019s history. In this temporary setting, he finds himself in the company of a thin, sickly man who sits in an ornate chair and another man filling a curved pipe with what looked like ice-skate. \n",

Throughout the whole story, he finally found out his dad, an Earthman known as Doc, had caused many people to disappear from Northern America due to the use of time travel. Time travel allows people to make things that do not exist come into existence by extrasensory perception. And the incident is caused by such an ability to create nonexistent things that would enable humans to achieve a pure immaterial logical state."

            "This story follows the life of Martin from a young boy living in a rough neighborhood to an old man dying aboard an unmanned ship. We first see Martin following the disappearance of his mother - and lack of a father - which are commonplace in the neighborhood he grows up in where the kids rarely attend school and their living conditions are poor. Martin is taken in by a young woman, Ninian, who instructs him to call her Aunt Ninian despite being identified as his future descendant. Ninian has traveled back in time to her great-great-grandfather - Martin - in order to protect him from his future son Conrad. Conrad, described as an idealist, is dismayed by the future generations exploitation of Earth and destructive social order that casts out anyone and everything that doesn't encompass the privileged and elite. To correct the wrongdoings of the future, Conrad plans to kill Martin. The rest of Conrad\u2019s cousins intercept this plan and instead, all decide to travel into the past to accompany Martin and protect him from an assassination attempt. \n\nMartin\u2019s formative years are accompanied by Ninian, Raymond and Ives where he picks up art as a career, forms impersonal relationships with his descendants and learns more about the past and future quality of life. As years pass with no threat of Conrad in sight, Martin begins to explore his world alongside Ives on a yacht named The Interregnum. Soon though, the cousins that come and go begin to blur together and Martin picks up a detached view of the world as his interest wanes in his sheltered life. Martin lives to a very old age, and on his deathbed aboard the yacht, he is surrounded by all his descendants besides Ives, who passed of sickness earlier before. It is at this moment that Conrad appears, seemingly to finish his murder plot. However, it is revealed that no action was required to be taken by Conrad, as his fellow cousins have already achieved the mission of erasing their lineage. By containing Martin to a sheltered life, the cousins prevented Martin from living his normal life with a wife and kids, thus removing the possibility of their existence in the past, present and future. Furthermore, it is revealed that Martin had come to the same conclusion years ago, and chose instead to keep quiet out of his disdain for his descendants. With the cousins horrified at the knowledge, Conrad reassures Martin that their inaction resulted in hope, and Martin ponders to wonder if the assurance was genuine as he peacefully dies alone on the boat. \n",
            "Martin\u2019s mother disappears, but nobody is surprised because mothers usually disappear around these parts. Ninian comes to take care of him, and he has no father because he was born as a war baby. Martin thinks that the story about Ninian being from the future is a gag, and he likes to bait her because she ends up crying. Ninian, however, tells him that she is protecting him from her cousin Conrad who is coming to kill him in the future. His living conditions have improved, but Martin misses his old neighborhood where he could play with the other children. Ninian and her relatives only take care of him as if it is some unpleasant duty; he learns that nobody works with hands anymore in their world because it is all done by machinery. When Martin turns sixteen, Raymond tells him about Conrad and his idealist ideas of making living fairer for the exploited natives on other planets. Conrad blames his great-grandfather for discovering the super drive. Conrad then bribes one of Professor Farka\u2019s assistants to reveal information about a time transmitter, and he plans to go back in time to eliminate the common ancestor. Raymond explains that they got plans from another assistant and a handicrafts enthusiast to build another gadget. They could guard over Martin day and night so Conrad could not attack. Raymond explains that Ninian is leaving, and Martin feels oddly desolate because of their time together. When she leaves, Ninian cries at her inadequacy; Martin and Raymond move to a luxurious mansion in a remote area that protects them from the Second Atomic War. The relatives come back to hold meetings; Martin thinks he wants to be a physicist or engineer, but the relatives insist that he should be a painter. Ives eventually takes over and displays his art in a museum, and he buys a yacht called The Interregnum to go traveling. He lives out the rest of his days on the yacht with the other descendants, but he does not care for them much. Ives explains that the future world is not that much better, and he isn\u2019t even sure if Conrad is wrong. Ives, however, ends up dying from a chill. Eventually, Martin\u2019s work is bought by a museum in Italy; he asks one cousin where Conrad is. He lies dying at one hundred and four as the relatives all come to visit. Conrad comes to visit too, and he explains to the other cousins that they will all disappear because Martin was never allowed to lead a normal life. After realizing that the other man knew all along, Raymond calls Martin a criminal, but Martin does not mind. Conrad tells him that their plan will benefit the future, but Martin is not sure if he is telling the truth or not. As Martin dies, he is the only one left on the ship because everybody else has disappeared. ",
            "The story describes the life of Martin, a young kid whose mother dies. When this happens, a new woman begins to take care of him. She, called Ninian, tells Martin that she comes from the future, and is there to take care of him. Throughout this, Martin doesn\u2019t question the motives of his caretaker. Later, it is also revealed that she is a descendant of Martin. More and more descendants of Martin come to his time in order to take care of him, taking turns of about 5 years in doing so, and are referred to as cousins. One of the cousins also reveals that the reason that they are protecting him is because one of their cousins wants to kill him. This is because one of Martin\u2019s descendants created a piece of equipment that allowed humans to travel through space, leading to humans taking advantage of native species of other planets for their own economic benefit. Conrad, the descendant who wanted to kill him, wants to stop humans from ever traveling through space. Martin continues this boring life, preparing for the eventual arrival of Conrad who wants to kill him. Throughout his boring and repetitive life, Martin begins to question the actions of his descendants. When eventually Martin is an old man and is going to die, all of his descendants get together to say goodbye. This is where Conrad finally made an appearance, and it is revealed that everything was part of Conrad\u2019s plan, as living his repetitive life Martin never had the chance to have children, therefore stopping his descendant from inventing the equipment necessary for human space travel. ",
            "The story tells about the life of a boy called Martin. At the beginning, he lives in a poor neighborhood with his mother, who disappears one day. Instead, he is now looked after by Ninian, who claims to be Martin\u2019s descendant from the future who came here to protect him from Conrad - Ninian\u2019s cousin. She hires private tutors for him and soon decides to move to a better neighborhood and live in a big well-furnished house. Occasionally, the other descendants, like Ives or Raymond, also visit them and talk about the future where almost nobody works, and everything is done by machinery. Martin turns sixteen when Raymond finally tells him the full story: Raymond's brother Conrad was disappointed by the fact that the humans of his time exploited the other life forms on the other planets to get food and resources. He decided to eliminate their common ancestor - Martin -  so that no space travel inventions would have existed. The others - cousins as he should call them - went back in time to save him and, consequently, save themselves. Martin also learns about the security system and the collection of weaponry they have to protect him. Soon Ninian leaves, and Martin, together with Raymond, moves into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. They talk about Martin\u2019s future occupation. Though he prefers engineering or physics, they choose art to avoid any accidental premature inventions he can create since he is already familiar with the science of the future. Martin becomes a second-rate artist, and his new guardian - Ives - arrives. He decides to buy a yacht - The Interregnum - and see the rest of the world with Martin. Martin doesn\u2019t develop any special feelings for his ancestors, except for Ives. Martin learns more about the future from him: only an enclave of a couple of million people left on Earth, and representatives of the lower classes got deported to the other planets and are being exploited; several worlds have already been made inhabitable. Ives admits that his brother is not completely wrong, but he still cannot let him destroy his life. \n\nOne winter, Ives rapidly dies from a severe chill in Tierra del Fuego after they stopped there for a bit. Years go by, and Martin loses any interest in life, sometimes painting the sea view from the yacht. They stop in Italy, and he sells two paintings. Wars force them to go to different hemispheres and the Arctic. Eventually, Martin turns a hundred and four when his last illness comes. Finally, Conrad appears. He shocks all the gathered ancestors by explaining that the sheltered life they had created for Martin didn\u2019t allow him to live his own life, or at least, have kids. When he dies, everyone will disappear, too. Martin figured it out years ago. Conrad assures him that his deed leads to a better future because he has been there. Erasing the future all his ancestors came from, Martin peacefully dies on the yacht, which drifts for years about the seas. "

            "Cousin Ives enters Martin\u2019s life when he is a little older, and is the third descendant to accompany him as his guardian. Out of all his descendants to assume guardianship, Martin forms the closest relationship with Ives. Rather than seeing Martin as a responsibility and duty, Ives sees Martin as an individual and seeks ways to connect and encourage his passions. For one, Ives buys a yacht named The Interregnum to which the pair take upon themselves to explore the current world in. They traveled across the waters and inland to see both the civilized and uncivilized world, with Martin taking it all in. \n\nWhen it was just the two of them, their relationship progressed further. Ives began to open up about the future world that he and his descendants come from and explain the nuances of the social order that rules. Ives is the first to explicitly and honestly describe the feudal and privileged social class that Martin\u2019s descendants take part in, only due to their fortunate ancestry. Additionally, Ives is the only cousin to admit the potential truth in Conrad\u2019s intentions, noting the dilemma between achieving moral good and selfishing maintaining their own good life. Martin even comments his confidence in Ives being able to see the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans. However, during one winter, Ives fell ill to a severe chill and passed away before his own birth. After Ives\u2019 death, Martin relently voyages across oceans and soon as they and the cousins blur, he begins to live detachedly. \n",
            "Martin shares a much better relationship with Ives than with the rest of the cousins. He is told to call Ives his cousin because he is older when Ives takes responsibility. Martin begins to paint more, and Ives arranges to have his works shown in a gallery. When there is little interest in his artwork, Ives reassures him that people will grow to enjoy them. Martin also thinks that Ives is the only one who tries to see him as an individual, even arranging a yacht to be bought so they can see the world. Martin likes spending time with Ives, and Ives also tells him about the world of the future. He explains to Martin that there is no poverty because only a couple million elusive and privileged people are left on the planet. Ives also explains that this system had been deliberately planned, leaving the lower class people and other planets\u2019 natives to suffer. He also is not even sure that Conrad\u2019s thinking is wrong, but he cannot bring himself to watch his way of life change. When Ives dies from his chill, Raymond makes a speech about his death not being in vain. Martin, however, disagrees. When Martin\u2019s paintings are bought later by an Italian museum, he thinks back to what Ives had said before and feels uncomfortable. As Martin lies dying, he thinks about how Ives is lucky to have been spared the same tragedy as the young people surrounding him. ",
            "Ives is one of Martin's descendants who wants to protect him from the eventual arrival of Conrad to kill Martin. Ives and Martin have a very good relationship, as Ives tries to help Martin in his painting career. Ives also tells Martin of everything that has gone on in the future, and why Conrad wants to kill him. Martin would also contemplate life with Ives, and question the actions of the cousins. Ives also takes the effort to connect emotionally with Martin, which is when Ives dies it makes Martin very sad. ",
            "Ives is the first so-called cousin who respects Martin and sees an individual in him. Ives seems to be smarter than the other cousins and is also more honest with him. He admits that the future is not as ideal as Raymond and Ninian claim. He says Conrad was not completely wrong about the unfairness of the future\u2019s way of life, but Ives himself still lacks the moral courage to be like him. Martin likes Ives, and even after the cousin dies, he thinks about him when he is older. "

            "The \u2018cousins\u2019 featured in this story are all direct descendants of Martin, identified to be great-great-granddaughters and -sons. Instructed to be called Aunts and Uncles by a young Martin and then later cousins by a mature Martin, they have rallied together to travel into the past in order to protect and guard Martin from an assassination attempt by Conrad. Conrad, a fellow cousin, is thought to be an idealist by his fellow cousins and adamantly wrong in his belief that the right thing to do is to erase their lineage in order to correct injustice in their future society. Despite the heroic protection of Martin, we find out that the cousins\u2019 guardianship of Martin is selfish in nature. Aside from Ives, Martin holds largely impersonal relationships with his cousins, who appear to view Martin as a reluctant duty. Because of Conrad as a looming threat over Martin\u2019s livelihood, a rotation of cousins traveling from the future assume guardianship over Martin and dictates his life in his hobbies or the information he knows - all to protect their own livelihood. \n\nAt Martin\u2019s deathbed, we find out that the cousins have had the wrong idea this entire time. In their insistence at protecting Martin and shaping his life to what they created for him, they signed their own death warrant. In all their planning and supposed intelligence and worthiness, the cousins have failed to observe the flaw in the plan: that if Martin had no wife and no children, then their very existence would be naught. Their forced presence in Martin\u2019s life had rid Martin\u2019s potential exciting existence - and in return - Martin\u2019s lackluster existence had rid the cousins of any kind of existence. \n",
            "The role of the \u2018cousins\u2019 in the story is to protect Martin from Conrad coming to kill him. When Conrad begins to idealize a better world, the \u2018cousins\u2019 realize that this will change their way of life forever. Therefore, they decide to go back in time and protect Martin, so there is no way for Conrad to kill him. They must protect Martin because the \u2018cousins\u2019 are Martin\u2019s descendants from the future. The \u2018cousins\u2019 begin looking after Martin shortly after he is born, and they make him their responsibility to ensure that Conrad fails in his goals. The \u2018cousins\u2019 also use their vast family wealth to move him to a better neighborhood and hire tutors. Later, Raymond uses this money to move them to a remote mansion, where he continues to look after Martin. They even pool their resources to have him become an artist, and Ives later buys The Interregnum to go traveling. The \u2018cousins\u2019 are determined to change Martin\u2019s fate from the future without even realizing that they end up destroying themselves because they have controlled his life for so long. ",
            "The cousins have a very important role in the story, as they took it upon themselves to save Martin\u2019s life, and stop their other cousin from killing him. By doing this, they end up basically ruining Martin's life, as in their efforts to protect him they stopped him from having a normal and happy life. It can also be said that cousin Conrad was in the right, as he was willing to sacrifice his life in order to stop the disastrous actions of humans in the future. ",
            "After one of the descendants - Conrad - seemingly pans to go back in time and kill his ancestor - Martin, his other relatives decide to defend him from Conrad. They create a sheltered life for him and start taking care of Martin at the very beginning of the story, changing their shifts after some years. They make Martin move to different houses and then to a yacht, where he spends the rest of his life. They choose a profession for him, explain the future to him, and remind him about Conrad. They completely changed his life, erasing the future he was supposed to have. Simultaneously, they unconsciously ruin their own existence because, as we learn at the end, their overprotection didn\u2019t enable Martin to have a real life or a family with kids. Their unkind attitude towards Martin also doesn\u2019t make him emotionally connected to them. And he doesn\u2019t tell them about the mistake they made, eventually deciding that this version of the future probably should not exist."

            "First, time is significant in this story as the main plotline to the cousins' interactions with Martin. With the future having time travel as a reality, characters in this story like Ninian are able to jump back and forth between the past - to bring Martin out of poverty and vulgar background - and the future to her present time. Although the characters in this story utilize time as an unchangeable and linear concept, we find out through hints in the story and at the final moment that time here is fluid and flexible. Anything that occurs in the past will affect the reality of the future. This is a startling pocket of truth that the cousins fail to realize until Martin\u2019s deathbed - where they are horrified to find out that their selfish desire to protect their comfortable reality in the future had actually led to their own demise and ridded their entire existence. \n\nAdditionally, time is used to explore the ruling ideologies of the social class both in present and in future. Despite the cousins proclaiming the future world to be free of poverty and highly privileged, Ives reveals that the realities of both worlds are similar in having wars and want and suffering. Only, with the latter future world dealing with these unsavory characters in exiling them and maintaining a feudal class system. \n",
            "Time is very significant in this story because it relates to all characters. Conrad uses the time transmitter from Professor Farka to travel to the future to observe different possibilities. He also travels back one last time to see the dying Martin and tell him what they are doing for the universe\u2019s interest. Martin\u2019s descendants travel back in time to protect him from Conrad, but they control most of his life to the point where he has no free will. Martin, however, sees his time as abundant because he spends most of his time with his relatives anyways. They are the only people he ever interacts with, and he finds himself living a purposeless life with all of the free time that he has. However, time is also significant in that it is what eventually erases all of his descendants from the past, present, and future. ",
            "Time plays a significant role in this story. Time is what allowed Martin's descendant to invent space travel, and is what eventually led to Conrad trying to kill him. Also, the cousins used time travel in order to go back to Martin\u2019s time and to try and protect him from Conrad\u2019s actions. Another important thing about time is that the cousins never aged as they protected Martin, leading to them stuck forever protecting Martin, until Martin dies, after which they never existed. ",
            "Time in this story becomes a very flexible notion, allowing Martin\u2019s descendants to use time travel to find him in the past and protect Martin from Conrad, who wants to kill him, thus erasing the timeline in which humans use exploitation of other people and life forms. Thanks to time travel, Martin can meet his descendants and learn what the future looks like for humans. Their arrival changes his life, and initially, he becomes anxious and curious but eventually loses interest in everything around him because his sheltered existence deprives him of any real feelings, except for fear of Conrad. Their plan leads to the elimination of the future they came from, showing how changing the past events affects the future. "

            "When Ninian initially arrives, Martin blatantly considers her to be dumb. Dumb to hire a cleaning maid, dumb to freak out over Martin\u2019s absence at school, and dumb to hire a private tutor. Even with them moving to a different and more privileged neighborhood, he considers her dumb to go through all this effort to still remain conspicuous. \n\nAs the reasons behind the cousins\u2019 presence in the past and guardianship over Martin is revealed, his sentiment towards them remains the same. It seems that Martin is able to catch onto the obvious flaw in the cousins\u2019 plans quite early on, and yet with so many cousins slipping in and out, and despite their proclaimed intelligence, none of them are able to pick up on this flaw. The flaw being: with Martin having no children, their very existence becomes an impossibility. This is revealed at the end of the story where Martin is on his deathbed, noting that he had come to this conclusion many years before and had chosen not to say anything. \n",
            "Martin's attitude towards the cousins does not ever really change throughout the story. Initially, he thinks that Ninian is foolish and fun to bait because she wounds up crying. Although Ninian does her best to care for him, he knows that all of his relatives are only doing it out of their interest. They see him as a rather unpleasant duty, while he does not try to get to know them either. When Raymond talks to him, he looks down on Martin and tries to be superior. Even when they move on to the yacht later, Martin only associates with them to not seem rude. The only cousin he becomes fond of is Ives because Ives is the only one who sees Martin as an individual. Martin becomes used to having them around, but it becomes difficult to tell them apart because there are many. Most of them are only interested in fulfilling their responsibility, so he does not get to know them apart from Ives. Even when the cousins realize from Conrad what they have done by controlling Martin, he is not surprised by how inept his descendants are. He does not seem too regretful about what his descendants have done until the end. ",
            "At the beginning Martin believed the actions of his cousins, and everything they told him. While he got older and older, he started to see the flaws in the plans of his cousins. He understood that if they continued in that cycle then he would never live his life and have children. Even though he knew the flaws, he always followed what the cousins said, and never pointed out the flaws to them. He decided to follow the role that the cousins wanted him to follow. ",
            "At the beginning of the story, Martin is curious about Ninian. But as other cousins arrive, he becomes less and less interested in them. They do not seem incredibly bright or eager to get to know him. They show that they are carrying out duty and never bother to be more considerate or show excitement. The only cousin that Martin likes is Ives because he tries to see Martin as an individual and is brighter than his other relatives. Martin\u2019s cousins cut him off from the life he got used to and never allow him to make his own decisions. He is trapped in their plan to save their lives, and they don't try to be respectful or care about his desires. Even when he is dying, their faces show a sign of relief. In general, Martin never felt any love or compassion for his descendants."

            "The Starship Pandora lands on a planet where an exploring ship and a rescue group disappear. Captain Gwayne was ordered to come and inspect the lost ships for a week. They prolong their stay because of a discovery of the carefully buried ship whose parts were exposed by a landslide and detected by a metal locator a few days ago. When two cadets, Kaufman and Pinelli, and one member, Doctor Barker, approach to examine the buried ship, a horde of mysterious creatures come to them. The leader of mysterious creatures, tall and man-like, kidnaps the two cadets with his members and runs away. Captain Gwayne and other crew members ride on jeeps and chase after the monsters. When they catch up to the mysterious leader, the cadets are sitting on each shoulder of the leader without harm. Captain Gwayne and Doctor Barker collaborate to defeat the leader and bring it back to the ship.\n\nAfter bringing back the captive, Captain Gwayne has learned from the creature that he is Hennessy, the missing captain of the buried ship. He reveals that the blobs, a peculiarity on the planet, can change the cells in living creatures to help them adapt to the planet, which has done to Captain Hennessy and his crew members. All the mysterious creatures surrounding the ship are either the original crew members or their descendants. They decided to bury the ship after noticing the changes. After he finished the story, Captain Hennessy went to gather with his people. And now, Captain Gwayne faces the same situation as Captain Hennessy did in the past: either die when they go back to the Earth or stay on the planet to become a different creature, which at least makes humankind survive differently. Captain Gwayne decides to stay, so he discharges all the fuel out to not let the ship live again. He then tells Jane Corey, the Lieutenant, the truth and his decision. They both know that they have to stay for the better strength of the species after generations because humankind needs to have at least one hope to spread their seeds, even in a different shape. They will obliterate all their traces so that the Earth will send no more humans to the planet.\n",
            "Captain Gwayne is a weary fourty-year old man who captains the starship Pandora, as one of the many colonies traveling around space to find a new planet that can sustain human life like Earth. Accompanied by Lieutenant Jane Corey, he is informed that two of the space cadets snuck outside the ship. Among the outside landscape includes blobs, who are described to be a peculiarity of this particular planet; seemingly harmless but are ugly in looks.\n\nGwayne wishes to study them more thoroughly, but is reminded of his mission in deviating to this planet to search for Captain Hennessey and his men, who had abandoned their ship. As the cadets are heading back to Gwayne\u2019s ship, a herd of blobs disperses in excitement and instead they begin to hover over a singular spot. The cadets turn to find a horde of things heading towards them, described to be vaguely man-like with a distinct leader at eight feet tall, and all of them holding objects like spears or sticks. In a race to reach the cadets before the things did, Gwayne, Jane and other officers raced in Jeeps towards the boys. Noticing the incoming Jeeps, the creatures grabbed the boys and disappeared into the mists, with the officers following fast in pursuit. Plowing through them, Gwayne touches a blob whose shape passes around it. As they confront the eight foot leader, it suddenly drops the boys and Gwayne and Doc Barker knock it out of consciousness. \n\nWith the boys safe, they take the unconscious creature back to the ship to try and see if the creature had anything to do with Hennessey\u2019s disappearance and buried ship. Any information revealed would be pivotal in determining this planet\u2019s habitability, as it is revealed that Earth was threatened with the Sun going nova and hence the human race found themselves in a scramble to find a replacement home. Gwayne and Jane then visit Barker and the now-awake creature, who immediately greets Gwayne in some garbled English. They find out that the leader of the creature is actually Captain Hennessy who had grabbed the kids with the intention of talking to them. It turns out that Hennessey and his crew have physically changed due to the planet, turning them into man-like creatures with an adapted English language. \n\nMore so, it is revealed that blobs enjoy having the humans around, and are subtly changing and adapting the human cells. It is what happened to Hennessy and is already happening to Gwayne because he\u2019s been touched. However, the rest of his crew could go back but are unable to because Gwayne has dumped the fuel. In the end, we find out that Gwayne and Jane consider the answer to finding a new planet to be void, as they only thing they could do is find a new spawning ground, which they would be able to achieve if both crews spawn a new race on this planet and eventually, explore the star lanes once again. \n",
            "The story is about a ship captain, Gwayne, and his team arriving on a new planet. It is revealed that they were on that planet because two different expeditions had gone there before and neither had returned, so Gwayne and his team were there to see what had happened. It is also revealed that Earth\u2019s sun was going nova, which is why humans were exploring and looking to colonize other planets. The planet is inhabited by blobs, spirit-like alien creatures, who seem harmless. Gwayne sends 2 kids to check the planet, and when they return the ship and the crew are ambushed by a horde of alien-like creatures. When the leader captures the two cadets, Gwayne rushes out and, with the help of another crew member, rescues the kids and captures the leader. When the crew\u2019s doctor checks the leader, they find out that the creature is actually the captain of the previous mission, and Gwayne\u2019s friend. Gwayne realizes that this was the blobs\u2019 doing, and that they can change and adapt the body of human beings. After this is revealed, the crew decides that they should all stay on the planet, and bury the ship. This would allow the humans to create a new colony there with the blobs, and allow them to help each other, as the blobs could in a far future help the changed humans adapt to different planets. ",
            "The starship Pandora creaks and groans as she settles on an ugly world. The starship is two hundred light-years away from Earth. Captain Gwayne curses and reaches for his boots; he shuffles to the control room where Lieutenant Jane Corey is waiting. Jane reports that a dozen mysterious blobs held a convention north, but they had broken off about an hour ago. She also informs him that the two cadets have snuck out again, to which Gwayne swears because Kaufman and Pinelli have no sense of caution. The Sol-type Sun begins to rise, but there is so much fog everywhere that it is impossible to see. He observes three blobs but knows that there is no time because Earth sent him here to check for any signs of Hennessy\u2019s ship. Suddenly, Jane calls him to say that the two cadets are back. Strange creatures appear, and Gwayne yells at Jane to get the jeeps out. Once they drive, the menacing horde notices the jeeps and begins to run away with the cadets faster. Although the creatures try to stop their pursuers, the jeep goes through and catches a glimpse. Once the creature with the two cadets is in front of him, Gwayne dives to get the cadets back. Doc Barker hits the creature seconds after, and this causes the creature to collapse. The men examine the cadets, while Doc and Gwayne wonder if the creature could be the key to the missing ship. They discuss how the native creatures could have gone undetected, while Gwayne explains that it is time for him to go and get the ship back to Earth. The report from the cadets is enough, but there are still a lot of questions regarding the creatures and the missing crew. However, there needs to be an answer fast because Earth is close to extinction from the Sun. Since nobody would be able to live in the Solar System when that happens, the explorers must go out and find another world. Everybody does their part because the Sun will explode in ten years, while some of the strange planets would give man the opportunity to repopulate. Gwayne receives a call from Doc Barker and goes to see the creature. The creature is Captain Hennessy, and he has forgotten how to speak English because they had to change the language to make the sounds fit. When Gwayne questions the creature, it answers correctly; they listen to Hennessy\u2019s story. Gwayne leads former Hennessy out and goes back to the control room to discharge the ship\u2019s fuel tanks. It is revealed that the blobs can adapt to cells and have no choice but to stay because they are already changed. Jane figures that they have really not been changed yet, but she concludes spawning ground. The fifty men and women can replenish the Earth here, and Gwayne knows that their children would one day find a way to the star lanes again to spread the children of men further. "

It turns out that the blobs had great curiosity and interest in the humans and desired to keep them around, and so through contact with the humans, eventually changed and adapted their cells to be able to live on this planet.

They can change the cells in any living thing to adapt to the planet. They like humans, so they change their cells to let them stay on the planet.\n\nThe blobs are the main reason why Captain Hennessy and Gwayne decide to stay on the planet. They choose to stay because the blobs make them able to survive on the planet without having to change the whole planet to do so. Without the blobs, they may leave to search for other planets that can let humans survive. But with the blobs, someday in the future, humans may be able to seek out more possibilities in other worlds where the blobs will help them adapt to the new environments.

Observed as seemingly harmless and curious, the blobs aren\u2019t given too much caution in the beginning of the story. However, the behavior of the blobs seem to indicate the presence of humans or creatures and as the story continues, are revealed to play a role in the latter. \n\nIt turns out that the blobs have adaptive capabilities to them - and have already used these capabilities to change the cell structure of Hennessy and his crew - changing them from humans to man-like creatures. While they are no longer like Earth humans, these man-like creatures are able to survive on this planet. This is significant because this story details man\u2019s mission in searching for a habitable planet and the survival of the human race  - and through the blob\u2019s amusement of man and adaptive capabilities - have discovered this form of survival. Rather than humans colonizing the planet like we may assume, the blobs indicate the planet changing the humans and signify the new reality for Captain Gwayne and his crew. \n",

Because of the impending explosion of the sun, humans are desperately looking for different planets where humans can live.

The blobs find people amusing and like having them around. Gwayne mentions that life before man came used to have twelve legs, but the blobs have changed that. Another reason why the blobs are significant is that they have adapted man to the alien world instead of the other way around. Since men usually have to adapt the planet to their needs, being touched by a blob does the opposite and brings a human further away from human society. "

Again everyone seems aloof: Henry\u2019s overly affectionate mother now barely touches him and even cries for several minutes, his aunt and uncle cannot talk about casual things - no one looks him in the eyes. After all, Devers gets infuriated and screams at the guests, they leave, and his son once again tries to leave instead of spending time with the parents. Later in the evening, Edith wakes her husband because his good friends Phil and Rhona came - they all go to bowling alleys and then to a tavern. Even Devers\u2019 close friends seem stiff and cautious while talking to him, dancing with him, being around him. On their way back, Phil tries to make a joke about a cemetery but stops himself from finishing it - this upsets Henry even more, completely ruining the evening. When they get home Edith tries to apologize to her husband and admits that she\u2019s frightened. In reply, he says that soon such regenerative technologies and processes will be an ordinary thing, and his captain, for example, who died together with Devers, will soon leave the hospital, too. She asks him to be patient with everybody. \n\n",
            "There is a welcoming crowd and politicians giving speeches. However, the mayor and crowd are much quieter than the last welcoming. His Honor\u2019s handclasp is somewhat moist and cold, with eyes holding traces of remoteness. Henry Devers is still honored, and there is a tour up Main street to where the mayor waits alongside a young homecoming queen. Hank looks out to the crowd, and there is a lot of national interest because he is the First One. He is glad that the official greeting is over, and all he wants to do is see his family again. When Hank goes back to 45 Roosevelt Street, the house has changed for the better. He is glad not to have to deal with more strangers and is surprised by having to use the ornamental knocker on the new door. Edith opens the door with their son Ralphie in her arms, and the family shares a sweet moment. Edith hesitates to take a seat next to him. When Hank asks about Ralphie, the boy says that it is now summer vacation. However, Edith says that he has been doing excellent in school. He remembers back to their farewells at the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. Ralphie suddenly says he must go to pitch for the Inter-Town Little League; Hank tells Edith that he is tired. She leads him upstairs, where there are two twin beds in entirely new furniture. Hank assumes that Edith has created this barrier between them because he has changed too much. When she leaves, Hank goes to look at his scars. He hopes Edith does not have to see them, even though he did not consider the scars when he left the Walter Reed Hospital. As Hank dozes off, he thinks about wishing to regain his old relationships. His mother, Uncle Joe, and Aunt Lucille all come when dinner approaches. Hank tries to compliment his mother over grapefruit, and she bursts into tears. Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille make little to no attempts to talk either, making Hank angry because nobody treats him like a human being. Hank falls asleep, but Phil and Rhona come to take everyone to a bowling alley. Hank agrees to Phil\u2019s request to drink and continues to do so in Manfred\u2019s Tavern. He tries to dance with Rhona, who looks as if she will be sick, and even his wife is reluctant to dance with him. When the entire party drives back, Hank jokes about a cemetery and wonders if he should just lie in an open grave. Edith tries to apologize to him and says that they all need some time to get used to him being back when he should have died. Hank tells her that the government is doing everything they can and that he has not seen anything in the six and half months. However, when he lays in his bed, he thinks back to the monsters and is glad to be in his own house. ",

He still gets a big welcome from the nation and his family, but it is not the same anymore. He feels the awkward silence in the ceremony and parade when it was once lively and welcoming. His family no longer touches him as they did before because they are now afraid of him. Things have changed after he left, and it is not the same anymore. He feels uneasy and angry. He wants the old normality and urges to be accepted by his family and close friends, but people are too scared to act normally to him. They treat him as some monster. Henry knows that it takes time for people to accept him, but it is also true that people like him will become normal in the future, and there must be a time when his family takes him as an ordinary person again.

Svan then initiates a revolting plan against the Earthman.\n\nBy showing this conversation to the group, Svan convinces the members to conduct his plan of not letting the Earthman ship go back to the Earth. In his plan, they will drive near the ship, five people will cause some chaos to attract the guards, and one person will put the delayed-action atomite bomb on the ship. They draw lots to determine when they decide who will put the bomb. However, Svan finds that no one admits to being the one, so he draws a cross on his slip, pretending to be the one who has terrible luck. \n\nAfter assigning the tasks to each person, Svan and his members drive to cross the border, where Svan brings down a native guard. When they separate to let one group cause the commotion and let Svan put the bomb, Svan takes out one bomb and leaves another one in the car. He knows that the bomb on the car will explode and attract the Earthman guards, which is unknown by the other members. He sees the car leave and turns to wait for the explosion. But the car comes back because the native guards found the rifle left by the murdered guard. The members in the car try to pick up Svan to flee from the search of the Earthman when Svan tries his best to run away. The explosion happens.

When the humans arrive, a group of natives called \u201cThe Council\u201d decided to bomb the ship of the humans. To decide the person who would sneak on the ship to plant the bomb, the natives marked a slip with an X and randomly picked slips. When no one came forward, the leader of the natives, Svan, decided to do it himself. Because the person with the X didn\u2019t come forward, Svan didn\u2019t trust his group anymore. Therefore, after the group sneaked past a guard, Svan decided to blow up both the car with his team and the ship.

Lowry adds that it\u2019s possible but is interrupted by a loud voice notifying them about a spy ray focused on their lock. The Exec alerts their guards and the delegation. \n\nThe ray was used by Svan and five other representatives of the Council - an underground organization fighting against any partnerships with humans. They hear Lowry\u2019s words, and Svan becomes infuriated. He persuades everyone, including Ingra who initially hesitates, that they can\u2019t let the delegation come back to Earth. Svan plans to plant a bomb in the ship, it will detonate on the delegation\u2019s way back, killing everyone. Others are uncertain, so Svan decides to randomly pick the one who will plant the bomb. When he sees that his slip is blank, he thinks that someone is afraid to admit that they had the slip with the cross. So Svan quickly marks his slip and pretends to be the one who was initially chosen. He explains the specifics of their plan: while he will be near the ship, the others will fake a car accident to draw some guards which will allow Svan to get in. Their car is stopped by the State Guard who realizes that Svan is the reason the state of danger was declared. Svan kills the guard and hides the body. He takes one bomb and leaves another one in the car, hoping that the explosion will draw enough attention and punish the five people he now considers fearful traitors. Before the car takes off, Ingra kisses Svan. He waits near the ship fumbling with his slip and wondering who the coward was. Suddenly, he hears the car is driving back. Ingra screams that they were chased, but got away and came back for Svan. He starts running from the car, realizing the bomb inside it is supposed to detonate. The explosion wave knocks him out. Later, he wakes up near a surgeon, who calmly declares that Svan will soon die from the wounds, and shocked Lowry. The surgeon is confused by a paper slip with a cross marked on both sides he found clenched in Svan\u2019s hand. ",
            "In James Mac Creigh's short story Doublecross, the actions revolve around two opposing sides of the storyline of the planet Venus. The Officer of the Deck on the Earth spaceship reports to The Executive Officer about a pathetic underground group of dissidents who spread the rumor that immigrants will kill the indigenous Venusians, descendants of the first expedition. During their arrogant conversation, the ship receives news of an attempted attack.\n\tAn underground organization controlled by an indigenous Venusian, Svan, overhears the ship's delegation's conversation about their contemptuous attitude towards the natives. Svan is determined not to let the Earth colonizers leave Venus and destroy the ship before its departure. The council informs the Venusians that only they had the right to decide the course of action. The underground organization agrees that if the Earth ship returned, it would mean disaster for Venus. Therefore, it should not return. Svan plans to sneak aboard at night and attach the Atomit magnetic time bomb to the ship. However, the commander faces the problem of betrayal, indecision, and cowardice among his renegade team. Svan suggests that the operation draws lots to decide who will be honored to perform the most critical part of the plan - the attachment of the bomb. He draws a small cross on one of the random papers in the bowl for the draw. After distributing the pieces of paper, Svan realizes that none of the team members agrees to reveal the brave one, fulfilling his duty to the people of Venus. The current political situation scares the six conspirators to attempt their expedition. After a fight with the guard, Svan and his team successfully make their way to the ship, but a second bomb turns out to be in Svan's possession and put into the car of his subordinates. Not only does Svan plan to explode the colonizers' ship, but also to take out revenge on his crew. As soon as he thinks of killing two birds with one stone: the Earth colonizers and five traitors, one of the team members Ingra, kisses Svan before going on board and wishes him good luck. Svan is thrown into a shudder, realizing that he is making a fatal mistake. As a result of his confusion, both bombs explode: in his pocket and the car of his accomplices. \nDying on the table of an Earth surgeon on the ship he was trying to destroy, Svan overhears a conversation between the Watch assistant Lowry and the doctor. While examining his clothes, he finds a piece of paper with two marked crosses as a symbol that Svan framed himself because of his fiery and distrustful temper."

While dusk was gathering and the underground organization was preparing for an attack, fog covered the swampy area of Venus. Rows of guards lined up around the Earth ship. They were keeping the machine safe from a hundred-yard distance away from it, scaring local onlookers with old-fashioned rifles, who came to be surprised by the ship. As soon as dusk deepened and a misty haze fell on the planet, six oppositionists moved towards the anticipated battle. They were illuminating the narrow and pale road with the yellowish headlights of the trailer. They noticed the twisted vegetation of the surrounding jungle. As they moved, the rain intensified, but the downpour was supposed to subside before midnight. The rain was still drizzling over the marshy area, but this did not prevent Svan from putting his plan into action despite Ingra's persuasions to drown the car in the swamp and create a commotion. As Svan headed toward the midnight road, the ground rose, and the jungle thinned. Looking into the distance, the bright lights of an Earth ship flickered in the rainclouds, landing in the center of a clearing created by its ferocious rockets. Seeing the whirling figures of the sentries, Svan realized they were the ship's guards. Despite their thin-shaft blasters, they wouldn't be as easy to defeat as the natives. He could only board by deception."

The Marsmen are called Slimeheads, honoring in their title the Chlorella and Scenedesmus algae that open the road to the wider space without by filling the spaces within. The Ship\u2019s Cook is described to be the most vital man on a spacer because he is the one who turns offal into eatables. There are also instances described where the cooks have messed up and created disasters for fellow crew members, such as poisoning them. Paul Vilanova, the narrator, goes on to tell what happened on the Charles Partlow Sale. The ship is to take a low-energy route and carries various seeds of plantlife. There are the Registry minimum of six men and three officers aboard, including Paul the surgeon, Willy Winkelmann the captain, and Robert Bailey the cook. The cook is responsible for the livelihood of all the men on the ship, and the algae also helped feed the men in a way where they cannot afford the luxury of squeamishness. Although Paul is the surgeon, he rarely lifts a knife in space because his duties are more in line with serving as a morale officer and wailing-wall. Captain Winkelman is described to have a heart of helium ice and is extremely unpopular. Bailey is often his target, but he tries his best as the Ship Cook to feed everybody in a way that makes the algae somewhat appetizing. Paul admits that he does not like the Captain much, but he tells Bailey that his cooking is what keeps the captain retaining his plump figure. Bailey cooks them a luxurious meal the next day, but the captain only criticizes him. Bailey tries to ask what Captain Winkelman wants from him, and even Paul says that he is going to crack from being driven so hard. The Captain tells him that he is simply trying to widen Bailey\u2019s horizons in terms of cooking. Bailey tries to avoid the Captain during meal time after, and Paul believes that he is the finest cook to go into the Hohmann orbit. Even though everybody is impressed by his dishes, Winkelmann still refuses to compliment him despite gaining weight from eating. When Bailey tries to convince the Captain of his food again, Winkelmann takes out a bottle of ketchup to eat with his meal. Bailey is furious, while Paul tries to cheer him up over some fifty cc\u2019s of rye. After the therapeutic drinking, Bailey begins to cook awful looking and tasting dishes. Winkelman, ironically, tells Bailey that he is improving even though the other crew members complain. When Paul goes to visit Bailey again later, one of the crew members exclaims that the cook has managed to make the algae taste similar to real food. Paul tells him that this is the result of the Captain\u2019s continuous pushing; he answers that he does like the Captain when Bailey asks him again. ",
            "This story follows several men aboard the Ship, specifically focused on the Ship\u2019s Cook Bailey, the Captain Willy Winkelmann and the narrator of the story, the Ship\u2019s Surgeon Paul Vilanova. The story chronicles the importance of food in space, in particular, the trials of the Ship\u2019s Cook in making delectable food out of ship-offal, which all food is made out of. \n\nThe Ship\u2019s Cook, Bailey, is introduced to us as someone who feeds his shipmates by groundside standards. He hides the synthetic and off-putting tastes of the algal repasts with spices like oregano and thyme, and uses his culinary techniques to shape and reuse the offals into mock-meats and other familiar meals. His fellow ship mates are satisfied with the tastes and creativeness of the meals - with none of them losing the typical weight aboard a ship and their Captain Winkelmann, actually, gaining more weight instead. Despite this, the Captain verbalizes his dissatisfaction and criticizes each meal. Every time Bailey ups the ante in the tastes or creativeness of a meal prepared, the Captain\u2019s critique only increases further. The story\u2019s narrator aids the Cook's support and reassures him of the delicious quality of the food he prepares, second to none of the narrator\u2019s past ship experiences. As part of his role in crew morale, the narrator tries to reason with the Captain in driving Bailey too hard, but to no avail. \n\nAt his breaking point, Bailey prepares the ship and the Captain an exquisite steak meal, mimicking its real texture, only to be insulted by the Captain bringing out ketchup and declaring it palpable only with the condiment. Respectfully telling off the Captain, the narrator brings Bailey back to his bunkers and reaches for alcohol as a healing power of nature, again reassuring him and commending him for taking the pressure. The next morning, the crew is served a disgusting pottage of the algae and finally, Bailey receives the Captain\u2019s approval. The narrator is proud, willing to take the bad meals for the rest of the trip in exchange for Bailey overcoming the Captain and gaining his psychic defenses. After a day, the crew mates are rewarded by Bailey\u2019s newest concoction: a barbecued steak that is complimented to actually taste of food and be delicious. The narrator reveals that the Captain\u2019s relentless critique was actually to improve Bailey\u2019s culinary skills and for the good of the ship, and is rewarded with another piece of the artificial steak. \n",
            "The story is about the crew of a spaceship that is making their way to Mars. At the beginning, the main character, Paul Vilanova, relates the importance of food in these trips. He says that the cook in a ship has the power to either make a trip or break a trip. On this particular trip, the cook is Robert Bailey. He is very talented, but the captain of the trip believes that he isn't. Throughout the story, the Captain continuously berates Bailey for the lack of quality in his cooking, even though Paul and the rest of the ship are really impressed with the food. Bailey is forced to cook with algae, as it allows for long trips and gives men all the necessary nutrients that they need. When the Captain begins to put ketchup on Bailey\u2019s delicacies, he takes this as the last straw and begins to lower the quality of the cooking severely. Lastly, Bailey gives a steak that seemed to be perfect, perfectly cooked and a perfect replica of a real steak. It is hinted that this steak is actually human meat, and that Bailey killed the Captain. \n",
            "The story talks about the future in which people are traveling between different planets. The ones that do that are called the spacers. They spend a lot of time in space, and, thus, need to eat a lot. The solution of this future is algae that feed the men and help keep the ship a sustainable system. The narrator of the story is Paul Vilanova, a spacer. Sometime in the past, he traveled to Mars on a ship called The Sale. He was the board surgeon, the captain was Willy Winkelmann - a very unapproachable man. Their cook - the most important person on the ship because he had to apply biochemistry and dietetics to cook nourishing food from Chlorella algae - was called Robert Bailey, he was originally from Ohio. Vilanova describes a very tense relationship between the cook and the captain: Willy Winkelmann, an unpleasant person he was, was always mispronouncing the cook's name and criticizing his dishes. \n\nHe served a three-course dinner and the crew thanked him, but the captain found his food disgusting and left the dinner with a small scandal. Later, Bailey talked to the surgeon about the captain and complained about his insulting remarks. Paul assured him that no one could make Winkelmann happy and that the food was way above average. The next day the captain made an offensive comment about Bailey's cooking abilities again. Paul tried to talk to Winkelmann about his harsh attitude towards Bailey, and the captain said that he believed this attitude would make the cook improvise and experiment more. Paul disagreed but was soon told to leave. Bailey started avoiding the captain but was still called from the kitchen almost every time. The other crew members enjoyed this conflict since it made Bailey cook in a more creative way. One day Paul even learned that instead of taking anything meaningful on the board Winkelmann had just brought a box of ketchup to help him eat the spacers\u2019 food and humiliate Bailey even more. After another offensive monologue from the captain, the cook became angry and started talking back, but Winkelmann quickly excused him and Paul, who had tried to defend Bailey. Later Paul gave the cook some rye and listened to him cursing and insulting the captain. The next morning Bailey cooked something unusually disgusting, and the captain realized he had lost and decided to give the cook a word of praise. Sometime later, Bailey managed to make the best dish he had made so far - the steaks tasted like real food, not the algae. After a small chat, Paul and Bailey both agreed that Winkelmann had significantly contributed to Bailey's success by criticizing his food and driving the cook more eager to prove himself. "

He also serves a fudge for dessert that is compounded from the dextrose-paste of the carbohydrate recycler. After speaking with Paul initially, Bailey serves a dish of hamburger steak again. There is an individual head of lettuce served, along with a steak drenched in gravy. Later, he serves them a hot turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce is very believable, whereas the turkey is white and tender even though it is made from Chlorella. When Captain Winkelmann pushes Bailey too far, he begins to create disgusting foods. One of the first dishes he serves is boiled Chlorella vulgaris that resembles vomit. The coffee at noon also tastes of salt. However, at the very end of the story, Bailey succeeds in making his Chlorella steak actually taste like food.",
            "The dishes Bailey cooks for the crew varies greatly, ranging from artificial vegetables to mock-meats. One dish that he makes is a mock-meat hamburger, with the pressed Chlorella tinted pink and seasoned by oregano and thyme. The dish is accompanied by dessert - a fudge made from dextrose-paste. More mock-meat dishes include a hamburger steak covered in a rich, meaty gravy lavishly seasoned with garlic. \n\nAnother dish includes a mock individual head of lettuce dressed with vinegar and oil. The lettuce was made by Bailey constructing each synthetic lettuce leaf, with the narrator guessing the process to be out of pressing, rolling and shaping a green Chlorella paste. \n\nIn contrast to some of the delicious dishes that Bailey makes, the Cook also delivers some less tasty meals in response to the Captain\u2019s critiques. These included boiled Chlorella vulgaris in some soup and subpar algaeburgers. \n\nBailey\u2019s final dish in the story - and the best one yet - is an artificial steak that greets the crew with a barbecue smell. It is drenched with gravy and seasoned with a peppery and garlicy taste, and as the crew eats it, they find that the usually pond-scum taste that accompanies each repurposed chlorella meal is gone and instead, the taste and texture reflects actual steak. \n",
            "Throughout their trip, Bailey does the best he can in order to replicate traditional food using the Algae. To impress the Captain, Bailey cooks a wide variety of foods including algae burgers, fudge, Steak with gravy and a head of lettuce, Hot turkey with cornbread and butter sauce, and medium rare steak. None of these foods impressed the Captain, so Bailey went back to cooking unappealing food such as a porridge-like broth and bad coffee. At the end, Bailey serves a new type of steak, which is hinted to be human steak from the Captain.",
            "Bailey made a lot of different dishes while working on the Sale ship. He cooked a hamburger and a fudge. He made a steak with rich meat gravy and lettuce, vinegar, and oil. An ersatz hot turkey supreme with a cheese sauce, cornbread, and a pottage was also served at some point. All of these were criticized by Captain Winkelmann. Mostly Bailey was working on the taste of steak, which at the end of the story, he managed to perfect to a certain extent, partly thanks to the captain\u2019s constant remarks. "

He is creative and experimental, choosing to use the necessary chlorella algae off-cuts and recycled pastes of the ship in inventive ways to come up with mock-meats, vegetables, and even desserts.

            "The Chlorella algae is what keeps all of the crew members alive for the duration of the journey. Since twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the compartment to bursting, Chlorella algae is the solution to this. It can work over used food, air, and effluvia, three tons of metabolites that would see them through the entire round trip. Everything the crew recycles is fed to the algae, which feeds the crew members in return. The waste is used to fertilize the liquid fields. Even their stubble from 2,600 shaves and clipping from 666 haircuts is used to feed the algae because human hair is rich in essential amino acids. The algae is their food, as well as the water and air that keeps the crew members going. ",
            "The chlorella algae is integral to the story as well as the shipmen. On each ship, a colony of chlorella algae is introduced in order to recycle through the used air, water and other effluvia that the crewmates both used and wasted. Everything that couldn\u2019t feed the crew like molecules of fat, minerals, carbohydrates etc were used to feed the algae, and in return, the Cook would use the algae offcuts and pastes to feed the crew. It served its purpose both as the key sustenance for the crewmates as well as an important part of the recycling process aboard the ship. \n\nThroughout the story, it also serves as an important piece of the Cook overcoming the challenge of working with algae. In every dish, despite his creativity and seasonings, the taste and look of algae - tasting like pond-scum and green - will be present in some way. By the end of the story, however, the Cook has been able to tenderize and shape the algae\u2019s texture in such a way that it mimics real meat. \n\n",
            "The Chlorella algae is what the cook uses to make his food. The algae works over the air that the crew doesn\u2019t use, and is also fed with waste from the ship, including hair and human waste as fertilizer. The algae was then cooked by the chef to feed the crew and create a cycle that allows the ship to do long voyages. The algae tastes very bad, and requires a lot of cooking effort to make it somewhat edible, which is what Bailey did. Bailey managed to replicate traditional dishes very well using the algae, but it wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the Captain. ",
            "Chlorella algae were important because they allowed the spaceship and its crew members to get to their destination without bringing tons of food and gear with them. It worked over the used air, the crew\u2019s water, other effluvia, and types of waste; and extracted different proteins, minerals, and fat from it, feeding itself. And the algae, on the other hand, served as the main food ingredient for the spacers that spent months on a spaceship. The algae - served in different ways and with various dressings - were practically the main dish every day. Water and oxygen were recycled, too.\n"

Suddenly, the door knocks, and a man named Mr. Oyster comes in. Despite having never met before, he is impressed that Simon knows him and asks the other man if he believes in time travel. Betty says it is impossible, and Mr. Oyster questions her about why. Simon then asks why he came, to which the potential client responds that he wants them to hunt up some time travelers. He asks Betty some more about science fiction and explains that he is willing to gamble his fortune to investigate the presence of time travelers in the current era. Mr. Oyster further says that these time travelers will be at the Oktoberfest in Munich, which is considered the greatest festival globally. Simon says that he is not interested in taking up the case. Betty is surprised, and Mr. Oyster tries to offer him a substantial amount of money. Simon then tells them a story where he accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s offer. Simon thinks about how much fun he will have and a fake report to generate for Mr. Oyster. He then goes on to be suspicious about how five million people can appear to attend a festival in a remote part of southern Germany, especially considering the population of Munich is less than one million. There is no hotel space in Munch, so Simon must go to Bahnhof to apply for hotel service. It is suspicious how the five million attendees are accommodated for this festival. The circus-like tents represent the seven major brewers of the Munich area, and many people are going around. Simon finds a space at one of the tables; he notes that the crowd is made up of both tourists and Germans. A bald-headed person and he both drink beer. The bald man accidentally reveals that his pencil is Venusian and tells Simon that his dream is to sample each of the seven best beer brands. The man then introduces himself as Arth and tells Simon that he is from a strange location. Arth offers to take him to his hotel later, and Simon goes with him. Arth gives him a box of pills for his hangover, and the scene cuts to them drinking at the festival again. Simon feels that something is off and decides to go back to New York. He returns to the office, where Mr. Oyster tells him that Betty has just finished the receipt. They are both confused and say that he has only been gone for about three minutes. Mr. Oyster is furious and leaves, while Betty asks why he didn\u2019t just take the money.

While Mr. Oyster is confused about why Simon rejects such a large amount of money and a chance to go on a vacation, Simon tells him a story.\n\nIn the story, Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and goes to Oktoberfest. When he gets to Munich, he cannot find a hotel to stay in since there are too many people to be accommodated. While drinking in the big tent held by the local brewery, Simon meets a guy who wants to try all the beer. He then accompanies him to drink.

While they talk in the guy\u2019s place, the guy carelessly leaks information about where he comes from, which seems like a time traveler. On the following day, when the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he tells Simon not to move and goes into the bathroom. After he comes out, he gives Simon a pill and lets him go.

Identifying the old man by name - Mr. Oyster - he details his desire to investigate time travel. Insisting that time travel is possible and real, with all the paradoxes explained away, Mr. Oyster passionately hypothesizes that time travelers often congregate at events like Oktoberfest and propose for Simon and Betty to attend the festival and nab a time traveler. Simon expands on the latter\u2019s desire as to him wanting the investigators to exhort from the time traveler some secret of eternal youth, and hence be willing to pay a premium rate of upwards of fifty thousand dollars. Despite this generous amount, Simon declines, and instead tells the pair a story. \n\nThe story goes: he took a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster as an advance and departed on the first flight out to Germany. When he arrived at the festival, Simon found an available space in a brewers tent. He sat down across a bald-headed man who appeared to be noting down the various beers being tried. Introducing himself as Arth, Simon and Arth end up traversing the rest of the festival\u2019s breweries together, getting more and more inebriated with each one. After a while, both of them head back to Arth\u2019s hotel and pass out. The next morning, Arth is surprised to find Simon and gives him a pill to help with Simon\u2019s hangover. In the next scene, Simon finds them the next day back at the festival, nursing another mug of beer. With a terrible hangover and not remembering the details of the previous night, Simon says his goodbyes and heads to pick up his luggage, only to find it lost. He decided to head to the airport and fly out without it, found himself with a momentary bump with a ticketing error, and went directly to his office after landing. At the office, Simon is surprised to find Mr. Oyster there, surmising that he is eager to get the report. However, as Betty expresses that she just met Mr. Oyster that morning, he soon realizes that he somehow indeed time traveled. \n\nWhen Simon finished telling his story, Mr. Oyster is in disbelief and believes that he is being ridiculed and storms out of the office, leaving behind fifty dollars for the investigator's time. Betty comments that he is surprised he didn\u2019t take the offer. Simon reveals that he did, actually, three times. It turns out that Mr. Oyster\u2019s hypothesis on time travelers\u2019 existence and their congregation at Oktoberfest was correct. However, these time travelers - like Arth - will immediately reset the track if the space-time continuum was threatened - like they did to Simon. Nursing several hangovers, Simon implores Betty to let it go.\n",

After the 3 of them go back and forth debating about the existence of time travel, Simon starts to tell a story about him going to Oktoberfest, and how an entanglement with a time traveler could go. The story starts with Simon arriving at the festival, and immediately becomes friends with a time traveler, Arth. After drinking together, they end up going to Arth\u2019s hotel. When Simon wakes up, he is in a very futuristic room. When Arth notices him, he gives him a pill and then Simon wakes up in the Oktoberfest again. Arth tells him it is the day after, but Simon ends up going back to New York. When he gets there, he arrives not 10 minutes later after he left. After the story ends, he rejects Mr. Oyster\u2019s proposal and it is revealed the story was real, and that Simon had in fact gone to the future with Arth, and had found time travelers. "

Since there are many people at Oktoberfest, it is perfect for strange people to blend in since nobody will notice. Oktoberfest is also mentioned to start on a Friday and continues for sixteen days. In Simon\u2019s story, the seven major brewers of the Munich area are all represented by circus-like tents. Each tent contains benches and tables that can seat up to five thousand people. There is a tremendous bandstand in the tent's center, where the musicians are lederhosen-clad. The music is described to be Bavarian as well.

            "Arth is a bald man at Oktoberfest. He is first introduced as a bald-headed drunk who sits across from Simon. They share a beer together and toast. After, Arth makes a note to write down the name engraved on his mug in a small notebook with a pencil. When Simon asks if he is German, Arth accidentally responds that his pencil is Venusian. Arth is very determined to fulfill his pilgrimage of trying every single beer at Oktoberfest, but he is disappointed that he will never make it. Simon asks him where he is from when they go to another tent, and Arth responds that he is from 2183 South St in New Albuquerque; it is situated right across Old Albuquerque. Arth also has a kind side to him, as he offers to take Simon to his hotel to rest for the night. He even offers Simon a box of pills to help with his hangover. When they go back to drinking again, he looks at Simon cautiously when the latter does not remember where he spent the night. Arth looks at Simon strangely as he goes back, even though he is initially portrayed as a friendly and kind bald man. ",
            "According to Simon's story, Arth is a time traveler that Simon meets in Oktoberfest. He is bald. He has a small notebook and a Venusian pencil in his pocket. He is from 2183 South Street, New Albuquerque. He is a vegetarian. He meets Simon, a detective who comes to Oktoberfest to search for time travelers, in a tent in Oktoberfest. He invites Simon to go to his place when he knows that Simon has no place to stay. He resets the time when he wakes up the following morning and realizes that he may leak information about his identity to Simon. He gives Simon a pill and sends him out after resetting the time.",
            "Arth is a fellow Oktoberfest go-er that Simon meets at one the brewery tents, who is on a pilgrimage to try every beer from the seven best brands, but has only made it so far as the Lowenbrau beer. He and Simon set off together as a pair to try the rest of the beers. In making conversation, we find out that Arth often slips in what he says. For example, when writing down the beers he is trying, Simon inquires about the odd type of pencil he is using and assumes it is German, but Arth corrects him and says that it is Venusian. As an afterthought, Arth says that he should not have said that. Similarly, when Simon asks where Arth is from, Arth simply says \u20182183\u2019 before correcting it to a supposed street address in New Albuquerque. \n\nAfter a couple more beers, Arth brings Simon back to his hotel room as Simon has yet to find one himself. The next morning, Arth expresses regret and stupidity towards himself for bringing Simon back and hands him a pill - supposedly aspirin - for Simon\u2019s hangover. The next day, as Simon continues nursing his hangover, Arth details the memories of last night cautiously to Simon and they end up saying their goodbyes. Overall, Arth appears to marvel at Oktoberfest in an odd way. He also seems to be cautious - oftentimes slipping up with revealing too much or a certain information and regrettably having to correct it. \n",
            "Arth is described as a bald man, who seems to be very drunk when Simon befriends him at the festival. Throughout the story, it becomes clearer and clearer that Arth is a time traveler. He said he is from 2183, probably referring to his year, as well as referring to his pen as being \u201cvenusian\u201d. Arth is on a pilgrimage to complete the 7 tents within the festival, as he wanted to experience the greatest festival ever. He ends up taking Simon to the future with him, but when he realizes his mistake sends Simon back to the present using a pill. "

He is perceptive as well, knowing who Mr. Oyster is without having seen him before and informative about time travel. However, he does show a stubborn side when he refuses Mr. Oyster\u2019s offer no matter how much money the other man offers him. Even though he could just create a false report for Mr. Oyster, he refuses to take the job. Simon later reveals to Betty that he has already experienced going to Oktoberfest three times and has brought nothing but multiple hangovers back. In the story he tells, Simon is very friendly towards Arth and tries to help him on his pilgrimage. He ends up getting extremely hungover and goes back to New York, which then resets the entire cycle of events again. ",
            "Simon is a detective who constantly searches for his aspirin bottle. He is weary and tired when Mr. Oyster comes to give a request on hunting a time traveler. He needs a vacation. In his story, he does not find a place to stay, so he leaves his bag in one of the hotels. After he goes into a tent to have some beers, he meets a time traveler in Oktoberfest without knowing the identity of the time traveler. He is invited to the time traveler\u2019s home, and the next day, he is sent out after taking a pill. After leaving the time traveler\u2019s house, he cannot find his bag in the hotel since there is no check receipt to show that his bag has been stored there. His flight ticket also has a weird, wrong date. When he gets back to the office, he realizes that he goes back to when he had just left to catch the flight. He tries to tell other people that he has the same experience as the story, but no one believes him.",
            "Simon, the protagonist, is an investigator alongside his assistant, Betty. He is recruited by Mr. Oyster to further investigate and locate a time traveler in Oktoberfest, and exhort a time traveler\u2019s secrets to eternal life in return for a generous sum. Initially described as someone looking to make money, it is surprising that he turns down the opportunity. \n\nHowever, it is revealed through the story that he did initially take the offer. Simon\u2019s disbelief at Mr. Oyster\u2019s insistence of time travelers is attributed as whilst on the plane, Simon plans to embellish and dream up the material in Mr. Oyster\u2019s report. However, he soon begins to have suspicions about the feasibility of such time travelers, as facts like the vast number of people attending Oktoberfest and cost of expenditure in contrast to the location and timing of the festival do not appear to make sense to Simon. \n\nSimon is also described as friendly and open, as he instantly makes conversation with Arth and makes casual conversation with him about his time at Oktoberfest, where he\u2019s from, etc. The two of them fall into an easy companionship and set off to try the rest of the beers together. He is also smart and pragmatic, choosing to cut his losses at Oktoberfest and head back home early. Whilst at the office in discovering that it was the same day as he had supposedly left for Oktoberfest, he demonstrates his intelligence in being able to suss out what had happened to him.  \n",

He also learns from his mistakes, as he already tried to find a time traveler, but he refuses to try again because of the situation that he suffered the first time. \n"

            "The story that Simon tells relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request about time travelers because he is the one who time traveled. Although he calls it a funny story, the sequence of events he describes is all actual events he experiences. The entire purpose of Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and his desire to spend a portion of his fortune is to find a time traveler and come to a conclusion that they exist. However, he fails to realize that the very person he is asking has time traveled. Since the events were repeated three times, Simon\u2019s refusal now changes the flow of events in the near future to avoid a fourth hangover. Even though Mr. Oyster leaves angrily, Simon\u2019s story serves as a true report of time traveling and fulfills Mr. Oyster\u2019s request. ",
            "Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request is to find the time traveler in the Oktoberfest in Munich and bring back the secret of eternal youth from them. On the other hand, Simon tells the story about what will happen after accepting the requests and going to Oktoberfest. Simon will not be able to find his accommodation in Munich as there will be too many people to be accommodated. Simon will meet a time traveler and have fun with him. Since they are both drunk, the time traveler will take Simon back to his place and leak some information about the future. On the following day, once the time traveler realizes what he did last night, he will reset the time to where Simon starts and send Simon back. When Simon is back, it will only be him remembering the whole thing. And if Simon tries to tell Mr. Oyster and his clerk about what happened, they will only consider him as ridiculing them since they do not believe the time has been reset. Therefore, the story Simon tells reveals that even if Simon accepts Mr. Oyster\u2019s request and meets a time traveler, he will not be able to bring back the secret of eternal youth but only a severe hangover because the space-time continuum track is not allowed to be changed.",
            "Simon\u2019s story relates back to Mr. Oyster\u2019s initial request to find time travelers because it confirms Mr. Oyster\u2019s theory: that time travelers exist and they do attend Oktoberfest. To us as readers, the meeting between Mr. Oyster and Simon and Betty in the beginning of the story marks the first time all three of them meet. However, Simon\u2019s story tells us the opposite, that it is actually the second or third time Simon has met Mr. Oyster and completed his request, each time nursing a hangover. \n\nWe find out through Simon that while Mr. Oyster was correct in his insistence at the existence of time travelers, he was wrong in thinking that time travelers would give up the secrets of eternal life and threaten the space-time continuum. In fact, we can see from the interactions between Simon and Arth that time travelers will do whatever it takes to reset the timeline and prevent the space-time continuum from being threatened. It is clear through Simon\u2019s repeat experiences with the same meeting, same day, and same hangover that Simon had investigated a little too closely to the time travelers, and as a consequence, returned back to his office on a reset day, with only his hangover and change from the initial thousand dollars as the only witness to the alternate reality. \n",
            "Simon\u2019s story begins simply as a story of a trip to Germany to the Oktoberfest. Simon recounts his story of how he met a friend, Arth. In the end, we realize that in fact Arth was a time traveler, and that when Simon went to Arth\u2019s hotel it was in fact the future. We learn that at the time of recounting the story to Mr. Oyster, Simon had already gone to the future with Arth. "

            "Mr. Humphrey Fownes has been pickpocketed eleven times despite the weather being good. This is because he is an uncommonly preoccupied individual and has constantly been thinking about the weather for the entire day. The first person who pickpockets him is a bogus postman who jostles him while pretending to read a postal card. The next person who pickpockets him is a pretty girl who collides with him. The next people are two men who pretend to be in a heated argument. Humphrey continuously thinks about the weather outside; this allows the police to maintain tight surveillance of him. Lanfierre is one of the people in the orange car and thinks about Humphrey Fownes being unique. He tells Lieutenant MacBride that Fownes\u2019 house sometimes shakes, which makes the other man frown. Lanfierre considers MacBride to be a barbarian because he is cynical and cannot appreciate the peculiar nature of Fownes. He goes on to tell him that the windows all close at the same time in the house. MacBride refuses to believe him and tells him to take a rest, but all of the windows close, and the house suddenly begins to shake. They continue to observe the man; Fownes goes into his house and begins to think about his dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway. The house begins to shake more, and he decides that repairs are a must. During his dinner, Mrs. Deshazaway explains how she will never marry again. The widow is a passionate woman, and she passionately tells him he forgot salt on his potatoes during the explanation of why they cannot marry because of the air. When she continues to refuse him, Fownes brings up the idea of leaving the dome city for freedom. She tells him that if they can leave, then she will let him call her by her first name. After the date, he goes to the library, where the old librarian tries to test him with old library cards. The story then cuts to a movement meeting, where the members discuss how the old society failed and the lack of a sound foreign policy. Fownes impatiently explains that he and his future wife must leave now, to which the leader explains that it is impossible because there is no sound foreign policy. When Fownes returns to the house, he finds MacBride in the doorway with dripping hair. MacBride yells that these are not optimum dome conditions, explaining that Lanfierre is in the upstairs bedroom. The entire dome air supply is going through his bedroom, and a strange black cloud appears. Fownes recognizes this as a Kansas twister and runs towards the next house for Mrs. Deshazaway. The dome glass has begun to fall, destroying the artificial sun and optimum temperature. ",
            "The story is set in a nameless domed city in the future: it has perfect temperature conditions, its citizens never leave the city's borders and must be conformists, i.e lack any signs of aberration. Mr. Humphrey Fownes is a rather eccentric citizen that caught the attention of the police lieutenants whose job is to maintain normality within the dome\u2019s society. Lanfierre, Dome\u2019s police lieutenant, has been following Fownes for months and is truly impressed by his queerness and eccentricity. \nAt the beginning, together with lieutenant MacBride he collects personal information about Fownes, his parameters, the content of his pockets, etc. While sitting in a car parked near Fownes\u2019 house, Lanfierre tells MacBride about the other strange things that he has witnessed while studying Fownes\u2019 life, for example, that his house is shaking occasionally or that his windows always close at the same moment. MacBride is skeptical but unexpectedly all the windows actually slam shut in one second and the walls start wobbling. At the same time, Fownes is inside the house: after closing the windows he goes down to his closet mechanism that creates an illusion of a sunset with flowers, then adding the rain and wind - the things he believed ancients had. Using that mechanism, he wants to seduce Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow whose four ex-husbands died. During their supper, she states that she won\u2019t marry Mr.Fownes but hints at changing her mind if he gets them both outside the dome. Later, he goes to a library meeting of people that criticize the existence of the dome but they cannot provide Fownes with any useful information regarding leaving the city and going outside. \n\nWhile Fownes is away, the police lieutenants decide to enter his house, and  Lanfierre out of curiosity turns the wheel that switches the closet mechanism and opens the valve of the bootleg pipe connected to the dome air system. Walking back, Fownes sees his house shaking. Desperate, MacBride and Lanfierre ask him if they can stop the wind but Humphrey realizes that there is nothing they can do to stop the entire dome air supply from coming through his room. The wind blows off the roof and creates a twister. MacBride orders Humphrey to stop everything immediately, but Fownes leaves the shocked police and runs happily to Mrs. Deshazaway, screaming and asking for her hand, hoping the twister will get them to the outside world, just like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n",
            "The story follows an eccentric man named Humphrey Fownes that lives inside of a domed city. As Fownes is walking around the neighborhood, it is revealed that he is being tracked by the police for his eccentric nature. The police sent undercover people to pickpocket him and steal anything they could find in his pockets. After this walk and while the police wait outside his car, it is revealed that Fownes built a machine that creates different environments inside his house. Fownes then meets with his neighbor and it is said that he is in love with her, and the environments created in his house are meant to replicate romantic scenarios and get her to marry him. After she says that she will only marry Fownes if they leave the dome together, he goes to the library to find ways to escape the dome. There, he meets with members of the Movement, a group of people that got together in order to protest the reality in which they lived. Here he finds an old book jacket of The Wizard of Oz, which had a twister on the front. After going home, he finds that his house is shaking and his machine is creating a storm of water and wind. He realizes that in his absence the police had entered and broken his machines. After rescuing the two policemen, the storm gets worse and worse and eventually turns into a twister. Fownes realizes that the twister is destroying the dome and eagerly calls to his neighbor to join him in following the twister outside the dome. ",
            "Humphrey Fownes has been pick-pocketed by the police disguised as the ordinary. He does not notice all the intended bumping because he is weirdly preoccupied with the question of the always optimum weather in the dome. The police target him because his house often shakes heavily, and he is considered a weird person. \n\nHis house shakes because he connects pipes between the dome blower system and his cellar, letting the winds build up in his house, which causes the dancing of the house. He never notices the phenomenon of his home because it always happens when he is in the place and preoccupied with his plan of getting Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow, to marry him. He builds all this mechanism to create an illusion of imaginary ancient romance, hoping to get a slight chance to let Mrs. Deshazaway nod her head. But he constantly fails because she is so scared that the fifth man will die in the marriage with her. Nonetheless, when Humphrey tells her his plan of leaving the dome, she promises him that she will marry him if they can go and live somewhere else with fresher air.\n\nHumphrey goes to the Movement, an organization that wants to protest the lack of a sound foreign policy in the dome. This organization informs members of the goodness of living in the Open Country. Humphrey tries to know how to leave the dome through the Movement, but the leader disappoints him. When he returns home, he sees his house shaking. The two officials are in his place, and one of them turns on the wheel in the bedroom, which leads to the constant winds blowing from the blower system. The winds build up to a certain point that it becomes a twister, which eventually breaks the dome apart. Humphrey\u2019s dream has come true. He runs away to find Mrs. Deshazaway because he can finally marry her.\n"

Although the weather is generally cloudless, there are light showers that make small geysers of shiny mist. His house is also noted to be located right next to Mrs. Deshazaway\u2019s house. Inside of an orange car, Lanfierre and MacBride watch him. Fownes\u2019 house has a porch and a bootleg pipe connected into the dome blower system. His downstairs closet contains the Master Mechanism. The illusion he sees is of a red sun setting brightly, marred by an occasional arcover that leaves the scent of ozone. There is a garden outside as well, and a gigantic moon hidden in a large area of the sky. Neon large roses are found in the garden, and their colors change from red to violet. Inside of his bedroom closet upstairs, there is a rainmaker. The outside world that Fownes describes to Mrs. Deshazaway, outside of the dome, is one with miles and miles of space. The real-estate monopoly has no control, and the windows blow across prairies. When Fownes goes to the library, the place is described as a shattered and depressing place. It is used very infrequently, filled with given over government publications and censored old books with holes in them.

He leaves for dinner with Mrs. Deshazaway, a widow with a bad reputation - Humphrey created the mechanism to seduce and marry her. Later, he goes to a meeting of some nonconformists in a library where they talk about the prehistory of the domed society. Walking back, he notices that his building is shaking and soon learns that while he was away the police decided to search his house and one of them switched on the mechanism letting all the dome air supply go through his bedroom. Realizing that nothing can be done and seeing his roof fly off, Humphrey runs to Mrs. Deshazaway, hoping that the appearing twister will take them outside the dome, to some unique new world, like it did in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. \n\n",

The city is also inside of a large, glass dome that has robots that constantly fix it as pieces of class constantly fall onto the city below. Fownes\u2019 home is located on a very quiet and residential street, but his house was everything but that. His home is described as an old and large house, with a machine that can change the environment of the house and constantly makes it shake. Part of the story also takes place in a library, which is old and unkempt. ",
            "People live in the dome where the weather is always optimum, with 59 degrees and 47% humidity. Everyone who lives in the dome must be normal and not act weird. Otherwise, the officials will inspect the queerness and conduct some necessary actions to protect the normality in the dome. A sound foreign policy cannot be formed before, resulting in a confined dome society with no foreign policy. The dome citizens cannot go outside of the dome due to the lack of a sound foreign policy."

He wants to use this mechanism to make Mrs. Deshazaway, a passionate widow living next door, fall in love with him and get married. At the end of the story, when the police officer unknowingly switches the mechanism, making the wind and water work in the full-power mode, which soon makes the wind currents uncontrollable, this mechanism destroys Fownes\u2019 roof and creates a twister that jeopardizes the infrastructure of the entire city and the dome\u2019s integrity.

So whenever he turns on the wheel in the bedroom upstairs, the winds will blow through the pipes towards the downstairs closet, building up the air pressure in the room.

Once Alan returns to the site, he observes the killer robots and praises Pete for getting them to work. However, when the robots turn on him, he realizes that the robots must have been programmed to pick up human brain waves.

As the robot comes towards him again, he understands what it means to live and forces himself to keep walking. Alan then hugs the bank as pure electricity arches over him, sliding slowly and away from the machine above. The robot trembles and suddenly falls; this gives Alan an opportunity to tackle it. The two struggle, but Alan takes a hunting knife out and jams it into the robot. He wonders how Pete managed to create these robots so perfectly.

Remembering his wife Peggy and everyone else who was going to land on the next day, Alan decides to at least try to fight the robots and prevent them from killing everybody on this approaching ship. He runs through the jungle, bruising his arms and legs, getting bitten by insects, and manages to temporarily disable the robot by half-drowning him in the river and stabbing his metal corpus with a knife. When he hears the other robots approaching the river he realizes that they must be connected by radio and, thus, are controlled by the main computer in the camp\u2019s headquarters.

            "On a seemingly normal flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles sits our protagonist, on his way to complete a printing order. In his initial musings, we find out that his curiosity and intuition about his fellow passengers come out of his extrasensory ability to see inside objects and human beings. The protagonist is also revealed to be able to manipulate time by stopping clocks, which he uses to his benefit with early wake-up calls. Despite his unique abilities, he laments that it renders largely useless and mundane as it often ruins surprises like Christmas gifts, requires a bit of guessing, and fails to work as gimmicks in manipulating games like Vegas slot machines. \n\nAnd so with his seemingly useless but curious gaze, the protagonist ponders about his seat-mate\u2019s purse, Amos Magaffey the purchasing agent, and rifling through luggages and identifying his own. All of sudden, his musings are halted by the discovery of a bomb in one of the luggages, with a countdown timer ticking with 10 minutes or less. The flight is still 40 minutes away from its destination and so with great effort and increasing suspicion from his seat-mate, the protagonist uses his ability to stop the ticking bomb. The flight lands safely with the bomb remaining inactivated, but the protgaonist now worries between alerting authorities - which may cast suspicion upon himself - or follow the luggage and identify who picks it up. With no one initially picking up the luggage with the bomb - the little red bag - it is delivered by the flight attendant to the rear room. Soon, a young lady arrives to pick it up. It is then that the protagonist hurries over to her in hopes of warning her of the ticking time bomb. It turns out that the likely culprit of planting the bomb is the young lady\u2019s - Julia Claremont - husband, whose motives are unknown but nevertheless unhinged. Armed with this information and a false story about the bag\u2019s suspicion, the pair decides to approach an airport policeman and inform them of the bomb. However, as they return to where they left their bags, they find that both his and Julia\u2019s luggages have been stolen by a strange man entering his grey vehicle. Turning to the airport policeman in reporting this stolen luggage, they are interrupted by an explosion in a grey vehicle. Shocked and somber, Julia and the protagonist inform the policeman that they no longer wish to report the stolen luggage, and the two begin to walk away from the airport. \n",
            "The protagonist and narrator of the story is a man who long ago discovered that he had an extraordinary ability: sensing the contents of different objects, like boxes and bags, and moving light things, like feathers or a watch balance wheel, without touching them. He got in trouble for naively using his gift in the fourth grade and has kept quiet about it ever since. At the beginning of the story, he is on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles for a business meeting with an amusement chain owner. After studying the passengers around him, checking the window view, and mentally looking through the purse of a woman next to him, he decides to find his suitcase in the luggage compartment of the plane. The narrator is going through the content of other people\u2019s suitcases when he feels something resembling a bomb. It seems to be inside a small woman\u2019s bag and is about to go off in ten minutes, but the plane is supposed to land only in forty. Anxious and hectic, he refuses the cup of coffee from a stewardess and decides that he has to stop the clock mechanism, at least for the duration of the flight. He does it every morning with his alarm, so it doesn\u2019t seem impossible. After temporarily stopping it, his thoughts race ahead to the landing, realizing that he wouldn\u2019t be able to control the mechanism forever or tell the truth to the police. But his thinking process is disturbed by turbulence - he realizes that the balance wheel is moving again. After some tugging, pulling, and shoving, it finally becomes immovable. When the plane lands, the protagonist goes to the baggage claim and tries to find the owner of the bag. After picking up his suitcase and watching how the claim employees take the bag with the bomb to the storage room, he finally sees a blond woman called Julia Claremont - he saw her on the flight - approaching the counter. He convinces her to put the bag down and pretends that he is speaking to someone in a telephone booth while deactivating the mechanism once again. When she asks for an explanation, he invites her to an airport coffee shop and tells her everything. At the end of his monologue, she starts crying and says that her husband Joe probably put it in her bag after she had finished packing the day before. That trip was Joe\u2019s idea, but she doesn\u2019t know why her husband would do something like that. They go back to the gate to realize that the bags they had left there are gone. The protagonist sees the thief throw their bags into his car\u2019s rear seat and rapidly drive off. When they are ready to go to the police office to file a report, a loud explosion occurs somewhere near the airport. Julia and the narrator don\u2019t report luggage theft and walk away. \n\n\n",
            "The protagonist finishes reading the Chronicle an hour into his flight when he sees a sea of clouds where the San Joaquin Valley should be. He observes a few passengers and sees a familiar blonde from the gate. He thinks about the printing order in Los Angeles and begins exploring the old lady\u2019s purse next to them. The protagonist's powers allow him to explore the inside of anything, but he remarks that it is not any fun because all he does is feel the shapes and guess. He goes through the lady\u2019s belongings and becomes disappointed when nothing is of interest. The scene cuts to the fourth-grade protagonist eating lunch with Miss Winters for a minor infraction. Miss Winters leaves for a moment and tells the protagonist to erase the blackboard. She cannot find her favorite mechanical pencil when she comes back, and the protagonist probes her purse to find it. He generally keeps quiet about their special gift but can move certain objects. The old lady wakes up again, and the protagonist begins to think about securing a printing deal with Amos Magaffey. He probes through belongings and finds a bomb in a woman\u2019s bag. He begins to panic and thinks about what to do when a stewardess offers him a tray full of food; the protagonist cannot bring himself to accept it. The lady next to him is concerned, but he insists that he is okay and asks for a cup of coffee. The protagonist has temporarily stopped the timer, and he thinks about what will happen once the luggage begins to move because the timer will start again. As he concentrates, the old woman notices again and asks if he is sleeping. Once the plane stops, the protagonist leaves and observes the baggage being transported from the plane to find the bag with the bomb. Once the protagonist claims his baggage, he waits to see who will claim the bag with the bomb. Although he should be meeting with Amos Magaffey, he knows that he will be unable to live with himself if he lets the bomb explode. The blonde from earlier appears to claim her bag, and the protagonist stops her by saying that he has something important to tell her. He manages to stop the bomb timer again by pretending to dial a number in the telephone booth. He and the woman then go grab a coffee, where he explains the situation; she is horrified to realize that her husband Joe is the one who put the bomb in. She introduces herself as Julia Claremont, and the both of them pay the tab to leave. They realize that their bags are stolen by the dumpy man from earlier in the lobby. The redcap tells them to tell the policeman, while a loud explosion suddenly happens. The two of them decide to forego their luggage because of the bomb and walk down the street arm in arm. ",
            "A man with extrasensory ability finds a bomb on the plane. He doesn\u2019t want to tell the stewardess that there is a bomb because he cannot explain how he knows it without exposing his ability. His unwillingness to reveal his ability also originates from his childhood memory that his teacher doubts him as a thief when he tells her where her pencil is. During the whole flight, he uses his ability to move the wheel in the bomb not to let it count down to explosion. \n\nAfter the plane lands, he goes to pick up his baggage. When he grabs his bag, he also sees the one with a bomb in the baggage claim area in the airport. He waits and hesitates to tell the truth to the airport officer. When he sees the baggage claim attendant trying to move the bag with the bomb to the rear room in the airport, he almost tells the truth, but he sees a woman come and try to find her bag. After the woman takes the bag, he approaches the woman, tells her to put the bag away, and goes to grab a coffee with her. He explains everything to her, including his extrasensory ability. The woman is startled. When they decide to tell the police to deactivate the bomb and walk out of the coffee shop, they see a thief grab both of their baggage and drive away. The police come and try to help them, but they all hear a massive explosion sound. They tell the police not to report the property stolen, and they leave.\n"

Flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles to visit her sister on her husband\u2019s suggestion, she is the first person that the protagonist reveals his extrasensory abilities to. Despite the extraordinary tale, Claremont believes him and reveals herself that the likely culprit of the bomb to be her husband. Under the guise of putting in books for her sister to read, she surmises that her husband likely used that opportunity to plant the bomb. However, she is unable to identify the motives of her husband or more likely, she would rather not to. \n\nDespite this shock, Claremont and the protagonist devise a somewhat likely story to alert the airport policeman of her suspicious of a bomb in her luggage in order to quickly deactivate it as well as divert attention from how the protgaonist was able to sense it. On their way over to where they left their bags, they noticed them to be stolen and identified a dumpy man as the thief, heading over to his grey vehicle to take off with them. As they approach an airport policeman to report this theft instead, they are interrupted by an explosion - the bomb having gone off. Seemingly on the same page, Claremont turns to the policeman as she retracts her desire to report the theft - with the protagonist doing the same - and turns to walk away, leaving the mayhem of the explosion at the airport behind them. \n",

After picking up her bag, the narrator convinces her to put it down and, after some time, invites Julia to a cafe. He tells her about his gift and that there is a bomb in her bag. She cries and realizes that after she had finished packing, her husband said he would put some books in her bag as a gift to the sister. She understands that he must\u2019ve put the bomb in her luggage, but she doesn\u2019t know why. They walk back to the airport lobby and see that their suitcases got stolen.

            "The protagonist finds out about his extraordinary ability at an early age and quickly finds out that it is better to keep this information to himself. One incident that drove this message home occured in the fourth grade with his teacher, Miss Winters. At the time, the protagonist was sentenced to eat lunch with her as a minor punishment. After the lunch period was over, Miss Winters found herself looking for her favorite mechanical pencil, asking the class if anyone had seen it while casting a suspicious eye at the protagonist. Aiming to maintain his innocence and help out his teacher, the protagonist used his ability to find the pencil - in Miss Winters\u2019 purse all along - and let her know. Instead, he was rewarded with a note sent home. \n\nEver since then, he found it to be safer to keep his ability a secret. Despite his curiosities about other potential extraordinary individuals, he recognizes that revealing any information gained from his ability would only cast suspicion upon himself from the authorities. For example, had the protagonist immediately alerted a flight attendant or the authorities about a bomb in one of the luggages the moment he discovered it on the plane, intrusive questions about how he knew or suspicions about him being the one to plant it were highly likely to arise. \n",
            "After using his gift in primary school and getting a stinging note for that, the protagonist decides to keep quiet about his ability. Even when he has to deal with a bomb he is still reluctant to share his secret because he thinks that his life would change forever and people would never trust him again since he would be considered a prying man. He doesn\u2019t believe that his gift can be used for anything meaningful, and ruining his life by revealing his ability definitely doesn\u2019t seem sensible to him. \n\n",

He has learned to keep quiet about it in the past because it will only cast disbelief on him. The incident with his fourth-grade teacher\u2019s mechanical pencil only made it seem like he had purposely hidden it in her purse. He has also thought about making money with the ability before, but it is not very useful because he can only feel around objects and guess what they are. Even though the protagonist feels panicked about the bomb, he knows that he cannot outright report it because nobody is aware of his ability. If he does, they will only cast suspicion on him for being the one who initially put it in there. Even when he thinks about calling ahead and convincing the authorities that he can stop the clock, there is no use.

            "This story has two settings: first, on an airplane from San Francisco to Los Angeles and second, at the Los Angeles airport in the baggage claim and arrivals terminal. The first setting - on the airplane mid flight - is highly important to the story because it is here that the protagonist discovered the bomb in the luggage. Not only that, he discovers that bomb is on a countdown with 10 minutes remaining before detonation while the flight still has 40 minutes before arrival. It is due to this fact that the protagonist utilizes his time manipulation ability to stop the clock successfully. \n\nIn the second setting, the tensions in this story continue to rise. Despite the protagonist successfully stopping the clock in the air, it appears to continue on the ground. With both the anticipation of watching to see who picks up the little red bag and dodging suspicions from the airport policeman and workers, we can imagine the hectic and panicked energy that sometimes appears in baggage claims. Additionally, an airport is filled with many people arriving and departing, which adds to the pressure the protagonist is facing in dealing with deactivating the bomb before anyone gets hurt. \n",
            "The first part of the story is happening on a plane that is flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles. When the protagonist finds the bomb in one of the bags in the luggage compartment, the plane is somewhere above the mountain range north of Los Angeles - even in theory, it is impossible to land because there are no airports around this area. He stops the clock mechanism, using his extraordinary ability. After the landing, the story continues in the building of the airport, where the protagonist finds the owner of the bag with the bomb - Julia Claremont. He tells her about the bomb and how he sensed it during the flight. She cries and tells him that her husband put it in her bag after she had finished packing. They go back to the lobby and see that their suitcases got stolen. The protagonist tries to chase the thief, but the man quickly drives off with the bags. When they decide to file a report, something explodes loudly near the airport, and Julia, together with the protagonist, walks away, refusing to report the theft. \n",
            "The story first begins on a plane from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The protagonist first expects to see San Joaquin Valley, but he is greeted by a sea of clouds instead. He sits next to an old woman on the plane. A little north of Bakersfield, he finds that one of the bags on the plane contains a bomb. It is forty minutes from Burbank to Lockheed Air Terminal, and there would be no place to land the plane any time soon. Once the protagonist gets off the plane, he heads to the baggage claim at the airport for his bag. When Julia gets her bag, he leads her to a telephone booth to make the fake call. Then, they leave their bags in the lobby and go to a coffee shop. The airport policeman is across the street from the parking lot. The setting of the plane is important because it is where the protagonist first discovers the bomb. Without his extraordinary ability to feel around any enclosed object, he would not be able to detect and temporarily stop the bomb\u2019s timer before it was too late. This is also significant because the plane would have exploded had he not found it. The airport is important too because that is where he meets Julia. He would not have figured out who the bag belonged to and the entire story without waiting at the airport. ",
            "The story's setting is in an ordinary world where no extrasensory ability is found or known. This setting is essential because the protagonist has the extrasensory ability, which allows him to see the insides of things and move some very light objects with his mind. However, since the world does not know the existence of the ability, he cannot tell anyone about it because if he tells people the truth, people either do not believe him or see him as a freak. Furthermore, since he cannot tell anyone his ability, neither can he tell people about what he finds in any bags, like a bomb, because he cannot explain how he knows what is inside of things that do not belong to him. Therefore, this inability to reveal his extrasensory ability drives the story to progress."

            "The protagonist\u2019s relationship with authority figures - like the airport policeman in this story - is a double edged sword. On one hand, it is figures like the policeman who are the right figure to report his suspicions towards. They are the ones equipped with the knowledge and resources on how to deal with the bomb in the little red bag. More importantly, informing them is the right thing to do and would save the lives of everyone else at the airport. On the other hand, however, we can see that the protagonist has revealed that authority figures in the past often choose to cast suspicion upon him rather than appreciate the usefulness of the knowledge that comes about his ability. If the protagonist were to approach the policeman in a suspicious manner or reveal too much information about his know-how of the bomb, it is likely that they will suspect him to be the culprit and probe him on something he is unable to explain, and hence arrest him. The protagonist has to carefully consider the implications of either decision and try to optimize both the safety of others around him and his own. \n\nThe protagonist chooses to inform the policeman of a suspicious baggage situation through the luggage\u2019s owner, Julia Clarmeont, which would deflect any suspicion on himself. However, the bomb detonates before they are able to follow through with it. \n",
            "Throughout the entire story, the protagonist tries to avoid any interaction with the police because he is afraid that they will either consider him the bomber or force him to reveal his ability, thus, changing his life for the worse. Even when Julia and the protagonist were ready to file a theft report, he quickly left after hearing the explosion. Possibly, he thought that he would be under suspicion and wasn\u2019t sure that the police would believe the real story even after he revealed his secret. ",
            "The protagonist and the authority figures share a fairly neutral relationship. On the plane, he first speaks to the stewardess by rejecting her food offer. The stewardess also later brings him a cup of coffee and takes the crushed cup away. At the baggage claim, the attendant continues to stare at the protagonist as he stares back. He is bored of his job and confused why the protagonist would ask about bags that are not claimed. He wants to tell the airport policeman that there is a bomb in one of the luggage, but he does not because he sees the clerk begin to move the unclaimed piece of luggage inside. The policeman remains unaware of the bomb. Later, when he and Julia speak to the policeman about a stolen bag, the policeman is sympathetic. As the bomb goes off, the policeman tells them that he cannot make them report the stolen bags after the two of them do not want their pieces of luggage anymore. ",
            "The protagonist holds the worry about the explosion of the bomb, but he cannot tell the airport authority about it because he cannot explain how he knows it. Meanwhile, the airport authority works as they usually do without knowing the bomb's existence. They can see the protagonist constantly hovering around the place and looking worrisome and anxious. Still, the only thought they have is probably to regard the protagonist as a strange person that needs help. When the protagonist\u2019s baggage is stolen, the policeman comes and asks if he needs help. After hearing the explosive sound, the protagonist tells the policeman he does not want to report the case. The policeman allows him to do so."

            "The story starts off with the main character, Rikud, watching space from a viewport that is located on what seems to be a spaceship. Rikud is part of a group of men that live on the spaceship under a strict set of unspoken rules. Rikud then connects with other characters named Chuls and Crifer while getting a bath of health-rays, an example of the high technology in the ship. After the stars in the viewport start changing, Rikud doubts the way of living that the men have taken. He starts to doubt the fact that they have a set span of years, and that they have to live separately from the women (even though he doesn't know what women are). When the view of the viewport changes to \u201cgardens\u201d, Rikud begins to question more and more, and ends up finding the machine room for the ship, as well as a control center that has another viewport. Unsuccessfully convincing the others to go outside with him, Rikud becomes enraged and breaks the machine room of the ship. After realizing that Rikud has messed up the buzzers that control the actions of the people, they begin to hurt Rikud and chase him through the ship. Rikud ends up opening the door that leads outside from the control room, and they discover a new world where they can live freely with the women. \n",
            "Rikud has come to watch the great changeless sweep of space for a week. The steady whining of the world that he has heard for all twenty-five years of his life have grown. Space looks different to him today because the stars are not as bright, and there is more darkness except for one very bright star that has set itself apart. Old Chuls approaches him and chides him for staring at stars when he is almost ready to foster children in five years. Rikud is nervous because no other man has these thoughts about who the Calculator will select as their mate. Chuls says that it is time for his bath in the health-rays, and Rikud goes with him. When they get to the health-ray area, Rikud feels the urge to see the stars again. The machine tells him fifteen minutes under the tub. Crifer, who is in the tube on his left, brings satisfaction to Rikud through his lame foot because it is proof that the world is not perfect. Crifer tells Rikud that he has been reading about astronomy lately in the library and stars. When Rikud tells him that the stars are changing, Crifer offers that variability may contribute. He later goes to see the stars again, observing how they make his eyes hurt and are paler than before. Rikud then sees a new shape appear in the form of a big sphere. He tries to get Chuls to see it too when the old man tells him it is time to eat, but Chuls sees and hears nothing. After a while, Rikud becomes fascinated with the gardens in the viewport. The view does not change for an entire week, and Crifer also agrees that the view looks like a garden. When he brings the conversation back to the stars appearing and disappearing, Crifer once again brings up variable. Rikud believes he has a bigger purpose in life; he decides to investigate the door at the back of the library while Crifer reads another book on astronomy. He sees another door that explains how this ship is a self-sustaining world, but Rikud cannot understand the words. He then has a traumatizing experience about going out to the garden because it is completely foreign to him. Three or four days later, Rikud feels comfortable enough to tell Crifer about what happened. He tries to convince Chuls too and grabs his blouse. Others in the crowd copy Rikud grabbing Chul\u2019s blouse, but a buzzer goes off and it is time for them to retire. Rikud then decides to break the buzzer, and everybody hates him. Nobody wants to go out with him, and they all decide to begin attacking him for breaking the buzzer. He tries to escape them, and all of them end up going into the garden. The story cuts to them realizing how beautiful it is outside, and the women begin to appear from the ship as well. ",
            "This story follows Rikud who lives aboard a ship that is self-sustaining and separated by men and women. He first encounters a unique feeling when he looks through the viewport and notices that the space around him has changed. The stars in particular, previously speckled and scattered, have now been replaced by a singular bright star. \n\nWhile undergoing his bath in the health rays, Rikud laments his life on the ship. Noting the lack of authority - the closest being the automated buzzer - he ponders the perfectness of life around him and realizes he is assured by Crifer\u2019s limp because it demonstrated that not everything was perfect. When talking to him, Crifer reveals that he has begun reading again in lieu of the normal evening activity of chatting to other ship passengers. In return, Rikud reveals that the stars in the viewport are changing and Crifer suggests that it may be due to variability - a concept newly introduced in his book on astronomy. While Rikud and Crifer contemplate the meaning of variability and the connection between the concepts, Chuls interrupts by denouncing variability as a contradictory term. Once the buzzer sounds again, they all continue with their daily routine. \n\nAs Rikud looks again at the star, he finds that the landscape has changed to reveal a sphere with brown and green, just like the garden aboard the ship. Despite the hesitant acknowledgment and adamant denial from Crifer and Chuls respectively, they are unable to explain why the garden is in the viewpoint. Continuing with his exploration, Rikud enters through a set of doors no man has gone through. As he enters through each door, he receives warnings from the buzzer and encounters stranger noises. By the time he attempts to reach the third, Rikud is overwhelmed with a sense of fear and runs back. In explaining his discovery, Rikud begins to hold Chul\u2019s blouse and sets off a chain of reactions with the other men as they begin to mimic his unfamiliar but exciting activity. However, once the buzzer sounds again, the men forget their behavior. Frustrated with the buzzing, Rikud finds a metal rod and smashes all the machinery on board - destroying the buzzer and the machines that provided the ship with light, food, and water. Disrupted by their routine and lifeline to the buzzer, Crifer and the other men begin to riot against Rikud, chasing and beating him. In running away from them, Rikud finds himself at the third door and while uncertain about the potential of life beyond the door, he chooses to open it to reveal the garden and the blue-white globe. \n\nThrough the door reveals fresh air, plants, and running water. Rikud and the others step out and bask in this strange but comforting new landscape, and as the women on the ship stepped off as well, Rikud noted a sense of contentedness in a world away from the buzzer and the machines.\n",
            "The story talks about a distant future where people left Earth long ago and now are living on a spaceship that is traveling through space. The ship is divided into two parts: male and female. People of two different sexes meet when they turn 30 after the so-called calculator defines their future partner.  Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity. They do not understand the concepts of change, world, space, authority, just living with the same schedule. They do not understand sickness since now they can take a bath in the health rays that provide them with immunity. \n\nRikud is a 25-year-old inhabitant who enjoys looking at the viewport that shows the changing stars. Sometimes he chats with Chuls, a 90-year-old fellow inhabitant of the ship, who doesn't show any traits of nonconformity and is satisfied with his regulated schedule. We meet him at the very beginning when he joins Rikud who stands near the viewport gazing at the stars. Together they go to the health rays\u2019 room. While waiting for the procedure to be over, Rikud thinks about different arbitrary notions, like authority, history, human will. In the same room lies Crifer, another inhabitant of the ship. He\u2019s short and has a lame foot which reminds Rikud of the world\u2019s imperfection. Crifer says that he found an interesting book about astronomy during his visit to the reading room. Rikud says that stars may be changing and Crifer claims that the book mentioned their variability, Chuls protests but their conversation ends quickly. Later, Rikud, during his visits to the viewport,  witnesses a rapid change in the stars, their form, location, and even experiences a novel feeling of pain while looking at one of them without breaks. Amazed, Rikud stands there and asks Chuls about the differences in the viewport and in the sound of the engines, which, as Rikud noticed, had become quieter, but the old man gives an unsatisfying answer. Later, apparently after landing, Rikud sees a huge garden in the viewport and this image doesn\u2019t change for a whole week. \n\nWhile visiting the reading room with Crifer, Rikud decides to open the door that he finds there. It leads to a room where he hears a voice saying something about unauthorized visitors. The next room is full of wires, gears, and cogs. The third one has a small viewport showing the same garden from a different side. When no one believes him later, infuriated, Rikud comes back and destroys the wired room, which he suspects to be the buzzer. Now it doesn\u2019t go off and the food mechanism is not working, leaving the ship's inhabitants confused and hungry. They become angry and try to chase Rikud. The sense of danger forces Rikud to open the little viewport from the third room and finally leave the ship. Everybody goes out into the world and finally sees the garden.\n"

            "The story is located in space, inside of a large spaceship. The ship has a viewport that looks outside of the ship, and is where Rikad spends most of his time. The ship also seems to have high tech, showcased in the med room. Here is where the men go to stay healthy by being showered under health rays. The ship also has a library, which is where Crifer and Rikud read about astronomy and stars, and where Rikud started to doubt more and more about their lifestyle. The ship then arrives at a planet, full of lush greenery, making Rikud more and more suspicious of the changing view. After exploring the back of the room Rikud finds a series of rooms. These rooms include both a machinery room that is full of gears and tubes as well as a control room that has a smaller viewport. The story ends in the new planet, after Rikud opened the door that led outside, knowing that they would be able to survive after he compared the new planet to the gardens that the ship had. ",
            "The story is set on a self-sustaining ship. Rikud starts off observing the space sky from the viewport. Inside of the ship, there is a health-ray bath area; people lie naked under the ray tubes. It is also impossible for people to injure themselves; for example, Rikud was cushioned by something soft when he hurled himself at the wall. There is a library too, but nobody reads anymore so it is covered in dust. There is also a dusty table and a door at the back. Outside of the viewport, a garden soon appears. It is larger than the entire world, with plants that Rikud has never seen before. Later, Rikud confronts Chuls in a room where other people gather as well. There is also a sleeping area for them to rest when the buzzer goes off. The buzzer dictates their entire life. Rikud later goes to a room full of machinery, with cogs and gears that constantly spin. There is also a bright metal rod that he tugs free from the wires that hold it in place. The women\u2019s quarters are located on the ship too, but they are separated from the men. Once they go outside, the air is more fresh than any air Rikud has breathed before. There is also a blue-white globe on the horizon. The water does not flow from machines either, and there are plants everywhere. ",
            "This story takes place on the inside of a ship that is described to be self-sustaining, with food, water, healthy heat lamps and social interaction all provided and guided by a buzzer. On this ship, the characters are led by a routine in which the buzzer will sound a buzz and the next step in the daily routine will commence. The daily routine occurs in a set number of rooms whereby the ship inhabitants eat, sleep, lay amongst the healthy lamp rays, chat amongst each other after dinner, etc. The only doors on this ship are between the men and women, and for rooms like the library or sleeping quarters - besides the ones that Rikud discovers that leads to the machinery room and the outside world. However, the ship itself is a perfect world, where inhabitants are protected from injury. The ship continues its journey and maintains its automation until the supposed journey ends a thousand years from the occurrence of the story - or until its inhabitants find something better. \n\nThe ship floats amongst space and houses a viewport in which characters like Rikud are able to look outside the ship and into the vastness of space and its stars. By the end of the story, the setting transitions to the outside of the ship with the lush greenery, fresh air and water. \n",

The ship is divided into two parts: the male and female sections, the readers follow the life of the male character, Rikud, a twenty-five-year-old man who enjoys thinking about life and looking at the viewport where we find him at the beginning of the story. Then together with the other ship inhabitant Chuls, an old man who doesn\u2019t like thought-provoking ideas, Rikud goes to the health rays room where they get the required scheduled dose of immunity, and we also meet another character - Crifer, a short limping man who occasionally likes reading in the reading room. Rikud gets back to the viewport a few times, noticing how the stars change their form and then surprisingly disappear just to be replaced by an image of a garden - this puzzles him. Later, in the reading room with Crifer, Rikud opens a mysterious doof, leading to a room with a voice that prohibits his unauthorized presence. The next room turns out to be full of wires, cogs, and gears - apparently, it\u2019s the buzzer - the sound system that controls the ship\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 daily life. The last room was a tunnel with a small viewport at the end. When no one believes Rikud, he comes back, upset and angry, and breaks the mechanism in the second room, turning off the buzzer and the food system. Hungry and violent, people chase Rikud who runs back to the small viewport door he found and opens it, leaving the craft. Now everybody was in a large garden, apparently, on some new planet their craft landed on. "

            "Variability is a big part of the story. The inhabitants of the ship have always lived the same routine, the same life, and when things start to change they don\u2019t know how to react. First, when the view of the ship starts to change, Rikud doesn\u2019t understand what it means, and begins to think about the meaning of change. These thoughts are enhanced when Crifer told him that he had been reading Astronomy, and that stars are variable. When the ship lands on the new planet, and Rikud begins to explore, he starts to think about the variability of doors, and the meaning of going through doors and how it relates to the viewport. In the end, the change from having the buzzers to not knowing how to act is what sparks the violence of the men towards Rikud. This is due to the fact that he changed their routine, and having never experienced it, they don\u2019t know how to react to change. ",
            "Variability signifies the change to the lifestyle on the self-sustaining ship. When Crifer brings up the variability of the stars, Chuls is quick to refute the idea and says that nothing is variable. In the story, variability exists when Rikuld begins to notice the sweep of space and the stars. While the others are perfectly content with their lives and believe that they will not leave the ship, Rikuld differentiates from the rest. He wants to explore the greater world and does not believe that their only function is to live on the ship, conceive children, and eventually grow to die. The variability that is he believes he has a greater purpose, and this differentiates him from the rest. It also motivates him to see the world that the ship has landed in once the landscape does not change for a week. ",
            "The concept of variability is significant because it exists in contrast to the world that is presented in the story. The ship, the routine, and the characters that follow the routine are not variable. Everything is premeditated and controlled, with no room for change. However, the changing landscape outside the viewport and Crifer\u2019s base understanding of the astronomy book introduces this idea of variability, which Rikud in particular latches onto as the potential answer for the dissonance he is experiencing. The stars, the sphere, and the garden that they see - could it be due to variability? \n\nAs the story progresses, Rikud begins to better understand the meaning of variability and finds that many concepts around him are in fact variable, like Crifer\u2019s feelings towards him. \n",
            "The story describes the life of people of the future: they live on a big spaceship with a regulated daily schedule consisting of health ray procedures, eating, and limited free time. No one questions the limits of their world, so no one understands the phenomenon of change as it has never occurred in their lives on the craft. Rikud, a young inhabitant of the ship, analyzes the changing views of the stars and tries to explain them. His friend, Crifer, tells him about the stars\u2019 feature called variability that he read about in an old astronomy book. They both do not really understand this concept, neither don\u2019t they understand change, but Rikud needs to rationalize why stars become brighter and change form. His attempts are also hindered by Chuls, an old man who actively claims that both change and variability are useless terms with no real meaning. When the views change again, and the image of a garden replaces the stars, Rikud is even more puzzled. Crifer mentions the variability of stars again, explaining their disappearance, and Rikud starts thinking about the concept of change. He uses the word variable to label everything that is not functioning normally or is unknown to him, including doors, the rooms he finds near the reading room, and people. The term both serves as a stepping stone to an understanding of changes and as an independent notion that explains the differences in behavior, environment, etc. After all, seeking the explanation of change and variability, Rikud opens the viewport-door and enables the others to step outside and see the garden that their craft landed in.

Rikud was a young forward-thinker, and Chuls was an older man who had already lived a lot and tried to guide Rikud on how he should live. As the story progresses more, Rikud seems to stray from Chuls\u2019 guidance and tries to figure out what to think on his own. When Rikud tries to explain his reasoning, Chuls doesn\u2019t understand because he has lived so much time inside of the ship and its routine that he can\u2019t seem to doubt it. This led to Rikud getting mildly violent at Chuls because he couldn\u2019t understand why Chuls didn\u2019t believe him. ",

Chuls is content with how he lives, but he does care for Rikud when he tells him to eat. Rikud, on the other hand, does not like that Chuls is content with how he lives his life. He is angry that Chuls is so dismissive of his ideas and thinks that all the other man cares about is eating. When Rikud asks Chuls to come to see the garden, he refuses and thinks about eating again. Rikud is furious and grabs him by the shirt; everybody else copies this action. Although Chuls is not as angry as Crifer when Rikud breaks the machine, he is sad because he does not have a purpose of living by the buzzer\u2019s announcement. ",
            "The relationship between Rikud and Chuls is antagonistic. Rikud is presented as the wild card who sees the changing star, who begins to question the routine aboard the ship and who ultimately incites new and unfamiliar behaviors and feelings amongst the other men on the ship. On the other hand, Chuls is an old man who follows the rule without question and content with the life he lives. \n\nFor example, when Rikud and Crifer begin to discuss the word \u201cvariability\u201d and the potential of the changing stars being variable, Chuls quickly shuts down this idea by adamantly declaring that the word itself is a contradiction - and that they should go eat. When looking at the changed landscape of the star through the viewport, Rikud and Crifer begin to question why the garden is in the viewport, but Chuls simply says that it is the viewport. Therein lies the tension between these two characters, with Rikud constantly questioning and probing and Chuls remaining steadfast in his routine and knowledge of the world. \n",

Rikud is a young curious man, he thinks about the future and the past and sometimes thinks outside the box.

He is not seeking answers and has no urge to understand the world or see anything beyond the walls of the spaceship.

The changing stars that he could see through the viewport is what inspired Rikud to think more about the changes going on around him and to explore hhhhhh\bhe ship. Ultimately it is the viewport that showed him the possibility of a new life on the planet. The viewport essentially lead Rikud to breaking the engine room and to opening the door of the ship. ",
            "The viewport that Rikud looks through initially shows a great changeless sweep of space. He believes that there is a greater purpose for him in the world, even if he has spent his entire life on the ship. There is a bright star that Rikuld sees through it, and it bothers him nonstop. When he looks through the viewport again, he sees that the bright central star has become a blue-tinged globe of light. This is extremely significant because what Rikud is observing is actually the ship\u2019s landing on a new planet. This motivates him to investigate further, and he finds that the scenery has not changed for a week after a garden begins to enter the viewport\u2019s field of vision. The viewport also serves as a reason for Rikud to break the ship\u2019s buzzer announcement system; this stops everybody from living their pre-programmed way of life and to leave the ship for the more mysterious world outside. Without the viewport, Rikud would have never noticed the changes in space and as they eventually land on the planet. ",

It is only when he begins to notice the change in the stars, the appearance of a sphere with blue and green, and a bright light that he further questions why the men live on the ship and not outside. Additionally, it is significant because the viewport is one-dimensional in that all information is one-way. Whatever Rikud and the other men see through the viewport can only be explained by them, and so they have no way of knowing if it is true or not. As seen in the story, many times the other men are reluctant to even wonder what it is or simply shrug and move on. \n",
            "The story talks about our distant future. Humans left Earth long ago and now live on a spaceship that has been traveling through space for centuries. Everyone on the ship lives by the buzzer - a sound that signifies the beginning or the end of any daily activity: eating, sleeping, free time. They do not understand the concepts of change, space, because their life is limited to the rooms of the ship. The main character, Rikud, is a young man who enjoys looking at the viewport - it allows him to see the stars surrounding the ship and the cosmic blackness. He spends some time every day contemplating the view and notices when the stars change in size and location, disappearing from the view. This observation makes him think about variability and change, what these terms mean. When sometime later Rikud sees an unchanging image of a garden instead of cosmos in the viewport, he starts questioning the space he\u2019s so long lived in. His attempt to rationalize this makes him more curious, and soon he finds another viewport that also looks like a door to the outer world. A different angle of view surprises him since he has always thought that there\u2019s only one possible viewpoint on this ship. After days of chaotic thoughts and revelations, after breaking the buzzer and causing the inhabitants\u2019 anger, Rikud finally opens the small viewport and sets foot in the garden, allowing everyone else to leave the ship, too.
