    "The group needed changes in tasks to collect explicit data to determine how much of the decisions they want to build into data collection. They could call people who visit the zoo, \"Visit the zoo tomorrow\", so there is an intention to see something, but not now, but later. The group also decided that they needed to decide what things are actually going to matter to them. Professor D.'s opinion was that the data gathering should include one service, one luxury item, and one big-ish place because the data would be easier to handle. He also thought that there was a possible danger that somehow there are certain constructions that people use when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff, so the simpler the better.\n",
    "The team discussed the value of user and situation models in the context of designing a remote control. The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are tasked with guiding the project manager on what is possible and what users would want, balancing basic functionality with desirable features.\n\nThe User Interface Designer suggested a touch screen remote with multi-format capabilities, drawing inspiration from PDA designs. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of high-quality materials to avoid a cheap feel, and proposed a locator device to prevent loss.\n\nMarketing brought up the user budget, noting that the target price of twenty-five Euros might be considered expensive. She also brought up the importance of considering the target demographic, as a more traditional user base might not be receptive to a completely redesigned interface. The team agreed to brainstorm further and consider trade-offs between features, cost, and user expectations.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal concerns about the Canadian economy's uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cathy McLeod criticizes the government for not providing an economic update and for prioritizing other sectors over the forestry industry. She accuses the government of sidelining Parliament and describes the Canadian economy as being in trouble prior to COVID. Mona Fortier acknowledges the economic uncertainty but defends the government's transparency and support measures, stating that an update will be provided as soon as clear economic projections are possible. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie did not appear to offer an opinion on this matter in the provided transcripts.\n",
    "The industrial designer, Tarik, drew a tiger on the whiteboard. He mentioned several characteristics that he found appealing, including the tiger's stripes and orange color, and its status as the \"best looking\" of the big cats. He also mentioned that his father, who was from Bangladesh, used to tell him about tigers when he was a child.\n",
    "The team discussed the transcriber interface, noting that the current interface limited the ability to encode overlaps completely. The team also considered alternative tools that could provide a more detailed representation of overlaps, such as a musical score notation. Susanne Burger at CMU was mentioned as having a tool that can handle eight channels simultaneously. Praat (PRAAT) was also mentioned.\nThe team also discussed the possibility of modifying the existing interface to better represent overlaps, with Dave Gelbart volunteering to do so. There was a suggestion to create different output files for each channel to better preserve overlaps.\n",
    "The presentations covered several aspects of designing a new remote control. The components design presentation focused on the materials for the remote's case (wood being the proposed option), chip design (recommending an advanced chip with an infrared sender), and integrating features like solar cells, microphones, and speakers.\n\nThe market findings presentation revealed that consumers are looking for a \"fancy and feel-good\" product with innovative technology. The presentation on the user interface components emphasized simplicity and ease of use, suggesting essential buttons (on/off, channel, volume) and a menu button for additional functions. A flip screen was proposed to avoid accidental button presses.\n\nThe trend watching presentation indicated a preference for sleek, stylish designs and a willingness to pay more for voice recognition, especially among younger demographics. Other desired features included long battery life and a locator function.\n",
    "The discussion of the early implementer areas centered around gathering data helpful for user interface (UI) design, particularly for querying. One idea was to use CrossPads for note-taking during meetings, allowing participants to write down thoughts and mark them, providing a summary without solicitation. However, handwriting recognition quality was a concern.\n\nThe group also explored using summaries, either taken by a designated note-taker or recorded orally from multiple people immediately after the meeting. These summaries could help generate queries and identify key words or \"hot spots\" in the meeting. The challenge was to motivate participants to contribute summaries and ensure they reflected genuine information needs. The summaries were thought to be a reasonable bootstrap into determining the queries that people may want to ask.\n\nLessons learned included the need for simple, non-intrusive data collection methods and the importance of capturing both structured summaries and spontaneous insights. Additionally, the group recognized the value of incorporating contextual information, such as spatial positions of people and board content, to enhance the overall understanding of the meeting dynamics.",
    "The Project Manager believes speech recognition is less favored than an LCD display and suggests scrapping it to meet cost constraints. The manager acknowledges the trendiness of custom covers and sees them as a way to offer design options without increasing the base product cost. Despite initial marketing research favoring a spongy feel, the Project Manager prioritizes rubber for durability. They also consider plastic as an option for the basic cover to reduce costs, but are concerned about losing the \"squishy feeling.\" The manager sees LCD incorporation as expensive and unnecessary. Button design is viewed as less important than color when considering style.\n",
    "The team discussed standardizing recording conventions, focusing on microphone types and placement to improve data consistency for downstream tasks like dialogue analysis and prosody. There was a consensus on using close-talking, head-mounted microphones consistently across speakers to minimize variability in signal capture. The team decided to purchase several identical microphones that were comfortable to wear.\n\nRegarding video recordings, there was interest in incorporating video, but concerns were raised about infrastructure requirements, human subject considerations (privacy), and the lack of a dedicated researcher to manage the video component. The team acknowledged that video could be valuable, as other research sites, like SRI, were investing in meeting recordings with video. However, no immediate decisions were made to incorporate video due to the aforementioned challenges. The team did discuss array microphones and beam forming, but decided against this due to infrastructure and processing overhead.",
    "The discussion on project finance revolved around keeping production costs under twelve and a half Euro. To achieve this, several design elements were reconsidered. The team initially planned for a double-curved case, but to save one Euro, they considered a single-curved design. Other cost-cutting measures included removing the L_C_D_ panel and advanced chip, relying instead on the T_V_ screen to display functions. Color differentiation for buttons was also scrapped to reduce expenses.\n\nThe SMARTboard was introduced as a tool for illustrating views and sharing information. However, it was criticized for being slow, imprecise, and not user-friendly. Participants felt it took too much time to draw and write, and the pen was not precise. Some suggested that traditional methods like pens and flip-charts might be quicker and more effective. The team also discussed the need for improvements to the software, such as predefined shapes and a voting mechanism for decision-making.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer, Christine, expressed a need for more clarity regarding the project's goals, initially believing they were designing a monitor instead of a remote control. She emphasized the importance of a fashionable and attractive design, suggesting a product similar to the iPod in terms of visual appeal. Later, she felt \"blind\" during the project due to a lack of information on available materials and finances.\n\nThe Project Manager, Shrida Daseri, focused on defining project goals, timelines, and budget constraints. She pressed for project plans and designs from the team members, particularly from the marketing and industrial design teams. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the marketing team's initial lack of planning.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the team was generally in agreement about the final design, which included a basic remote control with exchangeable covers. She acknowledged that the team had made compromises to stay within budget, such as removing speech recognition and special colors. She also realized the importance of better communication and information sharing among team members to avoid wasted effort and improve the design process.\n",
    "The team explored three base designs: the \"Martian,\" the \"rhombus,\" and the \"potato,\" ultimately leaning towards the \"potato\" for its ergonomic shape. The decision-making process involved presenting the prototypes, discussing button layouts, and considering color options.\n\nFashionability was a key evaluation criterion. The team debated fruity colors versus toned-down options to appeal to a broader demographic while avoiding a toy-like appearance. They also considered features like a latex case for its tactile appeal and potential for preventing RSI. The team evaluated existing remotes, noting the common frustration of losing them. They brainstormed solutions like bright colors and a locator device, but the latter was deemed technologically challenging and potentially gimmicky.\n\nUltimately, they prioritized simplicity and fashionability, aiming for a remote that was both functional and visually appealing. The final design incorporated a corporate logo and colors, reflecting the brand identity.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of a potential remote control design. They explored the use of environmentally friendly materials, with a focus on spongy rubber and latex for a comfortable feel. Current trends in fashion, particularly the appeal of fruits and vegetables to younger consumers, were considered as inspiration for the remote's shape and color scheme. Potential materials like plastic, titanium, and wood were debated, weighing their aesthetic and functional properties.\n\nThe inclusion of an LCD screen was extensively discussed, with concerns raised about cost, user-friendliness, and its coherence with a simple, sturdy design. The use of voice recognition and its integration with the remote's design were also explored. Different button designs, including the use of scroll wheels, were considered for ease of use. Finally, the idea of a questionnaire to gather public opinion on different design options was proposed.\n",
    "The Project Manager, User Interface, and Industrial Designer introduced a remote control prototype with a plastic body, customizable colors/patterns, and a black and white LCD touchscreen. The top screen would have available functions, while the bottom screen would have standard buttons. Kinetic batteries and a voice recognition system (\"Where is the remote?\") were considered.\n\nThe group discussed multi-functional (LCD screen, advanced chip) versus single-functional (push buttons) products, ultimately deciding to keep the LCD screen for its innovation. Lower grades in the technological aspect were due to the limited use of advanced features and the cost constraints that led to compromises in the design.\n\nThe functional requirement of a locator was initially considered with voice recognition or a beeper function, but due to cost constraints, it was removed.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C discussed the speech energy and overlap representation. PhD C used a Munich system with Gaussian mixtures for speech and nonspeech, modifying parameters for silence insertion. They noted that the interface limitations affect how transcribers encode overlaps, considering musical score notation as an ideal representation. Jose is going to vary the number and also look at moving windows. And the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain, may not be the right thing to do.\n\nDue to these overlaps, problems arise in accurately capturing start and end points. PhD A suggested a modified interface for better representation. It was decided to continue with the current system, acknowledging the limitations in capturing fine time-scale overlaps. They aim to balance data collection with interface improvements for better overlap representation.\n",
    "The discussion on latency revolved around reducing delays in the system to meet a 250-millisecond requirement. Professor C was concerned about the overall latency and its impact on system performance. The initial total latency was 330 milliseconds.\n\nPhD B detailed various sources of latency, including the LDA filters (reduced from 200ms to 64ms for low frequency and 11ms for high frequency using IIR filters), downsampling (adding 10ms), and online normalization (adding 85ms). The neural net and PCA contributed another 80ms.\n\nProfessor C's issue stemmed from the fact that other groups wanted the allowable latency to be lower, around 30 or 40 milliseconds, but the current system could not achieve this without sacrificing performance. The professor felt that the system was trading latency for performance, while others were trading computation for performance. Additionally, the fact that the system had such high latency was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication between the members of the group.\n",
    "The detailed design of the prototype by User Interface introduced several key features and advantages. Firstly, the remote included basic TV functions plus a locator, cradle, and scroll wheel for channels. A new zapping functionality for favorite channels was integrated into the scroll wheel. The design incorporated rubber buttons for durability and ergonomics.\n\nAdvantages included the \"where's my remote\" base station button, and charging capabilities via the blue nodes on the base. While a trigger button was considered, it was decided against for the initial design to avoid accidental power button presses, with the possibility of tweaking it in later versions. The design aimed for different model options. The marketing perspective highlighted marketable features and overall satisfaction with the design, emphasizing the potential for a competitive product with a market niche.\n",
    "The prototype presentation began with a discussion of two versions of the remote. The first version was snowman-shaped with no LCD display, kinetic power, rubber buttons, backlighting, and a jog-dial. However, due to cost, the design shifted to a new prototype.\n\nThe final prototype was gunmetal gray, plastic, and thumb-shaped. It featured a concave curvature for finger placement, black labeling, and channel and volume controls on either side. The base would light up when any button was pressed. The remote included an on/off switch and two squared buttons for menu and mute. The two versions of the prototype were also designed with a consideration for right and left-handed people.\n\nThe discussion then moved to evaluation criteria, including ease of use, fashionability, and feel. The team used a seven-point scale to rate the prototype. Ultimately, the final model was deemed a winner with the hope of selling millions.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the touch screen, flip screens, battery issues, and flip-top design, balancing functionality with budget constraints. Initially, a touch screen was considered a key marketable feature, but high costs led to its rejection. A flip design was chosen, with an LCD on top and rubber buttons below.\n\nBattery options were debated, including standard, solar, and kinetic charging. Concerns about the size, cost, and practicality of solar charging, along with the kinetic option's effectiveness, led to further consideration of standard batteries, prioritizing longevity and user convenience.\n\nThe flip-top design aimed to offer a unique, non-traditional remote. Plastic was selected for the body, with a rubberized cover for a spongy feel and customizable designs. The group explored incorporating voice recognition and a \"find my remote\" feature to enhance user experience. The group tried to balance cost and customer expectations, as well as marketing strategies.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Welsh Government has taken several lessons from the three-year Schools Challenge Cymru investment. One key takeaway is the recognition that identifying struggling schools early is crucial. The Chief Inspector noted that schools causing concern were not being identified early enough, which led to a failure in the system.\n\nThe program's progress was variable. While there were overall improvements in the 40 schools involved compared to the general improvement in all Welsh schools, the extent of the success was limited considering the significant investment. The program's effectiveness was also dependent on the collaboration and coordination among the various parties involved, with some schools experiencing conflicting advice from different agencies. Estyn's engagement with the program also indicated that the program was not wildly successful, as many of the schools inspected during the program's final year were still in special measures or required significant improvement.",
    "According to Dr. David Blaney, Brexit has led to a decrease of 8% in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 2% increase in England. Dr. Blaney states that this decline is likely due to the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to find the full fee amount, and the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. He also indicates that the relative levels of investment in facilities, particularly buildings and equipment, between Wales and England play a role in attracting prospective students, as the state of repair of campuses influences student choices. Dr. Blaney states that Wales is seen as a safe environment and that universities in Wales offer a UK-quality system and degree.\n",
    "The domains in the mental spaces are Situation, User, Discourse, and Ontology (SUDO). These domains provide input to the Evidence Understanding (EDU) layer, which is modeled as a Bayes net. The middle layer functions by probabilistically determining the final destination, whether the person is doing business, in a hurry, or a tourist.\n\nThe features extracted from communication, like where someone wants to go, what they've said previously, prosody, discourse, and verb choice, point to this middle layer. The hidden variables in this middle layer represent concepts like whether someone is on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry. These concepts then influence the mode of interaction (e.g., Enter, Vista, Tango). The \"context\" feature is limited to \"business person,\" \"tourist,\" or \"unknown.\"\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the professor's thoughts on the back-end and storing data are limited, but they are present. The professor mentions that the database is quite large and is currently in German. There is a commissioned translation of some of the database, specifically the more general descriptions of objects, persons, and events. The professor believes the database is well-formed due to the existence of an ontology within it. There are not any deep mysteries about what the system knows, due to the database. The professor also mentions that the database is pretty well-formed.",
    "**Seniors Care Crisis:** The meetings highlighted the disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes, with reports of neglect, abuse, and appalling conditions witnessed by the Canadian Armed Forces. There was a call for national standards for long-term care, possibly governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act, and for the removal of profit from long-term care. The government expressed willingness to support provinces on this issue while respecting their jurisdiction.\n\n**Racism and Long-Term Care:** One MP stated that the Indian Act enshrined racism into Canadian law in 1876 and, through residential schools, the child welfare system, our legal system and our police, we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples. One MP asked the government to review the use of force as outlined for the RCMP and ensure racial profiling, street checks, and carding are expressly prohibited at the federal level.\n\n**Workers' and Pensioners' Rights:** Discussions included amendments to policies protecting workers' and pensioners' rights, particularly in the context of emergency benefits and wage subsidies. Concerns were raised about eligibility criteria and the need for flexibility to support various business structures.\n\n**Hon. Lawrence MacAulay's Perspective on Veterans:** Hon. Lawrence MacAulay encouraged public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families.\n\n**Minister of Seniors' Statement on Pandemic Assistance:** The Minister of Seniors discussed pandemic assistance for seniors, including a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for those eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for those eligible for GIS, as well as funding for initiatives to help seniors with grocery deliveries and staying connected.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing representative, and Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding the remote control design due to their differing priorities and areas of expertise. Marketing focused on attracting consumers through a fancy look and feel, incorporating current fashion trends like fruit and vegetable themes, and ensuring the remote was innovative. The Industrial Designer was concerned with the user interface, production costs, the practicality of features like the kinetic battery, ergonomic design, and technical limitations. The Project Manager tried to balance these competing interests, considering the overall project goals, corporate branding, and cost constraints. These different perspectives led to disagreements on aspects like parental control, shape, color, front buttons, wireless control, technical design, and style, as each participant advocated for their respective priorities and expertise.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation based on user requirements and market trends identified in previous meetings and marketing reports. The evaluation criteria were:\n\n*   **Fancy look and feel:** Focused on aesthetics and appeal.\n*   **Technological innovation:** Incorporating the latest technologies.\n*   **Ease of use:** Simple and intuitive operation.\n*   **Current fashion trends:** Including spongy texture and fruit/vegetable-inspired colors.\n*   **Minimization of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI):** Ergonomic design to reduce strain.\n*   **Easy to locate:** Incorporating features like voice recognition or a beeper function.\n\nMarketing used a rating system to evaluate how well the prototype met each criterion, with input from the project manager, user interface expert, and industrial designer. The team discussed each criterion and assigned individual ratings, which were then averaged to determine the overall score. This process helped them assess whether the product met the market's needs and aligned with the company's strategy.",
    "The transcription status is being handled by Jane, who has hired new transcribers. The IBM transcription is expected back next week. Transcripts and audio will be available to participants with links to web pages. The audio will be uncompressed. The SPG schema is indexed by meeting type and user ID. Don is working on the back end. Regarding disk space, the project is running out of un-backed-up disk space on Abbott. The group is considering using spare disks on new SPARC-Blade SUN-Blades. Samosa has an eighteen-gig drive available.",
    "In discussions about the duty to promote public awareness, the Deputy Minister emphasized that amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law. She argued against specifying particular groups or topics on the face of the Bill, as suggested by Janet Finch-Saunders' amendments, believing it would unnecessarily constrain the awareness-raising campaign.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister moved amendment 2, reflecting a committee recommendation for a post-implementation review. She opposed amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign before section 1 commences, citing concerns about delaying the commencement date. However, she expressed willingness to consider an interim report at Stage 3 and to consult with the committee on its contents.\n\nThe Deputy Minister did not directly address regulation-making powers in the provided meeting transcripts.\n",
    "The discussion on long-term trends in raising standards and improving educational attainment highlighted concerns about the current system's pressures and the need for sufficient time for system readiness. Philip Blaker emphasized Qualifications Wales' role in maintaining standards and ensuring fair grading during periods of change, prescribing comparable outcomes to address specification changes. Looking ahead, he noted the importance of timelines for reforms related to the new curriculum and suggested a review of the reliance on commercial publishers for textbooks.\n\nRegarding the lack of exams, the transcripts do not provide specific details on timescales for addressing this issue.\n",
    "The discussion on implementing good practice across Wales highlighted the challenges of inconsistency in early childhood education and care provision. Historically, local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education, resulting in variance across Wales. The Welsh Government aims to address these differences and is testing consistent funding rates in a pilot project in Flintshire. They recognize the crucial role of local authorities in deciding how things develop in their areas.\n\nThe demand-driven approach to the childcare market, where subsidies are mainly given to working parents, was questioned. It was suggested that a more universal approach might be beneficial. The Welsh Government is developing a more integrated approach towards the early years, with Estyn and CIW continuing to inspect and regulate the sector to ensure standards. A specific program has been established to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce.\n",
    "The team discussed the components and interface design for a remote control prototype. The case material was a key consideration, with wood being chosen for its ergonomic shape, customizability through staining, and environmental friendliness. Alternative materials like rubber, plastic, and titanium were ruled out due to heat concerns, brittleness, and manufacturing limitations. The interface design included considerations for button placement, the inclusion of an LCD screen on a flip panel (though its cost was a concern), and voice recognition. The team explored the possibility of customized backing for the remote, depending on the circuit board design. The microphone placement for voice recognition was debated, considering ease of use and functionality. The availability of components such as sample sensors, speakers, wood material, special colors, and push buttons were confirmed to be within budget.\n",
    "Professor A believes the final model's performance on the Meeting Recorder digits (3-4% error rate) is significantly worse than the TI-digits database (0.8% error rate). He attributes this difference primarily to the amount of training data, suggesting that commercial systems use vast amounts of data to capture variations in allophones. He thinks the recording conditions are a factor, but noise and channel normalization are not to blame.\n\nThe discussion on time series revolved around using factorial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model feature detectors. A student, Grad B, discussed using modulation spectrum stuff to deal with reverberation, referencing Avendano's work, which uses longer time windows to encompass reverberation effects.\n\nRegarding pronouncing \"zero,\" the team decided to allow people to say either \"zero\" or \"O\" when reading digits, aiming for more natural speech patterns. In past data collection efforts, they had scripted the pronunciation of \"0\".\n",
    "The group discussed introducing a new remote control, deciding it should be television-only and align with the slogan \"we put fashion in electronics.\" Initially, there was a discussion of a universal remote concept, but the board decided against it. The team favored plastic over metal for the remote's casing due to potential interference and safety concerns. They explored the idea of voice recognition, particularly for basic functions like volume control, to appeal to a younger demographic.\n\nParental control was not discussed. Instead, the team considered integrating a paging system for locating the remote, possibly voice-activated. The group also considered a touch screen with submenus for less frequently used functions and a simple button design for the older market. They briefly considered including faceplates to customize the remote, but abandoned the idea. Integrating games was not discussed.",
    "The committee discussed mental health issues and suicide rates among children and young people during the pandemic. Vaughan Gething admitted that a full assessment of the mental health impact is difficult due to limited contact with families but assured that it is a priority. He mentioned a commissioned review, expected by the end of the month, to investigate unexpected deaths and potential links to restrictions affecting mental health. Crisis care services remain available, and the government is trying to maintain and expand online and telephone support.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Vaughan Gething acknowledged the challenges and uncertainty faced by new mothers during the pandemic. He noted a decrease in women seeking mother and baby unit provision due to fear and lockdown concerns. He expressed commitment to continued support for perinatal mental health services, including exploring phone and online options, while also addressing delays in establishing in-patient capacity due to the pandemic.\n",
    "The implementation work is expected to be finished in January 2020 with final publication of the curriculum and actual implementation in schools by September 2022.\n\nThe group has broad support for the curriculum changes being proposed, but there are concerns about the language used and ensuring consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered, which could affect outcomes. The main concern is the potential for the curriculum to exacerbate segregation between different groups of pupils. They are addressing the consistency issue by changing their approach to the legislation around the Bill, including a statutory framework to ensure progression is the same throughout Wales.\n\nThe group believes that empowering teachers to be more flexible in what they teach gives them an opportunity to deliver lessons that are more engaging and relevant to schoolchildren.\n\nNetworking within the PRU and transition arrangements were not discussed in the meeting transcript.\n",
    "The group discussed the infra-red functionality as the best way to project information to the receiver because a sight line isn't needed. The user interface is critical because the chip converts electrical energy into data which goes through the infra-red. The group thought a reliable and clear infra-red signal was needed.\n\nRegarding disposable income, the group discussed their target audience and agreed on a younger demographic (15-35) because this population has more disposable income to spend on technology. The group also agreed that the goal was simplicity and fashion in the design, rather than technological advancement, but the younger demographic still wanted a fancy remote.",
    "The group has a mixed opinion on using eligibility for free school meals as a measure of identifying pupils to target. While they acknowledge its limitations, it is seen as the best available proxy for need in the absence of a better alternative. The group is actively exploring alternative measures, considering the impact of Universal Credit and potential changes to eligibility criteria.\n\nRegarding the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, the group acknowledges that improvements have been made, but there is still a significant gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and their non-free-school-meal counterparts. They highlight examples of schools using PDG funding for initiatives like walking buses and family support workers to improve attendance and address barriers to engagement. They also recognize the need for a multi-agency approach and targeted interventions to address the complex social issues affecting attendance and engagement for these pupils.",
    "The professor's views on support vector machines (SVMs) were that they were a succinct classification method that worked reasonably well with less data. SVMs find the optimal separating plane between different classes in a feature space and remember the feature examples closest to the boundary. He stated that neural nets and Gaussian mixtures are brute force methods and that SVMs can be a reduced parameterization of the model by keeping certain selected examples.\nRegarding speech rate algorithms, the professor did not explicitly express thoughts on the topic. However, speech rate was mentioned in the context of developing standards for the cellular industry, and the professor seemed open to exploring different features and approaches for speech recognition in that context.\n",
    "The professor believes echoes, reverberation, and acoustic events are important factors in speech recognition. He mentions that artifacts like echoes in resynthesized audio could confuse the system by misaligning phones. He suggests exploring methods to reduce these artificial reverberation-like effects, potentially by removing low-energy sections where reverberation is most audible.\n\nThe professor also discusses acoustic events, noting that distant microphones are better for capturing overlapping speech, while close-talking microphones might be useful for other phenomena. The professor suggests focusing on speaker overlaps as a distinct phenomenon, due to the time-consuming nature of marking all acoustic events. However, he also acknowledges the potential of inferring speaker overlap from energy levels, potentially using close-talking microphones.\n",
    "The team decided to focus the user interface design on simplicity and ease of use, primarily for television control. They agreed to limit the number of buttons, focusing on essential functions like power, channel, and volume. The team considered and ultimately decided to incorporate speech recognition for channel selection and other basic commands. They also wanted to include a feature to help locate the remote when lost, which could be achieved through speech recognition, where the remote responds to a voice command. They wanted to use bright colors, incorporating the company's logo and slogan (\"We put fashion in electronics\") for a trendy and fashionable design. The team also discussed the materials, leaning towards a rubbery, more bouncy material for durability and a more organic shape to avoid sharp corners, with consideration for child safety.\n",
    "The project manager had specific thoughts on the plastic material, changeable cover, color, and shape of the remote control model. They agreed with using plastic as the main case housing due to design flexibility, allowing for curved shapes. They were open to the idea of changeable covers, similar to mobile phone skins, to allow customers to customize the color and look of their remote. The project manager was in favor of the rubber cover because it was a cheap way of changing the look of the remote. They also liked the idea of vegetable and fruit colors for the rubber cover. Finally, they thought a different shape from normal would be good so that it would stand out.\n",
    "The discussion focused on fixing issues and improving the baseline for the speech recognition system. Key areas of focus included:\n\n*   **Transcription Status:** Addressing delays in transcription due to IBM's processing and exploring parallel transcription options.\n*   **Data Storage:** Managing disk space limitations, particularly with uncompressed audio files, and considering options for expanding storage using available hardware.\n*   **System Performance:** Evaluating the performance of different front-end configurations, including PLP and Mel Cepstra, and exploring system combination techniques to improve recognition accuracy.\n*   **Feature Engineering:** Investigating various front-end features like RASTA and MSG, and discussing the potential benefits of tandem systems and alternative phone sets.\n*   **Noise Robustness:** Addressing the challenges of noisy speech recognition, particularly in mismatched conditions, and exploring techniques like spectral subtraction and filtering.\n\nThe team is working towards stabilizing the system, optimizing performance, and addressing issues related to data management and noise robustness.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on a range of topics. Regarding legislation, there was a focus on firearms regulations, with concerns raised about targeting law-abiding gun owners and the effectiveness of the measures. Additionally, there were discussions around organ harvesting and trafficking, and the need for legislation to address this issue.\n\nIn terms of economic support, the transcripts mention government assistance for various sectors impacted by COVID-19, including energy resources, tourism, and small businesses. There was also discussion about funding for a green economy and ensuring a just transition for workers in the fossil fuel sector. The impact of COVID-19 on fishing, tourism, oil, and gas was also a key concern, with members discussing the need for direct financial help for those affected.\n",
    "The team discussed various aspects of the remote control's design and functionality. Initially, the team leaned towards a curved or double-curved case for fashion, but later decided on a single-curved design. The team also considered the idea of a spongy, latex casing for grip and comfort, inspired by current trends. They discussed the feasibility of different materials, including titanium, wood, plastic, and rubber, and explored the possibility of changeable covers in fruit and vegetable colors.\n\nThe team considered personalization, with ideas such as changeable faceplates. The team agreed that the remote should have a novel shape, potentially inspired by a snowman. The team decided against a touch screen due to cost and complexity. The team decided on a jog dial for volume and channel control and pushbuttons for other functions. They decided against a talk-back feature.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed lemon or lime colors for the product to align with an emerging top European fashion trend of incorporating fruit and vegetables into designs, especially in clothing and furniture. The team felt it was important to observe this trend but also be cautious of how it translates to electronics, suggesting the color scheme as a theme to unify the product's marketing identity. They were fond of the idea of lemon or lime, as they see it associated with texture, shape, and colors that would make the product seem gimmicky with lighting within the product.",
    "The overall conclusion is that the team has a product specification and prototype design that largely meet the criteria derived from market research. The remote control will have a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and be easy to use while incorporating current fashion trends.\n\nSpecifically, the design will include a plastic body with neutral colors and customizable faces, a black and white touchscreen, kinetic batteries (possibly rechargeable), and voice recognition (although this was later removed to meet budget requirements). The design also aims to minimize repetitive strain injury (RSI) with the type of buttons used, although this was the lowest rated criteria.\n\nAdjustments were made based on market research, including the removal of teletext functionality and limiting the control to TVs only. The team also discussed the potential for a beeper function to help locate the remote. While the team initially considered voice recognition, it was ultimately deemed too costly and removed from the base model.\n\nDespite some concerns, the team is happy to proceed with the prototype and market it, believing that it meets the necessary specifications and that further modifications to minimize RSI would be difficult with current technology.\n",
    "Future of institutions were assessed in the context of systemic racism against Indigenous people and Black Canadians, with calls to reimagine and rework institutions, including the police. The need for economic updates from the Liberal government was also a recurring theme, with criticisms about transparency and accountability.\n\nDiscussions on women's issues included perinatal mental health, the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security, and concerns about the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women.\n\nThe committee heard statements on housing, including calls for a nationwide rent freeze, eviction freeze, mortgage freeze, and utility freeze. There were also discussions on the need for a national housing strategy and support for provinces to address homelessness.\n\nMembers discussed a wide range of issues, including the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, the Trans Mountain pipeline, firearms legislation, conversion therapy, euthanasia, long-term care, support for seniors, aid to veterans, and the pandemic's impact on various sectors, such as tourism and the arts.\n",
    "The group discussed the digits task, focusing on the results obtained using different systems. The system based on HTK was significantly worse than the SRI system, even though the digits task has a relatively small number of words. One reason for this difference may be that the digits recorded in their room with close mikes are harder than the studio-recorded TI-digits. The close-talking setup still picks up some noise and room acoustics. Additionally, the studio recordings are cleaner because any funny pronunciations were removed, whereas the present recordings had some corrections but were not as clean.\n\nThe group also considered using supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data to adapt the models to the room acoustics and far-field microphones. They discussed whether to focus on using the digits task as a starter task for conversational speech or to focus on connected digits over the telephone. The group then discussed what to do with the data they had and what was missing, they concluded that they wanted to have the ability to feed it different features.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the primary reason for recommending a speech recognition interface is to differentiate the product from competitors by including a key feature that users may find appealing, even if they don't use it all the time.\n\nThe user interface designer sees speech recognition as a way to provide flexibility to the user. The industrial designer suggests that speech recognition could help locate the remote if lost and agrees that the remote can still have buttons. The marketing expert notes that adding speech recognition can help locate the remote control, which enhances market sales. The marketing expert also suggests that a good-looking remote control would lead to more sales.\n",
    "The transcripts primarily focus on the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) in Wales, discussing its targeting, eligibility criteria based on free school meals, and its use for both individual interventions and universal approaches like growth mindset training. Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education, defends the use of free school meals as a proxy for need, while acknowledging its limitations. There's discussion on the role of regional consortia and PDG regional advisers in ensuring proper and consistent use of the grant, and concerns about the attainment gap and exam board responsibilities are raised.\n\nThe discussion on looked-after children and adopted children focuses on the visibility of PDG for these groups, the strategic deployment of resources, and the potential for adjusting eligibility criteria. The EAS consortium's approach of targeting vulnerable learners in general is also discussed.\n\nThe Canadian transcripts cover a range of topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including petitions, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), support for businesses and individuals, and economic updates. There's a debate on potential fraud related to CERB applications and the government's response. The Auditor General's funding and ability to conduct audits are also discussed. Bill Blair responds to concerns about firearms seizures, emphasizing the government's focus on military-style assault rifles and collaboration with law enforcement. Social stability is addressed through measures like the CERB and support for vulnerable populations. The political background involves the Liberal government's response to the pandemic and criticisms from opposition parties regarding spending, transparency, and support programs. The aim of the group seems to be to examine the government's actions and hold them accountable during the pandemic.\n",
    "The team discussed several functions for the remote control. A key realization was the need for a \"lost-and-found\" function, initially suggested as a beep triggered by clapping or a light signal. The team considered a sensor that detects darkness (like when the remote is covered) to trigger the signal, but also discussed voice or clapping activation. \n\nImprovements discussed during the project evaluation included ergonomic considerations (hand-held, portable, organic shapes), fewer buttons (focusing on essential functions), and a more durable design (shock resistance).\n\nNew functions brainstormed involved speech recognition, a glow-in-the-dark feature, and a rechargeable station. The team also considered a T_F_T_ display, but raised concerns about cost and durability. They discussed incorporating the company's corporate colors and slogan into the design.\n",
    "During the discussion about finance, the group initially planned for special colors on all sixteen buttons of the remote control. However, due to budget constraints, they had to make a choice between features to stay under the 12.5 Euro production cost limit.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied because the removal of special colors detracted from the trendy look and feel of the product, which was considered important for attracting customers. The original design included a red \"apple\" button and potentially other colored buttons to enhance the product's appeal. When the project manager took out the special color, Marketing felt it ruined the remote control, but they also thought the custom covers were a nice idea that would allow the product to be manufactured with one base.\n",
    "Here are the key points discussed regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension, employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales:\n\n**Welsh Dimension:**\nThe Welsh bac, intended to improve skills for employment, has \"lost its way.\" Employers' input is needed to ensure employability and entrepreneurial skills play a key role. There is a need to join up employers, schools, and education facilities more effectively.\n\n**Employers' Understanding of the Welsh Bac:**\nEmployers generally don't understand the Welsh bac, its value, or what it includes. Some employers may appreciate it, but it needs to be \"sold\" to them. They are more focused on core qualifications and skills. A review of the qualification is needed, with employers having ownership of the process. It is not well understood or valued by many Russell Group universities.\n\n**Independent Body for Inspecting in Wales:**\nThe transcripts do not contain any points regarding the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales.",
    "The group discussed the convenience of presentation materials, especially transcripts, for participants to review and potentially bleep out sections they don't want included in the final corpus.\n\nSome members preferred a web-based interface with passwords for privacy, allowing participants to listen to the audio and select sections for removal. The web interface was designed to be convenient, as it would allow users to review transcripts and audio together, and indicate sections for removal through a simple form.\n\nHowever, others, including Professor E, suggested that paper printouts might be more convenient for some users, especially for those who prefer to leaf through a physical document. The concern was raised that making the bleeping process too easy could lead to excessive removals, potentially diminishing the value of the corpus for future research. There was a discussion about balancing user convenience with the need to preserve as much of the original dialogue as possible. Ultimately, the group seemed to lean towards providing both web-based and printout options, recognizing that different users have different preferences and needs.",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to cost concerns. An LCD screen required an advanced chip, which significantly increased the overall manufacturing price. The team wanted to maintain a target price point and felt that the added functionality of an LCD did not justify the additional expense. It was also discussed that an LCD screen on the remote may not be as useful, as it would only display limited information and require users to look down at the remote instead of at the television. The team prioritized other features and design elements to create a unique and marketable product within the budget.\n",
    "During the self-introduction, team members shared their names, roles (Project Manager, UI Designer, Industrial Designer, Marketing), and favorite animal, relating it to their role.\n\nThe project was introduced as designing a new remote control. Brainstorming involved discussing the remote's features, aiming for something original, trendy, and user-friendly. Ideas included a sleek, button-less design with a menu-based system and voice recognition. The team also considered high battery life and avoiding overly complex features.\n\nProject evaluation used criteria like ease of use, fashionability, feel, and technological innovation, rated on a seven-point scale. The prototype was assessed against these criteria.\n\nThe project process involved individual work followed by team meetings. The team reflected on creativity, individual leadership, teamwork, and technology used. There was discussion about the initial restriction to a TV remote and the balance between fashion and functionality. The team agreed that the project resulted in a desirable product.\n",
    "During the discussion on special features, the team considered adding rechargeable units to the device. The industrial designer mentioned that there was no rechargeable option available, so they looked at the standard double A and triple A batteries. They thought these were a bit bulky at the moment. Later in the discussion, a rechargeable concept was brought up again. The team discussed mobile phone batteries and how they last a long time. Also, the team discussed a charging base in which the remote could sit when not in use. This would ensure it's always charged. The project manager said that if the unit was rechargeable, then the consumer would not need to buy batteries again.",
    "The decision was made to standardize the microphones used in the meetings to address the variability in audio quality and ensure consistency for researchers working with the data. This includes getting more head-mounted microphones to standardize the microphone type, whether wired or wireless. The goal is to have all participants using the same microphone model, positioned consistently, to capture the best possible signal and minimize variations in audio quality across speakers. The change in microphone type will also help the transcribers, as Adam's microphone channel is consistently rated as the best due to the lack of breathing sounds.",
    "Meilyr Rowlands was not present at any of these meetings.\n\nKirsty Williams AM made several statements regarding the challenges faced by secondary schools, methods to ensure safety, support for students with emotional and mental health difficulties, and studying from home. Williams emphasized that schools would only move to a new phase of operation when it was safe to do so, based on advice from medical and scientific advisors. She highlighted the importance of considering the safety and well-being of children and staff, communicating clearly with parents and staff, and addressing practical challenges such as social distancing and school transport.\n\nRegarding safety, Williams mentioned the need for testing, tracing, and quarantining to be critical in the next phase. For emotional and mental health support, she acknowledged the pandemic's impact and announced additional funding for local authorities to increase services, including telephone and video support, and remote counseling. She also emphasized the importance of ongoing safeguarding of children at home, with referral mechanisms in place for teachers with concerns.\n\nWilliams also discussed the importance of hardware and internet connectivity for students studying from home.\n",
    "During the detailed design discussion of the spherical remote control, the Industrial Designer expressed several key thoughts and concerns. They acknowledged the need to balance the aesthetic design with functional requirements, pointing out that a ball shape might cause the remote to roll, necessitating a flat side for stability. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of sturdiness to withstand potential rough handling, such as being thrown by children. They also raised the question of product lifespan, considering whether the remote should be highly durable or designed for more frequent replacement. They also suggested that there should be a compromise between stability and design. They also stated that they are concerned with the look and feel of the product.\n",
    "The group's opinion on Erasmus and mobility funding for students is that they are committed to finding ways of promoting and resourcing mobility. They acknowledge the benefits and international recognition of the Erasmus program. While recognizing the potential loss of the Erasmus program due to Brexit, they see opportunities to encourage institutions to proactively fund their own mobility efforts, potentially supplementing any future arrangements.\n\nThere is no discussion of tuition fee refunds for students.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several topics. Petitions were presented concerning local authoritative frameworks, including treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, the Trans Mountain pipeline, firearms bans, conversion therapy, and organ harvesting.\n\nCondolences were offered to families who lost loved ones, including those who died at sea and prominent community members.\n\nEmployment was discussed in the context of the pandemic's impact on workers, especially those in tourism, small businesses, and the energy sector, with questions raised about the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and wage subsidy programs.\n\nWorkers' safety was a key concern, particularly in long-term care facilities, where reports of neglect and abuse were addressed. The deployment of the Canadian Armed Forces to these facilities and the need for national standards of care were discussed.\n\nPay dispute situations were mentioned in relation to essential workers, with a call for a wage supplement for those in contact with the public. There were also discussions about hazard pay for soldiers serving in long-term care facilities.",
    "During the meeting, specific thanks were expressed to the House of Commons and the Canadian Armed Forces for their contributions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister thanked the House of Commons for their work during the pandemic. Also, the Deputy Prime Minister noted the importance of the support of the Canadian Armed Forces, who are doing an important and excellent job in Quebec and Ontario today, right now. She stated that the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today at the request of the Province of Quebec to save the lives of seniors. She thought everyone should thank these people who are working for Canada, for Quebec, and who are doing an important and excellent job.\n",
    "The group discussed the functions, characters, and design requirements of a remote control, prioritizing ease of use. They agreed that the remote should be simple, easy to find when lost, and have a competitive advantage without being overly complex or taking too long to develop.\n\nThe functions of the remote control should be limited to the most frequently used ones, such as channel and volume control. Teletext was deemed unnecessary. They also discussed the possibility of a scroll wheel for channel surfing and volume control, but ultimately decided against it in favor of pushbuttons to keep costs down and simplify the design. The use of an on-screen menu that could be scrolled through using pushbuttons was also suggested.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion revolved around data collection methods to enhance user interface design, particularly for querying meeting recordings. Plans for the upcoming team meeting include trying out CrossPads for note-taking and capturing summaries to generate queries. There was discussion about whether to use summaries from a designated note-taker or to solicit multiple summaries from meeting participants. The team also considered recording summaries instead of writing them. Marketing's thoughts on repetitive strain injury were not discussed in this meeting. The group did not reflect on previous meetings or progress in this transcript.",
    "The lab tests found a production cost of fifteen point eight Euros, which the team later reduced. The group discussed the finder button on the base station and the possibility of a trigger button on the remote itself but decided against it.\n\nThe team discussed the design of the volume buttons. They considered triangular buttons but worried about misdirection. There was discussion of having volume written on the side with up and down arrows on the buttons. The team also considered fruit and vegetable shapes for the buttons, with a spongy feel to the material. They ultimately decided on a red apple shape for the standby button. They agreed to keep the button design simple and the labeling fairly simple.\n\nRegarding lighting adaptive options and market interests, the team agreed that the product should be marketable and have a good product at a fair price. They considered a lifetime guarantee on the product and discussed whether to go for a higher cost to maintain profit margins or lower the cost to increase market share. The team also talked about the possibility of making the unit upgradable in the future.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of data collection and analysis. Regarding DAT (presumably referring to the data itself), there were concerns about its quality and consistency, especially across different microphones and speakers. There was a desire to standardize microphone usage to improve signal quality and reduce variability for researchers focusing on dialogue or prosody.\n\nOn power cables, the team mentioned a need to order more of a specific microphone type and the potential for wireless options.\n\nCapturing subject intention was a key focus, particularly in the context of tourist navigation. The team aimed to differentiate between intentions such as \"viewing,\" \"entering,\" or \"approaching\" a landmark. Approaches considered included belief networks to infer intention from features extracted from language, discourse, and context. The team explored the use of image schemas (Source-Path-Goal) and cognitive linguistics to model intentions and extract relevant properties. Also under consideration was the use of SmartKom's M-3L structure to provide a base level of understanding.",
    "The group discussed the general specification and case design, focusing on incorporating fashion trends while maintaining functionality. Market research indicated a desire for a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use, with the first being the most important.\n\nThe group considered using fruit and vegetable themes for the design, but recognized the potential for rapid obsolescence due to changing trends. The team decided on using a rubber casing for a spongy feel. This was decided to be paired with a plastic shell for the main body. They also decided to move forward with changeable cases for the remote, which would be rubberized. The team discussed the materials, including plastic and titanium, and whether these materials would work with the changeable cases.\n",
    "Huw David's views on the Bill included the idea that if implemented carefully and with the right resources, there should be no unintended consequences. He stressed the importance of resources being made available for social services and children's social services.\n\nRegarding legislation in light of changing natural behavior and culture, Huw David stated that the state's paramount role is to protect children from harm, referencing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. He said that physical punishment is harmful and should be prevented. He believes children can be raised without physical punishment.\n\nFinally, he did not explicitly state whether it should be included in the Bill, but he did emphasize the importance of clarity for vulnerable children who are being seriously assaulted and abused, which is covered by existing legislation.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the design and functionality of the two-sided remote control.\n\n**Design & Functionality:** There was consideration to have a flip-top design with standard buttons on top for frequently used functions and more complex buttons underneath. A GUI interface with icons or a touchpad was proposed for the flip side. The shape was discussed, with ideas ranging from a shell-like design to a banana shape for ergonomic purposes. There was also discussion around the type of buttons to use, including touch screens, rubber buttons, and bare PCB circuit boards.\n\n**Evaluation & Market Range:** Market research indicated that a \"fancy look and feel\" was the most important aspect for consumers, followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The group considered fruit and vegetable-inspired designs and spongy materials to align with current fashion trends. There was a discussion about targeting different age groups and markets with potentially different designs and ergonomics.\n\n**Technical Requirements:** The group discussed various technical aspects, including power sources (batteries, solar charging, kinetic charging), the type of chip needed for the L_C_D_ display, and the use of infrared signals. Concerns were raised about the durability of solar cells and the battery life of kinetic charging. The possibility of a rechargeable remote with a charging dock was also explored. Shock-proof and waterproof capabilities were not explicitly discussed.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not contain any discussions or opinions on amendments in group 3 regarding the regulation-making powers in the Bill, nor do they mention Suzy Davies' views on amendment 3A. The transcripts focus on the Crown Prosecution Service's views on the Bill in general and groups 1 and 2, which concern public awareness and reporting on the effects of the legislation.\n",
    "Brexit's impact on Welsh higher education institutions primarily revolves around funding and student enrollment. A decrease in EU student applications has been observed, attributed to changes in student support arrangements, making Wales less financially attractive compared to England. Executives are addressing the challenges by promoting Wales as a safe and supportive place to study through the \"Study in Wales\" program, focusing on marketing the unique strengths of Welsh institutions and working with the UK government to maintain access to research funding. They are also actively planning for various scenarios by considering fee and access plans and working with the Welsh Government HE Brexit working group.\n\nThe transcripts do not contain questioning or updates on the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks, nor do they mention projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal several key points regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada.\n\nThere is concern about elder abuse and neglect in long-term care facilities, with calls for national standards of care and increased government support for seniors. The Canadian Armed Forces have been involved in providing support and reporting on the conditions in these facilities.\n\nThere are calls to increase Old Age Security benefits and the Guaranteed Income Supplement, as well as the New Horizons for Seniors program, to address the isolation of seniors.\n\nThe government has announced a one-time, tax-free payment for seniors eligible for OAS and GIS, as well as funding to expand the New Horizons for Seniors program.\n\nThe government is providing significant resources to shelters to house homeless people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, with a goal of cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade.\n",
    "The marketing expert emphasizes the importance of the remote's aesthetics and user-friendliness. She highlights that consumers find current remotes unattractive and are willing to pay more for a visually appealing alternative. Her research indicates that ease of use is paramount, with a focus on frequently used functions like volume and channel control.\n\nShe also notes the appeal of voice recognition is inversely related to age and that the team should be mindful of repetitive strain injuries (RSI) in the design. Ultimately, the marketing expert believes the remote should be fashionable, simple to use, and not an eyesore on a coffee table. She suggests defining the target demographic by their spending habits, not necessarily their age.\n",
    "The main points discussed regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act included the universal adoption of the Act to protect children's rights and ensure they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. The advantages focused on clarifying the law for parents and those working with children, promoting positive parenting, and aligning with international human rights standards. Weaknesses and concerns raised included the potential for increased workload for social services, the need for a comprehensive awareness campaign, addressing malicious reporting, ensuring adequate support for parents, and the impact on public services.\n",
    "The group discussed the evaluation criteria for a belief-net simulator, focusing on its application to path planning. They began by identifying key decision nodes, such as \"Go-there,\" and explored factors influencing them. The discussion highlighted the need to represent user preferences, situational constraints, and discourse cues within the belief net.\n\nThe team considered how to incorporate the ontology, with properties like \"exhibiting\" or \"selling,\" into the belief net. They explored linking user models, ontologies, and discourse to endpoint decisions via intermediate nodes.\n\nThe team also explored the relationship between the endpoint decision (enter, view, approach) and the \"Go-there\" decision, suggesting that the endpoint influences the situational \"Go-there\" node. They emphasized the importance of avoiding loops in the belief net structure to ensure proper computation and convergence.\n",
    "The participants did not discuss using CD's for backup. They did discuss the probability computation of the Bayes-net. It was determined that testing every output node would be impossible due to the number of permutations needed. One participant calculated that it would take billions of seconds. They agreed that probabilistically it would be good enough.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system consists of participants being placed in a room with a 3D model or QuickTime animation of a square in Heidelberg. Participants are told of a computer system that can tell them everything they want to know. They are given tasks to solve by picking up a phone and dialing a number. After three tasks, the system crashes and a human operator apologizes and urges them to continue with the same tasks, but with different objects. The participants are told that the computer system knows exactly where they are via GPS.\n",
    "The group decided against symmetrical buttons on both sides because of ergonomic considerations, as the initial design was more geared towards right-handed users. The marketing team suggested that users could learn to use either hand. However, the user interface team pointed out that if they made both right- and left-handed versions, it would score a one, otherwise a two.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating separate right- and left-handed remotes. The user interface team was open to the idea, but the marketing team questioned the practicality of a household needing two remotes if there were both left- and right-handed individuals in the family. The industrial designer thought it wouldn't be too difficult to use the remote with either hand and suggested they could offer both versions. Ultimately, the Project Manager seemed to consider it a good idea but didn't commit to pursuing it.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed cost reduction strategies to meet their budget of 12.50 Euros. Initially, the prototype cost was at 13.70 Euros. They considered abandoning features like voice recognition (sample sensor and speaker) and kinetic energy to reduce costs, but they ultimately decided to keep the voice recognition feature because of its appeal.\n\nTo lower production costs, the team explored using standard materials for the buttons, reserving special materials (rubber, wood, titanium) for only one button (the red apple). This was aimed at minimizing the \"button supplement\" cost. The team also discussed the possibility of using hard plastic instead of rubber for the case to save money and potentially align better with the company's corporate identity. They also considered removing the special colors for the buttons, keeping them all the same color.\n\nUltimately, the team agreed to switch to a plastic case, which allowed them to retain technical innovations like voice recognition while staying within budget. They also discussed the possibility of using a different shape for one of the buttons to maintain some \"fanciness\" and \"fashionability\" after switching to a plastic case.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the pros of voice recognition are that it can provide a baseline for understanding the data, the transcripts are very good, and the XML conversion to waveforms is automated. Additionally, the recognizer can be within a reasonable scope of Switchboard. It can also be helpful for transcribers by clearing up hearings that involve overlaps.\n\nThe cons include that the language model for Switchboard is totally different, so there are a fair number of errors, especially with proper nouns and specialized vocabulary. Lapel mikes can negatively impact recognition. The voice recognition system may also produce incorrect XML files and non-monotonic sync times. Furthermore, there can be an acoustic glitch where the channels get slightly asynchronized.",
    "The discussion on battery options involved several ideas, with the Industrial Designer weighing in on each. Rechargeable options were deemed unavailable. Standard AA and AAA batteries were considered too bulky. Dynamo charging (wind-up) was dismissed as impractical. Solar charging was considered, but the designer noted that solar cells would need to be on the case and are not very resistant to dropping. Kinetic charging, like in wristwatches, was considered more viable, as the constant movement would charge a small internal cell, but the Project Manager questioned if there would be enough movement to charge the remote.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a long-term battery source for simplicity of manufacturing and maintenance. They assumed people would change the remote due to fashion before the battery runs out, aiming for a battery life of at least 5-10 years.\n\nThe Industrial Designer did not recommend a charger for the industrial working design.\n",
    "The reasons for including the project in a conference paper were multifaceted. One primary reason was to document the work done on the Bayes-net and SUDO-square (Situation, User, Discourse, Ontology) framework. This documentation was seen as valuable regardless of whether the paper was accepted, as it would provide a record of the team's progress and ideas.\n\nThe conference paper also offered an opportunity to introduce the new formalism being developed by the team, even if it was not yet fully complete. By focusing on a specific example, such as the \"where is X?\" construction, the paper could showcase the potential of the formalism and how it could be applied to natural language understanding.\n\nAdditionally, the conference provided a chance to engage with the broader research community and receive feedback on the project. The interdisciplinary nature of the conference, encompassing cognitive, neural, psycho-linguistic, and computer science perspectives, made it an ideal forum for presenting the team's work and exploring its connections to other fields.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams did not explicitly state her thoughts on the funding allocated to the consortia. However, she did mention that there are some regional consortia services that have performed really highly, and others that need to improve.\n\nRegarding university governance, Kirsty Williams noted that the HE Act does not directly address the issue, but HEFCW has assurance practices. She has sought a more direct relationship with university chairs and is supportive of the independent review of governance being undertaken by Universities Wales and HEFCW. She is exploring how the PCET Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance.\n\nKirsty Williams stated that she does not have a burning desire to pursue university mergers, but is in favor of a healthy, strong, and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or merge, that is a matter for them.\n\nThe meeting transcript did not explicitly address the discussions about admission problems in Welsh universities and the proposed solutions.\n",
    "The team explored various aspects of a remote control design, including the energy source, technological innovations, and overall design. Initially, the team favored a solar cell with a backup battery for the energy source, highlighting the environmental theme. However, due to budget constraints, they decided to remove the solar cell and backup battery, opting for a standard battery.\n\nRegarding technological innovation, the team emphasized voice recognition as a key feature to differentiate their product, targeting a younger market. Despite its appeal, voice recognition was also cut due to budget limitations.\n\nThe team evaluated different shapes and button layouts, ultimately leaning towards the \"potato\" prototype. They considered factors like functionality, ease of use, and aesthetic appeal, with a focus on incorporating spongy textures and vibrant colors. The team also assessed the minimization of repetitive strain injury (RSI) and the inclusion of a corporate logo.",
    "**Technical Issues:** The group discussed the performance of neck-mounted microphones and the VU meter's potential contribution to errors. They also touched upon the difficulty of correcting errors versus starting from scratch in transcription and the need for accurate timing.\n\n**Energy Source:** There was a brief discussion about fan noise affecting data and whether to turn off the auxiliary fan, potentially leading to short meetings due to carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n**Project Announcement Email:** The group mentioned receiving a funny email saying the moderator would send the joint thing to send, which was \"MMTG RCDR hyphen joint\". It was revealed that the setup was at UW and not on their side.\n\n**Sample Sensor:** The group discussed the difficulty of accurately capturing speech events due to masking and normalization issues in mixed close-talking mikes. They considered using a combination of close-talking mikes to capture interruptions and using distant mikes to find all instances of overlap.\n",
    "The last meeting covered several key areas and challenges. The transcription status was reviewed, including progress with IBM and ICSI. It was noted that IBM was slow in returning transcriptions, potentially leaving ICSI transcribers idle. A web page tracking transcription progress was mentioned and will be circulated. Participant approval for transcripts and audio access was discussed.\n\nDisk space limitations were a major concern, with scratch disks nearing capacity. Solutions like using space on newly acquired SUN Blades or utilizing available space on individual computers were considered. There was a discussion on contacting Dave, the system administrator, to address the long-term disk space needs.\n\nThe meeting also addressed the IBM transcription process. It was decided to compare the hand-marked transcriptions with those generated by Thilo's process to identify any significant differences. The use of accurate time marks for speech segments was emphasized. The topic of backchannels and their impact on discourse analysis was discussed.",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns about the Welsh Government's childcare offer. They questioned the \u00a34.50 single national rate, fearing it could lead to a two-tiered system where wealthier parents could afford better care through add-ons. They were worried about the affordability for lowest-income working families, who might struggle with the extra costs for food, transport, and other consumables.\n\nThey also discussed the uneven intensity of demand across different areas and how pilot programs in Cardiff and Newport might reveal capacity problems with the \u00a34.50 rate. Concerns were raised about the qualification and quality of the workforce and whether there would be sufficient capacity growth in the next few years to deliver the offer, particularly in Welsh-medium settings. Finally, they addressed the administrative burden on local authorities and parents in proving eligibility for the scheme.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line and phase normalization began with PhD C explaining his work on on-line normalization, including training with different means for silence and speech, and using a time constant that adapts to utterances. The professor suggested analyzing the types of errors to understand how these changes affect performance. PhD F mentioned trying phase normalization with long-term mean subtraction but got poor results. Grad G also experimented with phase normalization, trying phase unwrapping, but got worse results. He suggested working with complex numbers and dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of using logarithms and subtraction. The professor did not comment on phase normalization, and the transcripts do not mention any discussion between the professor and PhD C on quals.",
    "The discussion started with the idea of detecting important linguistic features using narrow band information for phonetic features. One approach discussed involved a multi-band system using an OR gate at a higher level and AND gates at the lowest level for detecting the presence of sonorance in sub-bands. The advantage of using Noisy-ORs is that they are trained explicitly for a product of errors rule, which is what Fletcher observed in the twenties.\n\nRegarding the inclusion in the transcription formalization, there was also a discussion on what the targets should be trained for in the intermediate stages, rather than directly aiming for small sound units. The group considered what features would distinguish words from one another. John Ohala felt stress was a good feature to mark, and that human annotators should be able to reliably mark features such as nasality. The group also discussed how to measure the performance of the detector and the confusions between sonorant and non-sonorant sounds.\n",
    "The discussion on system involvement in demos involved using THISL tools for information retrieval, including indexing and querying tools. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface, possibly merging Transcriber and THISL IR, with features like speaker-based queries. Demos were planned to showcase the speech/non-speech work and prosody features.\n\nRegarding backups, Dave Johnson advised against using non-backed-up disks, recommending manual archiving and backups for redundancy. The group discussed the timing between getting more disks and recording meetings.\n\nCollecting notes involved the use of CrossPads for note-taking, but there were concerns about the noise of the pen and the infrastructure required for synchronization and data format conversion. Other ideas were discussed like the use of PDAs with wireless cards for marking events.\n\nGoing forward, Professor B wanted to schedule periods where people go over something later and put some kind of summary or something. However, Professor B liked the idea of agendas being sent out to meeting participants. Professor E wanted a day before the meeting to send out the agendas.\n",
    "The discussion about the issues with HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) stemmed from the Welsh Government's previous plan to partner with them to deliver the childcare offer. However, this plan was suspended due to concerns that HMRC's system would restrict the flexibility and potential expansion of the offer. Julie Morgan stated that it was a \"principle decision\" based on the desire for a more flexible and expandable offer rather than technical issues. There were also concerns about HMRC's ability to fully meet Welsh language standards, although the committee had previously been assured that HMRC would not have any problems delivering to those standards. Morgan suggested that going through HMRC would put limits on the childcare offer. Ultimately, the Welsh Government decided to explore alternative delivery methods to ensure greater flexibility and control over the program's development.\n",
    "Professor D commented on the workshop, noting that there was another thing going on of gathering data. The team did not comment on anyone in Grenada.\nRegarding the new form arrangement, the professor wanted to add a line for participants to initial, indicating they did not want to see the final transcript.\nThe suggested structure of the belief net involved nodes with multiple inputs, representing cues for an effect (e.g., final action). Intermediate nodes would represent the probability distribution if all other cues were in a \"distinguished\" (default) state.\nGrad B did not comment on the belief net structure.\n",
    "Grad A and Grad E had differing views on the goals of their experiments. Grad A focused on a pragmatic interpretation of the \"where is X?\" construction, emphasizing whether the construction was semantically ambiguous or clearly location-based but pragmatically construed as a request for directions.\n\nGrad E, on the other hand, was more concerned with the implementation and integration of various knowledge sources, such as ontology and discourse history, to infer the user's intent. Grad E wanted to incorporate the knowledge from discourse history to influence the probabilities of entering a location.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) designer emphasized the company motto, \"Put the fashion in electronics,\" advocating for trendy and fashionable designs. They favored simple, organic designs with fewer buttons, capitalizing on the fact that users often only utilize a small percentage of available buttons. The UI designer suggested features like glow-in-the-dark material for visibility in low-light conditions.\n\nInitially, the UI team considered a TFT display for advanced functionality. However, concerns about cost, durability, and complexity led to the rejection of this feature. Speech recognition was also considered for locating the remote but ultimately scrapped due to potential interference issues, cost, and development time.\n\nThe final decision was to prioritize simplicity and ease of use. The design would incorporate a minimal number of buttons, focusing on essential functions like channel selection, volume control, and power. A backlight on the wheel was decided upon to assist in the dark. The remote would have a corporate color scheme with the company slogan integrated. This design aimed to balance functionality with a trendy aesthetic while staying within budget.\n",
    "The professor believes that spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering are fundamentally the same, differing mainly in mathematical exponents, and that the choice between them is less significant than other factors. These factors include over-subtraction adjustments, smoothing techniques, and whether to operate on Mel bands or FFT bins. After the noise reduction, a neural net can operate on the output or the original. \n\nThe professor emphasizes the importance of noise estimation and suggests a compromise between relying solely on the initial frames and depending on pauses. They also noted that Guenter's argument is that averaging over the whole signal, even with a good VAD, is not ideal because it combines stationary and non-stationary noise. Ultimately, the goal is to have a system that works well in general, not just for specific evaluations.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function as a device to send commands to a television set, including basic functions like power, channel, volume, and mute. The user interface should be intuitive and user-focused, prioritizing channel control and volume.\n\nThe possibility of a kinetic energy source was discussed, where the remote is powered by movement. This would require the user to \"throw it between your hands every now and then\" to maintain power. \n\nThe idea of a joystick for channel and volume control was also explored, with the default functions being up and down for volume and left and right for channels. The user interface could be simplified by using an LCD screen for additional functionality and menu navigation, potentially mimicking a mobile phone interface. A \"rolling\" function through favorite channels was not specifically mentioned, but the discussion of channel selection and joystick control implies the ability to navigate channels easily.\n",
    "The team's proposed design for implementing demographic marketing strategies includes a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, and incorporation of current fashion trends, such as a spongy texture and fruit and vegetable-inspired design colors. The Industrial Designer and Marketing agreed to present appearance designs, with the Industrial Designer proposing a product marketing plan focusing on customization and the use of exotic woods for the remote control case.\n\nMarketing expressed that the design should minimize R_S_I_ and be easy to locate, with a preference for voice recognition or a beeper function. Marketing also felt that the customizability was a good gimmick. The team agreed to explore the cost of adding a display and to develop a prototype based on these concepts.\n",
    "Grad G and the professor shared opinions on several key aspects of the project. Regarding capturing subject intention, both believed it was crucial, with Grad G suggesting a table layout to categorize intentions and the professor emphasizing the need to discern parameters influencing choices. On MSG (presumably referring to message generation), there's no explicit mention of opinions, but the discussion on the system's responses suggests a focus on generating relevant and informative messages. The transcripts do not contain information about pronouncing zero. As for hiring Fey, the professor seemed supportive, highlighting Fey's potential contribution to dialogue design.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer expressed that the appearance design should be fancy because consumers are willing to pay more for good-looking products. In terms of technology, they noted the potential for a simple speech recognition chip within the remote control, costing around five Euros or less. This chip would be trained for a particular user, recognizing basic commands like \"volume up/down\" and channel numbers. However, the Industrial Designer was concerned about the cost and complexity of incorporating new technologies, especially features like automatic on/off and volume control based on distance, given the target price range.\n",
    "The discussions on the priority of inspections focused on prioritizing refugee claimant files, especially those from Haitian and Black communities. The reopening of the House of Commons was discussed in relation to the need for Parliament to resume its functions, including debate and holding the government to account. There was a call for Parliament to reopen while maintaining public health guidelines.\n\nJassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders' agreement on the priority of inspections is not mentioned in the text.\n\nJustin Trudeau elaborated on the governmental fund, emphasizing the need to leverage private capital for infrastructure projects through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. He defended the bank's mandate and the remuneration of its former CEO. His thoughts on the revolution in national institutions are not mentioned in the text.\n",
    "The group discussed the technical and functional designs of the remote control, focusing on user requirements and market trends. The industrial designer presented a prototype with a plastic body, customizable faces, and a black and white touchscreen. The prototype featured kinetic batteries and a voice recognition system for locating the remote.\n\nThe user interface designer emphasized minimizing buttons and creating a sleek, simple design. The marketing expert highlighted the need for a fancy look and feel, ease of use, and incorporation of current fashion trends, such as a spongy texture and fruit/vegetable-inspired colors.\n\nSpecific design requirements included minimizing repetitive strain injury (RSI) and making the remote easy to locate. While voice recognition was favored, a beeper function was also considered. The group evaluated the prototype against these criteria, assigning ratings for each aspect. They also discussed the feasibility of incorporating voice recognition, considering cost and market demand. Ultimately, they aimed for a balance between functionality, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed and evaluated their project's process, work division, and production plan, focusing on a TV remote prototype. The industrial designer presented the physical aspects, including button design, curvature for ergonomics, and labeling, while the user interface designer addressed the user experience.\n\nThe team evaluated the prototype against criteria like ease of use, fashionability, and technological innovation, using a seven-point scale. They debated the prototype's \"feel,\" voice recognition capabilities, and overall trendiness.\n\nThe project manager guided a discussion on budget, materials (lithium vs. AAA batteries), and components, aiming to stay under a \u20ac12.50 limit. They explored the possibility of voice sensor, integrated scroll-wheel or push-button.\n\nThe team reflected on the project's creative freedom, teamwork, and technological resources. While the industrial designer felt initially restricted, the marketing team member praised the team's control over technological advancement and fashion aspects. They acknowledged challenges with digital pens and network sharing but found the overall process positive. The team finally decided to remove the voice recognition feature to meet the budget and recommend a higher budget for future products.\n",
    "The discussion on future directions focused on several key areas. The group explored using CrossPads for note-taking, but handwriting recognition limitations were noted. They considered recording summaries and the potential for user-interface design improvements based on data collection. The group also talked about the difficulties of gathering queries from people after meetings.\n\nPhD D explained the multilingual model, discussing the use of TI-digits, Italian, French, and Finnish tasks. The goal was to analyze feature, training data, and test data dimensions using neural networks. The possibility of using the OGI language ID corpus was raised, but concerns about the acoustic mismatch with telephone speech were discussed.\n\nPhD C and the professor discussed the importance of multiple languages in training data, especially for producing discriminative features. They considered training nets on a range of languages and testing on target languages. The potential for training on articulatory features for cross-language applicability was also explored.\n\nThe group discussed releasing meeting data and allowing people to cut things out. They acknowledged the need for standards for transcription and considered potential collections at Columbia and UW. They also looked at the possibility of having Dan Ellis modify Transcriber to better preserve overlaps.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement about the gap between program development and its implementation highlights a critical issue in the project. She observes that while a program or tool might be theoretically sound or even functional in a controlled setting, its practical application and effectiveness can significantly differ when deployed in real-world scenarios. This gap can stem from various factors such as unforeseen complexities in the data, user-related issues, or integration challenges with existing systems. Her remark underscores the importance of not only developing a robust program but also thoroughly testing and adapting it to ensure its usability and efficiency in diverse contexts.\n",
    "The Project Manager had mixed feelings about the last meeting review and market research. They felt that the designers were able to have quite a lot of creative input, but the guidelines were fairly contrived. The Project Manager thought the designs were overly basic. They also felt that the meetings were more brainstorming sessions than actual meetings.\n\nWhen reflecting on the meetings and project progress, the Project Manager thought that the leadership style was too controlling, and that the team tasks were too divided. They also thought that the tools provided were fancy but didn't support collaboration.\n\nThe group had a different opinion than the Project Manager. They felt that the creativity was more of a formality than actual creativity. They also felt that the environment was not conducive to creative thought. The group thought the leadership was fairly strong, but it turned the individual into more of a predetermined mechanism, as opposed to a free project. The group felt that they could not communicate outside the meeting, which made teamwork difficult.\n\nThe group did not discuss using a panther as a drawing.",
    "The team had varying thoughts on the remote control's features. There was a consensus that users generally don't like the look and feel of most remote controls on the market. The marketing expert's research indicated that a younger demographic was interested in an LCD screen and speech recognition, while older users were less keen.\n\nThe industrial designer was open to an LCD screen but expressed concern about the cost and feasibility of speech recognition. They also mentioned that users prioritize the look and feel and the trendiness above all else. The user interface designer emphasized ergonomics and a simple design with fewer buttons, suggesting that the design could compensate for fewer buttons. They proposed a glow-in-the-dark feature as a gimmick.\n\nThe project manager suggested a small joystick and LCD, drawing inspiration from mobile phones for menu navigation. They also raised concerns about power consumption and the potential for user confusion with multiple screens. The team also discussed the microphone position.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries weakened the domestic market and impacted the fishing industry, which relies on these sectors. The government took several measures to mitigate the impact on various sectors, including agriculture and fisheries. For the fishing industry, the government recognized the challenges faced by fishers and committed to working with the industry and coastal communities to ensure their future. Financial support was provided, including $62.5 million for freezing products. For the broader economy, the government introduced measures like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy to support workers and businesses. Additionally, investments were made in infrastructure projects to stimulate economic recovery.\n",
    "The design of the remote control focused on user-friendliness, simplicity, and a modern aesthetic. The team decided on a traditional rectangular shape but aimed to subtly \"trick\" consumers into perceiving it as new and sleek through color and shape variations, potentially inspired by fruit or vegetable themes. The energy source will be a basic battery, deemed the most practical option.\n\nComponent-wise, the team explored materials like plastic, rubber, and titanium for the outer shell. The final decision was plastic with rubber grips. The user interface was a key point of discussion, with a preference for minimal buttons and a scroll wheel similar to an iPod. This would require a more sophisticated and expensive chip-on-print. The team also explored incorporating an LCD screen, but this was deemed too expensive. The final design will feature a plastic case with rubber grips, pushbuttons, and an iPod-style scroll wheel. The team will now work on a prototype.\n",
    "The meeting discussed the DARPA demo and the goal of having 20 hours of transcribed data available ASAP. The IBM transcription status was reviewed, and a new beep format was implemented to help transcribers align the audio with the transcripts. A subset of digits has been transcribed, and forced alignment was suggested.\n\nA paper describing the system proposed for the Aurora challenge was mentioned, including the online normalization. The paper will be presented in Aalborg, Denmark. Experiments with online normalization using two different means (one for silence and one for speech) and a time constant that adapts to the beginning of utterances were discussed. There was also discussion regarding adding noise to smooth the MFCC. Statistics from the paper were not explicitly discussed.",
    "The group agreed to analyze the digits corpus along three dimensions: feature, training data, and test data. They planned to use the TI-digit task, as well as Italian, French, and Finnish tasks. They would use neural networks trained on both the task data and, if possible, data from the same language but from a more generic phonetically balanced database. The current technique involves using mel cepstra, but the group is also exploring PLP, MSG, and JRASTA features.\n\nLimitations of the current approach include the potential mismatch between training and testing conditions, especially regarding noise and acoustic environments. The group discussed the importance of including multiple languages in the training data and whether to use hand-labeled or automatically derived phone labels.\n\nProgress includes re-installing HTK, working on labels for TIMIT, and training neural networks on various databases. The group is also working on converting alignments into label files for training.\n\nDelays are attributed to resource issues such as disk space limitations and the availability of machines for training. The group also faced challenges in setting up the infrastructure and addressing the complexity of combining different features and languages. The absence of key personnel, such as Jane and Dave, also contributed to delays in transcription and disk management.\n",
    "In the meetings, the advantage of \"triple R\" over \"triple RC\" wasn't mentioned because the focus was on functional design, user requirements, and target audience rather than specific name options for the product.\n\nThe conclusion regarding the target age group was initially leaning towards 15-35 year olds due to their interest in voice recognition and disposable income. However, the team later considered defining the target group by objectives like fashion and simplicity rather than specific age demographics. This was because a broad age range was determined to be a better target.\n\nThe marketing team's decision to target young people stemmed from the company's vision of \"fashion in electronics,\" which is more likely to attract a younger demographic. Also, it was assumed that this group has more disposable income for technology.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection focused on simplifying the remote control and prioritizing essential functions like volume and channel control. The team considered categorizing controls into habitual, frequently used functions and less accessible, advanced features. The team decided not to include teletext, and to focus solely on television control rather than including VCR or DVD functionality.\n",
    "The group's market research indicated that current remote controls are considered ugly and frustrating to use. Eighty percent of users are willing to spend more on a fancier looking remote. Younger users are interested in voice recognition, but older users are not. Desired features discussed included a streamlined design with fewer buttons, with emphasis on power, channel, and volume. There was also discussion of a hidden or slide-out panel for less frequently used buttons.\n\nDesign opinions varied, with some favoring a simple, user-friendly design and others wanting something technologically advanced. Ideas included speech recognition, a long-lasting energy source, and a reliable infra-red signal.\n\nThe necessity of revolution in remote control interaction was debated. Some felt it was essential to create a completely new experience, focusing on simplicity and fashion. Others were more cautious, suggesting a balance between conventional design and novel ideas. The idea of a \"find my remote\" feature was also discussed, as was a charging station to keep the remote in a consistent spot.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM emphasized the importance of co-construction with the profession in the plan for quality assurance, utilizing quality improvement practitioners in workshops to refine the curriculum based on feedback. Bethan Owen highlighted the high-risk category. Kirsty Williams AM outlined five principles: support for change, a purpose-led curriculum, greater professional autonomy, language clarification, and simplification with more depth where needed. Expectations for new examinations and school qualifications were to ensure breadth and statutory framework for progression, including mental health. In response to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions, Kirsty Williams AM stressed that they were listening to concerns and taking steps to address them, emphasizing that practitioners, guided by experts, were developing the \"what matters\" statements.\n",
    "The team had mixed feelings about the production process. They appreciated the teamwork and individual leadership opportunities. They also liked the shared network and wireless laptops. The digital pens were fun, although their usefulness was questioned. \n\nHowever, the team felt stifled creatively by the company's initial restriction to only using a TV remote design. Some team members also expressed concerns about the fruit-shaped design, with one person stating they couldn't \"swallow the fruit.\" Additionally, the user interface expert didn't like PowerPoint presentations and felt that some of the information available was not helpful.\n",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments primarily revolves around its implementation and effectiveness within the SmartKom system. Grad E tested mean log magnitude spectral subtraction using past and present frames to calculate the mean, finding a slight performance drop compared to a centered window. Professor C explored the impact of varying time lengths for mean calculation during training and testing, noting that mismatched training and testing lengths hurt performance, but not significantly.\n\nA key question arose: does the time used to calculate the mean during training matter? Professor C suggested viewing mean cepstral subtraction as a filter, potentially limiting its capabilities. The group also discussed whether to neglect silence regions when calculating the mean. Professor C proposed a dynamic approach, building up the mean over time. A second-pass approach was suggested, using a simpler mechanism initially and then refining the results with a longer time version of mean subtraction.\n",
    "The discussion covered several topics. Mixed signals arose regarding the benefits of feature analysis versus sticking to previously successful methods for speaker change detection. Regarding VAD, the Munich system with Gaussian mixtures was used for speech/non-speech detection, with improvements noted when distinguishing between loud and quiet speakers. However, this method struggles with overlaps. The VAD results showed a 14% improvement over the baseline, while Sunil's VAD achieved over 20%. Postdoc A mentioned that the new headphones were horrible and uncomfortable. Alternative methods to increase space included modifying the interface or finding existing tools, with musical score notation being considered ideal. Finally, the immediate deadline was to get eleven hours of transcription completed by the end of the month.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, special schools are not explicitly discussed within the context of the new purpose arrangement or their role in relation to schools with PDG for looked-after children or regional consortia. The focus is primarily on mainstream schools and the allocation and use of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged pupils, particularly those eligible for free school meals and looked-after children.\n\nHowever, there is a discussion on the broader approach to using the looked-after children PDG, with some consortia using it as part of a broader strategy targeted at vulnerable learners in general. This could potentially include children in special schools, but it is not explicitly stated.\n",
    "The prototype of the remote control was introduced by User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager in the form of three different clay models. The first was held in the left or right hand and had buttons that could be pushed with the thumb or index finger. The second model was called the rhombus. The third model was called the potato, which was an ergonomic shape that fit nicely in the hand. It had red buttons for changing channels, a middle button to bring up the on-screen menu, and four other buttons to navigate the menu system.\n\nTo make the remote universal, the team discussed interoperability, so that one remote control could control one or more pieces of equipment. They also talked about different ways of communicating with the equipment, such as infrared and Bluetooth. The remote was intended to work on different TVs and devices, and not be specific to one vendor. It should fit every device and be sold to a broad public.\n",
    "During the discussion about the design and evaluation of the prototype, the Industrial Designer focused on the appearance and structure of the device. The designer suggested a plastic body with a neutral color like white or light blue, along with customizable colors and patterns for a wide choice of personalization. The top LCD screen would be inset, and the bottom screen would contain standard buttons.\n\nRegarding the internal structure, the designer mentioned kinetic batteries that could potentially attach to the flipping mechanism. They also mentioned that two separate PCBs would be joined at the hinge with cabling. The infrared sender would be located on the bottom layer.\n\nIn terms of customer preferences, the Industrial Designer mentioned fashion and putting it back into electronics. They also talked about voice recognition and how it would be fairly easy to get a-hold of.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, there is no mention of the allocation of $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking or a solution to risk appetite. However, the transcripts do provide insight into Hon. Chrystia Freeland's perspective on systemic racism.\n\nHon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges that systemic racism, unconscious bias, and anti-black racism are real issues in Canada. She emphasizes the importance of disaggregated data, including race-based data, to better understand and address the impact of issues like COVID-19 on different communities. Furthermore, she states the government will always work to uphold the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and ensure the human rights of everyone in Canada are protected. She also highlights that the RCMP is guided by bias-free policing based on equality and non-discrimination.\n",
    "The segmenter is working well, with Thilo's segmenter being specifically mentioned. It has high recall, which is beneficial because over-generation allows for the training of noise models in the recognizer for transients. The pre-segmentations are considered extremely helpful to the transcribers. A sample meeting was sent to the transcribers with Thilo's segmentation run, in order to see if it fixed the problem with too many beeps in the last transcription. The goal is to be in production mode by the DARPA meeting in July.",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface designer and the Industrial Designer disagreed on the price because the User Interface designer believed that the cost of programming the menus and the price of materials should be included in the overall cost, while the Industrial Designer thought it would be cheap to develop. The User Interface designer disagreed with the redesign after product evaluation because there was no redesign time, which they believed would lead to the product flopping if the users did not like the design.\n\nThe User Interface designer suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because yellow was one of the company colors, and red would make the power button very prominent.\n\nThe meeting transcripts did not mention a disagreement between the marketing team and the User Interface designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance.\n",
    "Kay Martin and Nick Brazil share similar opinions. Both believe that employers are primarily interested in the core qualifications and skills related to specific professions (e.g., engineering qualifications, literacy, numeracy, and digital skills). They find that employers don't often mention or understand the Welsh bac, and that there are other programs that engage employers better. Nick Brazil adds that the Welsh bac has become a rigorous qualification that puts a lot of pressure on students and staff. He questions whether it is developing the skills that employers require. Dafydd Evans agrees that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac and its value, suggesting that the title itself is unhelpful.\n",
    "The team presented a prototype remote control with a plastic body, potentially in a neutral color like white or light blue. The remote features customizable faces with a wide array of colors and patterns. It includes a black and white touch screen, kinetic batteries, and a voice recognition system. Standard buttons for volume and channel control are also present. The team also considered a bezeled or engraved logo.\n\nAdditional ideas included the incorporation of a snail image for marketing and a desire to reach the market before the competition. A strong emphasis was placed on a biomorphic shape, soft feel, and overall functionality. The team discussed showing the prototype to various age and socioeconomic groups and presenting it to consumer research groups.\n",
    "The Project Manager's thoughts on the remote control's market range, price issues, and target groups were centered around balancing cost constraints with desired features and market reach. They emphasized the need to meet the four million sales target. While open to new features like speech recognition, they questioned the feasibility of including them within the budget and whether the target market for such features was large enough to justify the investment.\n\nRegarding the new features proposed by Marketing, the Project Manager was cautious, particularly about speech recognition. They acknowledged its appeal to younger demographics but raised concerns about its practicality and cost-effectiveness. The Project Manager also expressed reservations about the multipurpose remote control, likely due to budget constraints. They underscored the importance of setting a selling target and identifying the appropriate target market group to align with the corporate image, color, and slogan. The Project Manager also was concerned that the Teletext was outdated.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) had several thoughts regarding the cost constraints, financial targets, and the replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project.\n\nFirstly, UI initially favored titanium for the remote's casing due to its minimalist and shiny aesthetic, drawing inspiration from iPods. However, they acknowledged that titanium might be too expensive and futuristic, especially when trying to maintain a colorful and organic design in line with the company's colors.\n\nRegarding energy sources, UI initially found the kinetic energy source attractive, as it would make the remote lighter and more convenient. However, they also recognized the importance of cost and development considerations. UI expressed concern that a kinetic energy source may not be appropriate as watching TV is often a sedentary activity. Ultimately, UI seemed to agree with using kinetic energy if it was at all possible.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding future product ideas stemming from conflicting priorities and perspectives.\n\nThe Industrial Designer was focused on the practicalities and feasibility of incorporating certain features, such as kinetic energy charging. They raised concerns about the effectiveness of kinetic charging for a device that often remains stationary and the limited availability of certain materials.\n\nMarketing, on the other hand, prioritized market trends and consumer preferences, particularly the desire for a \"fancy look and feel\" and innovative technology. Marketing pushed for incorporating elements like fruit and vegetable-inspired designs and upgradable features, potentially conflicting with the Industrial Designer's concerns about design restrictions and component availability.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts primarily discuss HEFCW's powers of intervention, focusing on their perceived inflexibility and difficulty in use. HEFCW characterized these powers as \"threatening\" and cumbersome for swift interventions. The Minister acknowledged this feedback and expressed a desire for more flexible regulatory powers in the new PCET Bill, including advice, guidance, and enhanced monitoring.\n\nConcerns were raised that the current system lacks a graduated series of actions, jumping from informal measures to potentially severe sanctions. The discussion touched on the balance between institutional autonomy and the need for regulation to achieve national outcomes. The Minister emphasized the importance of a \"civic mission\" for tertiary education providers and the use of outcome agreements to align the sector with social, economic, and civic needs.\n\nRecent high-profile issues at Swansea and Trinity St David Universities were mentioned. HEFCW's decision not to use its powers of intervention was questioned. The Minister defended HEFCW, stating that they were supporting the universities through challenging times and that she trusted their professional judgement.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the group's marketing strategy involves creating a fancy, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, fashionable, easy-to-find, and robust product. They aim to achieve this by designing a remote control with a fruit shape and rubber material. They are targeting younger, tech-savvy consumers who are willing to spend more on a remote with features like speech recognition.\n\nFinancially, the group aims to keep production costs below 12.5 Euro per unit. With production costs in the budget, the group plans to sell the remote for 25 Euro, which will allow them to make a profit. \n",
    "The discussion centered on several key areas. Regarding policies and measures, there was talk of legislating to restrict price promotions and ban energy drinks, but there were concerns about the timeline for such legislation. The use of the planning system to restrict hot food takeaways near schools was also considered. Regarding physical education, it was suggested that there should be statutory guidance for schools. There was a discussion about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and accessible to children, especially girls. Finally, there was discussion of providing free school meals to all pupils to provide a more varied diet.\n",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design for the remote control to enhance comfort and ease of use. They wanted a design that felt good in the hand and was easy to hold.\n\nThey agreed on the \"easy to use\", \"fashion\", \"easy to find\", and \"robust\" features because market research indicated that customers prioritize a fancy outlook and innovative design over pure functionality. \"Easy to use\" was important, but secondary to the \"cool\" factor. \"Robust\" was deemed essential for product longevity and customer satisfaction.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by considering current trends, particularly the influence of \"fruit and veg\" in furniture and clothing design. They discussed incorporating organic shapes and spongy materials to align with these trends, aiming for a trendy and visually appealing product.\n"
