    " Dr David Blaney believes that the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector are the funding position, resulting from the recommendations of the Diamond review of fees and funding, and the decrease in EU students applying to study in Wales. He attributes the decline in EU student applications to two factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students, which will have a temporary effect, and the relative levels of investment in facilities between Wales and England. Dr Blaney notes that the Welsh higher education sector is exposed to sources of income from the EU, including EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. He mentions that the sector is beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and that there are signs of difficulties in playing in EU collaborative research activities. In terms of the financial impact, Dr Blaney notes that the UK's departure from the EU may result in some money being available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a matter of politics. He emphasizes that the sector is anticipating some turbulence and that the implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to the sector's sustainability. In response to a question about the reasons behind the drop in EU student applications, Dr Blaney attributes it to the change in student support arrangements and the relative levels of investment in facilities between Wales and England. He notes that some institutions, such as Cardiff University, have reported a significant drop in EU student applications, while others, like Swansea University, have seen an increase. In terms of the financial implications, Dr Blaney mentions that the sector is experiencing a managed deficit, which is not a crisis, but rather a challenging situation that institutions are managing. He notes that the sector is taking out cost to balance the books, but this has a detrimental effect on capacity, leading to a reduction in the range of the curriculum, research, and innovation. Despite the challenges, Dr Blaney is confident that the sector is managing the situation and that the institutions are alert to the challenges they are facing. In terms of the universities' reserves, Dr Blaney notes that the sector is generating operating cash, but at a lower rate than English institutions. He mentions that the sector is concerned about the operating cash situation and the need for institutions to generate sufficient cash to meet their costs, including the costs of servicing their borrowings. In terms of the financial sustainability of the higher education sector, Dr Blaney notes that the sector is facing significant financial challenges, including a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, uncertainty caused by the Augar review in England, and Brexit. He emphasizes that the sector is not seeing a crisis, but rather a challenging situation that institutions are managing. In terms of the universities' estates strategy and financing, Dr Blaney notes that the sector is content with the governance machinery within the institutions and that the governing bodies are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs. He mentions that the sector is keen to see",

    " KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"The principles we are applying to both schools and further education colleges are primarily around ensuring that we can keep our children safe, and that we can operate safely in an education setting. The principles are about ensuring that we can provide a safe and healthy environment for all students and staff. With regard to special educational needs, we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time, but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and wellbeing. We need to ensure that we have the right support in place for our children and families. The additional money we are making available to local authorities is to enable them to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. We are also looking at how we can support our teachers and other staff who are working with children and families.\"  (From transcript pages 24-25)  KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"We have been working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. We are also looking beyond the UK to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic. Recently, I was able to talk to educationalists and Ministers in Iceland, other parts of Europe, North America, South America and Australia. We will need to be very clear, as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals, about the basis of that evidence.\"  (From transcript page 14)  KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"My expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns. So, there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child's welfare and safety.\"  (From transcript pages 31-32)  KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"The overriding public health message from our Government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible, and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly, safely and effectively, we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs.\"  (From transcript page 17)  KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"When we are discussing these challenges, we are doing that with our colleagues in both the school sector but also our colleagues in the FE sector, and we're in close contact with colleagues in higher education to share thinking on these matters.\"  (From transcript page 12)  KIRSTY WILLIAMS AM:  \"Our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the",
