    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the group discussed the need for changes to the IBM transcription process. The group implemented beeps with spoken digits to help the transcribers keep track of their place in the file and to help align the transcriptions with what they were sent. They also discussed the potential for transcribers to insert bracketed digit strings into the transcript.\n\nRegarding the use of English, Professor F raised the concern about the quality of English used by participants, suggesting a focus on native or highly proficient speakers to ensure the corpus's usefulness for language modeling and computational linguistics research. There was a discussion about advertising to linguistics grad students to ensure proficiency in English. The group generally agreed that the meetings should be held in English, and it was acceptable if some participants had less-than-perfect English skills.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in influencing decisions within the system. They considered how a user's budget, represented as a changing number, could impact decisions. One participant expressed feeling unsure how to represent a continuously changing value like a running budget. The group differentiated between \"user finance\" (a general financial policy) and the \"user's budget\" (current spending money).\n\nThey explored the idea of discrete values for the budget (e.g., cheap, average, spendy) and how these values could influence outcomes. They also talked about how the budget would be updated externally to the belief net, based on user actions, and the need for a conversion mechanism to translate the numerical budget into relevant decision-making ranges. The group questioned when beliefs should be propagated after the budget is updated.",
    "The discussions centered around the uncertainty of the Canadian economy due to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of the government's economic measures.\n\nCathy McLeod highlighted the pre-existing economic troubles before COVID-19 and criticized the government for its lack of transparency in providing an economic update. She pointed out that the forestry industry, already in crisis, was not receiving adequate support.\n\nMona Fortier acknowledged the economic uncertainty but defended the government's actions, stating they were being open and transparent by reporting bi-weekly to Parliament on the status of their economic measures. She indicated that a comprehensive economic update would be provided as soon as clear economic projections were possible.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned whether the Liberal Party would have laid off staff if they had not taken advantage of emergency programs and pointed out that fishing companies in the Magdalen Islands needed the money more than the Liberals.\n",
    "The industrial manager, Xavier Juergens, considered the tiger's hunting style, security, and hiding spots worthy of study. He stated that the tiger \"hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well-thought way\" and \"always goes for security, in seeking a hide spot and doing everything.\" In essence, the tiger embodies a strategic, thoughtful approach coupled with a focus on safety and concealment. These characteristics could inspire design elements related to user experience, security features, or even the physical form of the product, perhaps emphasizing a sense of reliability and user protection.",
    "The team considered incorporating voice recognition software into their design, but there were concerns about cost. The industrial designer initially thought voice recognition would be cheap, but the marketing team questioned whether the costs would be feasible. The user interface team member suggested that customers didn't mention the battery, but shape and colors were important. There was also discussion about whether to use voice recognition in the standard model or offer it as an upgrade for a \"business class\" version. Ultimately, the team decided to remove voice recognition from the initial design to meet budget specifications, but they recommended increasing the budget for future iterations. They also considered a beeper function as an alternative to voice recognition.\n",
    "The presentations covered several key aspects of designing a new remote control. The components design presentation focused on the physical materials and components, proposing a curved or double-curved case made of plastic with additional design elements like wood, latex, or titanium. The choice of buttons (pushbuttons or scroll wheels) was discussed, with a simple chip preferred for cost reasons. A kinetic battery was suggested as a fashion-forward feature.\n\nThe user interface presentation emphasized simplicity and ease of use, drawing inspiration from the iPod's interface. The presenter suggested having a small set of buttons for essential functions (favorite channels, volume, power) and accessing more advanced features through an on-screen menu system.\n\nThe trend-watching presentation highlighted the shift towards fancy look and feel remotes, with fruits and vegetables and spongy materials being a top trend. However, there was some skepticism about fully embracing these trends due to concerns about practicality and longevity. Overall, the presentations aimed to balance fashion, functionality, and cost-effectiveness in the design of the new remote control.\n",
    "The early implementer areas have provided valuable lessons for the Welsh Government's childcare offer. One key takeaway is the administrative burden associated with the current approach, which requires parents to provide extensive documentation to prove eligibility. This process can be particularly challenging for families with complex circumstances.\n\nThe intensity of demand for services varies across different areas due to economic and cultural factors, such as family traditions of childcare within the family. Despite these challenges, the early implementation has not revealed significant issues with capacity, whether in English or Welsh language provision, or for children with complex needs.\n\nThe Minister expressed confidence that these lessons will inform a full roll-out by 2020, learning from experiences elsewhere and adapting the program to address local needs and challenges. The government is working to streamline the administrative processes and ensure that the childcare sector is robust and resilient.\n",
    "The Project Manager had evolving thoughts on the product's features. Initially, the Project Manager was open to LCD incorporation and speech recognition, but cost constraints were a concern. They suggested using the TV screen for feedback to avoid the cost of an LCD. The Project Manager was skeptical about speech recognition's reliability and favored limiting the remote to TV functions.\n\nLater, with a budget of 12.5 Euros, the Project Manager scrapped speech recognition due to cost. They prioritized the \"squishy feeling\" of a rubber material for the remote, citing marketing research. The manager favored keeping the remote's curve for differentiation and suggested customizable covers to maintain a trendy design. The Project Manager acknowledged the lack of financial information during the initial design phase.\n\nUltimately, the Project Manager was not keen on speech recognition technologies. They expressed that the L_C_D_ screen was more worth than speech recognition.\n",
    "The team discussed recording conventions, particularly concerning microphone usage and the potential for incorporating video recordings. There was a consensus on standardizing microphone types to improve audio quality for transcription and downstream tasks like dialogue analysis. Wireless microphones were favored for flexibility, and replacing wired ones was considered. The team acknowledged the importance of capturing the spatial arrangement of participants and board content.\n\nVideo recording was proposed to capture visual information, but concerns were raised about infrastructure needs, data storage, and participant privacy. Anonymizing faces in video was suggested as a possible solution. The team recognized the potential benefits of video for tasks like summarization and spatial mapping of speakers but ultimately decided to prioritize their immediate research needs and available resources. They agreed to explore video options further if external collaborators expressed interest and could provide the necessary infrastructure.",
    "The discussion on project finance revealed that the team was able to meet the target cost of twelve and a half Euro by using a regular standard chip, which was an acceptable compromise. They argued that the product's innovative design and fashion accessory concept, with interchangeable covers, justified exceeding the constraints.\n\nRegarding the use of the drawing board, the project manager mentioned following a Master class for the SMARTboard. The marketing team brought it to the first two meetings but didn't use it after the first. It was felt that the SMARTboard pen wasn't user-friendly, as it took time to draw and write, and wasn't very precise. Team members suggested that the software needed improvement to be quicker and easier to use, like a regular pen and paper. One team member felt the board was better than flip-overs but could be improved with better image insertion.",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer focused on the visual appeal and fashionableness of the remote control, drawing parallels to the iPod's success. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of an attractive design that would immediately entice potential buyers. The Project Manager concentrated on the practical aspects of the project, such as timelines, budget constraints, and market competition. The Project Manager repeatedly requested detailed plans and documentation from the team members, particularly from the Industrial Designer and the Marketing representative, to present a comprehensive proposal to the management.\n\nBased on the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the team had made significant progress. The Project Manager recognized that the team had successfully addressed key design elements, such as button functionality and visible light features. The Project Manager also acknowledged the importance of cost-effectiveness and the need to stay within the budget constraints, suggesting potential compromises to achieve this goal.",
    "The team's decision-making process regarding the base of the remote involved weighing the pros and cons of a charging base versus a smaller, more compact design. Ultimately, they opted against a charging base, deeming it clunky and less appealing than a smaller, more advanced design, aligning with current trends in cellphones.\n\nFashionability was evaluated in the context of incorporating current trends like fruits, vegetables, and spongy materials. While acknowledging the importance of a \"fancy look and feel,\" the team expressed concerns about the longevity of such trends. They considered fruit-themed covers and the use of latex for a soft, grippable texture.\n\nThe discussion on existing remotes highlighted the desire for simplicity and ease of use. They analyzed the button layouts and functionality of various devices, including iPods and children's remotes. The team aimed to minimize the number of buttons while providing essential functions and potentially incorporating an on-screen menu for advanced settings.\n",
    "The group discussed the possibility of using environmental-friendly material, with the trend leaning towards soft, spongy, and ergonomic materials, potentially capitalizing on the current market's lack of such designs. They considered potential materials like plastic, rubber, wood, and titanium, but noted restrictions on combining them and titanium's limitation to square shapes. The idea of a spongy material was favored for a comfortable grip and a unique feel.\n\nThe group explored vibrant, natural colors, particularly the corporate color yellow, and considered themes like lemon or lime to unify the design. They also discussed the \"look and feel\" priority, aiming for innovative designs that contribute to the aesthetic appeal rather than just functionality.\n\nThe discussion touched on the size and shape of the remote, with preferences for a comfortable, slim design that sits well in the hand. A questionnaire was not mentioned in the group's discussion.\n",
    "The Project Manager introduced the functional design meeting, emphasizing user needs, technical effects, and working design, with meeting minutes available in a shared folder.\n\nThe User Interface designer focused on user-friendly and fashionable design, emphasizing button placement, minimizing button numbers, appropriate sizing, and findability. They showed two \"boring\" remotes and wanted something more fun in color, size, and shape. The Industrial Designer discussed the mechanical functions, including basic remote functions and a location function with a button on the TV to signal the remote to beep or vibrate. New project requirements included removing teletext, limiting the remote to TV functions only, and incorporating the corporate image (fashion in electronics, silver, gold, or yellow colors).\n\nThe group debated multi-functional versus single-functional products, considering a joystick-like interface versus traditional buttons. The technological aspect received lower grades due to the prototypes not having L_C_D_ screens or fancy chips. The \"potato\" prototype was selected for further development.\n\nThe locator function was considered in presenting the functional requirements, but technological difficulties and questions about its necessity led to its potential exclusion.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C agreed to focus on energy distributions to detect speech overlaps. PhD A suggested starting with raw energy and log energy, and PhD C agreed to begin with the basic energy distribution before moving to more complex analyses like scatter plots.\n\nThe discussion with Jose involved his method of analyzing speech energy. He was using log energy and normalizing the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation over 200-millisecond windows. PhD A suggested varying the window size and using moving windows.\n\nThe problem of overlaps was highlighted, with a concern that the current interface doesn't fully capture overlap details. The musical score notation was suggested as an ideal representation. They also discussed the need for automatic channel identification to help transcribers disentangle overlaps more easily.\n",
    "The meetings discussed the latency of the system. The main concern was that the system's latency was too high, especially compared to other proposals. The initial total latency was 330 milliseconds. The professor noted that the allowable latency was 250 milliseconds, unless the rules changed. The best proposal had a latency of only 30 or 40 milliseconds.\n\nThe professor had an issue with the latency because he felt it was too high and put them at a disadvantage compared to other systems. He believed they were trading latency for performance, while others were trading computation for performance. The team discussed different components contributing to the latency, including LDA filters (10 ms), online normalization (85 ms), neural net and PCA (80 ms), and downsampling (10ms). The team was trying to reduce the latency by optimizing various processes, such as implementing IIR filters instead of FIR filters. They were also considering the impact of spectral subtraction and VAD (voice activity detection) on latency. The team needs to decide whether to prioritize performance or latency.\n",
    "The detailed design of the User Interface prototype introduces several key features and advantages. It has an ergonomic shape, is made of wood, and has customizable colors. The design incorporates an L_C_D_ screen on a flip panel. There is a large, easily accessible on/off button and a numeric pad. It also has voice recognition control. The microphone can be placed on the side to be accessible, even when the flip is closed.\n\nThese features aim to provide a stylish and user-friendly experience while remaining within budget. The design also allows for customized backing and aims for a weight that feels substantial without being excessively heavy. The option of using the internet for promotion and sales was also brought up. This would allow potential customers to view the different options and see what other people have done.\n",
    "The prototype presentation focused on a new remote control design. The appearance featured a gunmetal gray plastic base that lights up when any button is pressed. The on/off switch is located on the back. The design incorporated a curvature for comfortable handling. The two squared buttons are intended for the least used functions: menu and mute. Thumb-shaped buttons are used for channel and volume control. Black labeling is planned for the top.\n\nTwo prototype versions were presented: one shaped like a yellow blob and another shaped like a yellow banana with black buttons, reflecting the company colors. Both versions featured a similar push-button technology, an on/off switch, and infrared functionality. One version was envisioned with hard, smooth plastic, while the other considered a spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. The team discussed the potential for a combination of the two materials. The cost was a major factor in the decision.\n",
    "The group explored various aspects of the new product's design, considering budget constraints and functionality. Regarding the touch screen, the high cost (estimated at \u20ac17.50 per remote) led to its rejection as a primary feature, although a simpler version wasn't entirely dismissed. Flip screens were considered, with LCDs being a potential option for the top side, but rubberized buttons were ultimately favored for the bottom side due to their durability and compatibility with the desired spongy feel.\n\nBattery issues were a major point of discussion, with options including standard batteries, solar charging (with a backup battery for reliability), and kinetic charging. Solar charging aligned with the company's environmentally friendly theme. The flip-top design was intended to be unique and trendy, moving away from the typical remote control look. The group considered a non-remote-like design, possibly inspired by Apple products, with a focus on a rubberized, tactile feel and multiple color options for the case. Ultimately, the aim was to balance innovation, functionality, and cost-effectiveness while creating a product that would appeal to a younger target market.",
    "The Government is drawing lessons from the Schools Challenge Cymru program and is working to implement changes that will positively impact schools. Estyn noted that the program was variable, and the improvements overall for the 40 schools were slightly better than all schools in Wales. The Government is also taking steps to identify schools that need support earlier and is working with local authorities to use their powers of intervention more proactively. The categorization system is evolving, and the multi-agency approach is a better way to assist schools in moving forward.\n",
    "Dr. David Blaney acknowledges a decrease in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, contrasting with an increase in England. He suggests two primary reasons for this decline. Firstly, the change in student support arrangements for EU students, where they now face the full fee, is a perturbation that he hopes is temporary. Secondly, the competitive recruitment market requires institutions to invest in facilities, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over time have likely impacted the attractiveness of Welsh institutions.\n\nRegarding why prospective students should choose to study in Wales, Dr. Blaney notes that the \"Study in Wales\" program aims to distinguish the Welsh experience. A key message is relative safety, as Wales is perceived as a comfortable and safe environment, partly due to the smaller size of its cities. The messaging emphasizes a UK-quality system and degree available in a safer and more supportive environment.\n",
    "The mental spaces are structured with a layered approach. At the bottom layer are the observed features extracted from communication, such as prosody, discourse elements (like discussing admission fees), verb choices, and contextual information (tourist vs. business person, time of day). The middle layer consists of hidden variables that represent concepts like whether someone is on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry. These hidden variables are probabilistically influenced by the features in the bottom layer. The top layer represents the different modes of interaction such as entering, vista-ing, or tango-ing.\n\nThe middle layer functions as an intermediary between the observed features and the output modes. It allows the system to infer higher-level concepts from the raw data, which then inform the decision-making process for selecting the appropriate mode. This design aims to prevent a combinatorial explosion of probabilities by summarizing the input features into a more manageable set of concepts. For example, if someone is inferred to be in a hurry, they would be less likely to want to vista.",
    "The professor believes that the back-end should have properties filled in from ontology items. He uses the endpoint as an example, stating that if there are a few key properties like whether it is a tourist site, some kind of landmark, a place of business, or something you could physically enter, then those properties would fit into the decision node. As part of the outer controlling conditioning, those would be set. Someone would find the word, look it up in the ontology, pull out those properties, put it into the belief net, and then the decision would flow.\n\nThe professor also mentions that the database is well-formed because there is an ontology and database. There aren't really deep mysteries about what things the system knows about. The database is in German, but they commissioned someone to translate some bits of it.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts contain discussions on several key issues. Regarding the seniors care crisis, there is acknowledgment of the disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reports of neglect and abuse. There is a call for national standards of care and a discussion on the role of profit in long-term care.\n\nSeveral speakers address racism and systemic discrimination, particularly anti-Black racism and the treatment of Indigenous peoples. There are calls to end racial profiling, over-policing, and over-incarceration.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were mentioned in the context of emergency programs and the need to support workers and small businesses affected by COVID-19. \n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay encouraged public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families.\n\nNo statement from the Minister of Seniors regarding pandemic assistance for seniors was included.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer experienced disagreements regarding the remote control design due to their differing priorities and expertise. Marketing focused on what would appeal to consumers and drive sales, emphasizing aesthetics, ease of use, and features like parental control. The Industrial Designer concentrated on the technical feasibility, cost, and practicality of implementing various features, shapes, and materials. The Project Manager aimed to balance these competing interests while adhering to budget constraints, management directives (like limiting the remote to TV functionality only), and maintaining the company's brand image. These different perspectives naturally led to clashes as they debated design elements like parental controls, shape, color, buttons, wireless control, technical design, and overall style.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation by first reviewing all points of discussion from the beginning of the meetings, using these as criteria for evaluation. These criteria were based on user requirements and trends found in marketing reports and the company's marketing strategy. The specific criteria brought forward were: a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, incorporation of current fashion trends (specifically spongy texture and fruit/vegetable design colors), minimization of RSI, and ease of location (potentially with voice recognition or a beeper function). The team then collectively rated the design against these criteria using a scale, aiming to reach a consensus on each point.\n",
    "Currently, the transcription process utilizes a tool called \"Transcriber,\" which allows for the identification of speech segments and the transcription of the content, speaker identification, and start/end times. The group is discussing whether to use commercial transcription services or linguistics students. Jane is piloting the tool.\n\nThe group is also considering the format for distributing the collected corpus, including transcripts and audio files. There is a discussion about whether to use the same format as the LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium).\n\nRegarding intermediate categories, the group acknowledges the need to formalize the data preparation process. There is a mention of using X Waves and Perl scripts to extract and align digits. The group is also discussing the use of a French group's tool, \"Transcriber,\" for transcription purposes. A standardized format has not been adopted as of yet.\n",
    "The Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness by emphasizing that they were a response to the committee's recommendation from the Stage 1 report. She committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign for approximately six years. She didn't find the other amendments helpful or necessary, as they placed unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister stated that her amendments were influenced by the committee's recommendations. She assured that the post-implementation review would be a continuous program of work. She considered an amendment unnecessary, as she was preparing to assess the effectiveness of awareness-raising.\n\nThe Deputy Minister did not directly address regulation-making powers in the provided transcripts.",
    "The discussion on long-term trends in raising standards and improving educational attainment highlighted the need for curriculum reform, with broad support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum and greater autonomy for teachers. Philip Blaker of Qualifications Wales emphasized their role in maintaining standards, ensuring fair grading, and improving timelines for reforms. He also noted the current reliance on commercial publishers for textbooks, suggesting a need to explore different models.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of exams, the witnesses discussed the need for adequate preparation time, with Gareth Pierce suggesting 18 months to two years from specification approval to resource availability. Kirsty Williams noted the curriculum implementation was delayed one year to allow more preparation. Overall, the emphasis was on a collaborative approach, involving teachers, consortia, and government bodies, to ensure effective implementation and address concerns about workload and resource availability.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted several challenges in implementing good practice across Wales, particularly concerning childcare services.\n\nOne key issue is the **variance in early childhood education and care provision across different regions**. This is due to the historical decisions of local authorities regarding the Foundation Phase and the geographically targeted nature of programs like Flying Start. The Welsh Government aims to address this inconsistency and ensure facilities meet local needs.\n\nAnother challenge is the **complexity of the existing system**. The Deputy Minister acknowledged the need for simplification and mentioned pathfinder projects in eight local authorities exploring ways to join up the system. The goal is to improve accessibility, take-up, and effectiveness of services for children and families.\n\nAdditionally, the discussion touched on the **importance of the Welsh language** and the need to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare workforce. Efforts are underway to support bilingual settings and attract staff with the necessary skills.",
    "The discussion centered on the availability and selection of components for a new remote control design. For the case material, initial options included plastic, rubber, titanium, and wood. Concerns about heat resistance, brittleness, and manufacturing limitations led to the elimination of rubber, plastic, and titanium. Wood emerged as the preferred choice due to its environmentally friendly nature and potential for customization.\n\nRegarding the user interface, the team explored pushbuttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. While a scroll wheel was considered for menu navigation, pushbuttons were favored for channel selection. The decision on whether to include an LCD screen was deferred pending further cost analysis.\n\nThe team also discussed the chip-on-print, considering simple, regular, and advanced options. The advanced chip-on-print, with integrated infrared sender, sensor, and speaker, was favored, but the final decision depended on the chosen user interface and budget constraints. The energy source was determined to be a basic battery.\n",
    "Professor A expresses interest in the final model, specifically regarding the amount of training data used. He suggests that the improved performance observed with large datasets, like those used by commercial entities, could be attributed to the numerous occurrences of similar allophones.\n\nThe discussion touches on time series modeling, with Grad B exploring the use of factorial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to model the time series of feature detectors. He also mentions modulation spectrum analysis as a method to address reverberation, referencing Avendano's work on dealing with reverberation effects by adjusting time and frequency resolutions.\n\nRegarding pronunciation, the group discusses the pronunciation of the digit \"0\" (zero), recognizing that it can be pronounced as either \"zero\" or \"O\". They acknowledge the need to account for both pronunciations in digit recognition tasks, as well as that the team is trying to get people to read the digits as they ordinarily would.\n",
    "The group discussed and made decisions on the introduction of the new remote control project, focusing on several key aspects. The initial concept of a universal versus specific remote control was considered, but due to time limitations, the decision was made to restrict the remote to television (TV) only.\n\nThe group decided to use voice recognition with a limited vocabulary. They will have a simple layout with minimal buttons, rubber buttons, and a non-remote-like design, with side menu options. They will target a younger demographic, 18-35 year olds.\n\nOther ideas mentioned were a scroll wheel, parental control, and games, but these were not pursued. The idea of different colors was decided upon, but faceplates or skins were not.\n",
    "The group discussed the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, particularly the potential increase in suicide among children and young people. Vaughan Gething mentioned that the government had commissioned a review, through the delivery unit working with the national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths during the pandemic's start and understand if restrictions led to a spike in suicides. A report was expected by the end of the month, and the committee would be informed of its findings.\n\nGething addressed the provision of long-term special care for pregnant women, emphasizing the commitment to maintaining perinatal support despite the pandemic. The shift to phone and online services was explored to minimize physical contact. He acknowledged a pause in work to create in-patient capacity and expressed concern about the timeframe, while praising the staff's dedication to delivering services during this challenging time. He also noted a decrease in women seeking mother and baby unit provision due to fear and lockdown, but assured that this would not affect future planning for the facility.\n",
    "The Together for Children and Young People programme is scheduled to end in October of this year. The legacy arrangements will most likely move to the CAMHS network, which is part of the NHS mental health network. The whole-school approach is already settled in Government. Where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go is still an outstanding question. There were no specific opinions on the risk of losing focus mentioned in the meeting.\n\nRegarding improvements that present more of a challenge, there was a discussion about enhancing the scope of services.\n\nThe meeting discussed the importance of networking within the PRU sector and collaborative work between schools and PRUs. Transition arrangements were also discussed, with concerns raised about young people falling through the gaps when transitioning from children's to adult services. An evaluation of the transition guidance is underway.\n",
    "The group's thoughts on infra-red functionality were primarily technical. The industrial designer, Mael, stated that most remote controls use infra-red to send signals to the TV, presumably due to cost. He also stated that all TVs use that at the moment.\n\nRegarding disposable income, the marketing representative, Anna, presented survey data indicating that 90% of 15-25 year olds would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control, compared to a much lower percentage of older age groups. This led to a discussion about the disposable income of the 15-25 year old demographic, with Anna arguing that this age group often has fewer financial commitments (like mortgages or car payments) and therefore may have more disposable income to spend on a stylish remote control.\n",
    "The group's opinion on free school meal eligibility as a measure is that it is the best available proxy for need, though not perfect. There is recognition that a better, more focused measure is desirable, especially considering the rollout of Universal Credit and its potential impact on eligibility.\n\nRegarding the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, the group acknowledges improvements in attendance, but notes a persistent gap between children receiving free school meals and their peers. Some schools are proactively using PDG to address attendance issues, such as sending teaching assistants out to create walking buses. However, it's recognized that interventions become more challenging as children get older. The group suggests that community-focused schooling and engaging with parents are crucial for improving attendance and engagement.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, Professor G. had a mixed opinion on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). While he acknowledged the potential of SVMs, he also pointed out that traditional methods with Gaussians and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) had previously worked well. He suggested broadening existing methods by including non-silence boundaries as potential change points, instead of focusing solely on feature engineering.\n\nIn regards to speech rate algorithms, the professor did not specifically comment on speech rate algorithms, but he did mention the use of commercial devices that perform voice activity detection (VAD) using cross-correlation. He suggested exploring such methods to improve the selection of who is speaking in overlapping speech segments, rather than relying on absolute amplitude thresholds. Additionally, there was discussion of using neural networks for VAD, which could be trained on cleaned-up speech to improve performance.",
    "Professor E shares opinions from two speakers, PHD D and John Allen. PHD D is studying speech recordings to find a good solution to detect overlapping zones. He has transcribed the first session and found 1,000 acoustic events, including breaths, aspirations, talk, and claps, besides overlapping zones. The professor said there is continual noise from fans and impulsive noise from taps, which are worthwhile to study.\n\nJohn Allen observed in the twenties that narrow band information should be used for phonetic features rather than the typical sound units. He also observed that the targets come from multi-band training where the phonetic label for the sound is trained. The professor said the problem with this is that they don't know if it is a particularly good feature and it may be difficult for humans to reliably mark.",
    "The team discussed the user interface design of the remote control, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. Based on market research indicating that most users only utilize a small percentage of buttons, they decided to minimize the number of buttons. The team agreed to focus solely on TV functionality to expedite development.\n\nThe design will incorporate a scroll wheel for channel selection, which is a familiar feature to older users from radios, and digits on the lower side. Backlighting will be added for visibility in the dark. A curved design was favored and the inclusion of an LCD screen and voice recognition were rejected, as they would delay the project and exceed budget constraints. The team also considered integrating teletext and subtitles into one button. The final design will prioritize clear labeling and accessibility of essential functions like channel and volume control.",
    "The project manager favored a rubber material for the device's cover due to its \"squishy\" feel and durability, aligning with marketing research findings. They were open to using plastic for the basic cover to potentially reduce costs. While the initial design included a special color, the project manager was willing to forgo it to meet budget constraints, suggesting the device be delivered in basic black. However, they acknowledged this could diminish the product's style. Regarding the shape, the project manager initially supported a \"banana curve\" to differentiate it from other remote controls but later prioritized retaining the rubber material over the curve. They liked the idea of changeable covers to keep the product trendy.",
    "The discussion focused on fixing the current system and improving the baseline. The team combined software to create a single piece of software with options, aiming for a default system performance of fifty-three point sixty-six, which is just one percent off the best proposal.\n\nThe major points of discussion revolved around noise suppression techniques using spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering, the voice activity detector (VAD), and noise estimation. The team discussed training the neural net on cleaned-up speech and the importance of a good VAD. They are considering training the VAD neural network with more data and better features, potentially PLP and RASTA features. They also addressed concerns about latency and explored methods for frame dropping and noise estimation. The team aims to improve the VAD, potentially using a neural network trained on more data and better features. They also consider improving noise estimation, and are working towards a firm path for system improvements.",
    "The meetings covered a range of topics, including legislation like Bill C-7 and Bill S-204, and firearm regulations. Discussions also addressed sports infrastructural construction and potential government support for energy resources and tourism.\n\nFunding for the green economy and small businesses was a key concern, with members pressing for details on the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund and the Canada Emergency Business Account. The impact of COVID-19 on specific sectors was examined, including fishing (particularly lobster), tourism, and the oil and gas industry, with calls for tailored support measures.\n",
    "The team considered the number of functions on the remote, aiming for simplicity and prioritizing the most-used features. The team decided to change the shape of the remote to be less boring and more exciting. The team liked the idea of the single-curved design to give it a more aesthetic feel. The team discussed the idea of personalization through changeable covers to suit different tastes and match home decor, and the team agreed on multiple case colors. The team seemed to agree that the novel shape of the remote should be non-remote-like. The team decided to go with the rubber button design and a simple design to keep it from being too complicated.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed different colors, specifically lemon or lime, for the product due to an emerging theme of fruits and vegetables in top European fashion trends, especially in clothes and furniture. The market research indicated that consumers desired a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one, and vibrant natural colors were considered essential. The consultants in Paris and Milan also noted a trend toward a spongy feel to materials, contrasting with the previous year's trends. The idea was to align the remote control design with these fashion trends, making it more appealing and trendy to consumers.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the overall conclusion is that the new remote control should prioritize user-friendliness, aesthetics, and minimization of repetitive strain injury (RSI) while adhering to new project requirements. Market research indicates a willingness among users, especially younger demographics, to pay more for a stylish and functional remote. To address RSI concerns, a comfortable design with fewer, well-placed buttons, and potentially speech recognition, is being considered.\n\nThe team is exploring various design options, including a scroll wheel interface and a limited number of buttons, possibly with a hidden compartment for less frequently used functions. The remote will focus solely on television functionality, excluding teletext, and incorporate the company's logo and colors. While initial ideas included LCD screens and advanced features, cost constraints are a concern, and the team is investigating innovative solutions to balance functionality with affordability.\n",
    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) representatives Dr. David Blaney and Bethan Owen, addressed the Children, Young People and Education Committee regarding the impact of Brexit on higher education.\n\nDr. Blaney began by stating that universities contribute significantly to Wales, with an annual impact of approximately \u00a35 billion and 50,000 jobs, adding that uncertainty surrounding relationships with Europe is a major concern for university management. Bethan Owen noted an 8% decrease in European Union-domiciled applicants to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 2% increase in English institutions. Applications from non-EU students also decreased by 9% in Wales, while England saw a 7% increase.\n\nDr. Blaney and Owen said that factors contributing to this decline included changes in student support arrangements for EU students, as well as investment in facilities, particularly buildings and equipment, in England. They also said that they expect universities to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process.",
    "The meeting transcript discusses the Meeting Recorder digits and their performance. The English near microphone achieved 3-4% accuracy using the tandem system, which is significantly worse than the SRI system that uses a huge amount of data and online unsupervised adaptation. It was discussed that the SRI system's error rate is around 50% worse without adaptation.\n\nThe group explored potential reasons for the performance difference, including the amount of training data, recording conditions, and background noise. Commercial systems with vast data sets achieve better results due to more occurrences of similar allophones. It was also noted that the TI-digits database is very clean and studio-recorded, unlike the more realistic Meeting Recorder data.\n\nThe team considered retraining the tandem system with more data or improving the back-end but recognized that the amount of training data is a significant factor. Overall, the discussion emphasized the need for more data to improve the accuracy of digit recognition in the Meeting Recorder environment.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, a speech recognition interface is recommended for the remote control for several reasons.\n\n*   **Market Research**: Marketing's survey indicated that consumers are frustrated with losing remotes and find them too complicated. Speech recognition, combined with a glow-in-the-dark feature, could help users locate the remote and simplify operation.\n*   **Consumer Willingness to Pay**: Marketing also found that consumers are willing to pay more for fancy features, suggesting speech recognition could be a selling point.\n*   **Trendy and Cutting Edge**: The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer suggest that speech recognition provides a \"cutting edge\" feel. It differentiates the remote from competitors using standard buttons.\n*   **Simplification**: The User Interface Designer notes that voice recognition could simplify the interface by reducing the number of buttons needed. Users could speak commands instead of navigating complex menus.\n\nThe benefits of speech recognition according to the team include:\n\n*   **User Interface**: Simplification of the user interface.\n*   **Marketing**: Increased market sales.\n*   **Industrial Designer**: A way to differentiate the product and provide a cutting-edge feel.",
    "The discussion on consortia revealed mixed opinions. Jassa Scott noted their improved knowledge of schools' strengths and weaknesses and their use of this knowledge to support schools causing concern. However, she pointed out weaker support for developing digital competence and less impact on secondary schools due to recruitment challenges and a lack of strong practice. Estyn does not have specific inspection powers for regional consortia. The work of regional consortia will be specifically looked at over the next year to support curriculum reform work. Meilyr Rowlands stated that the greatest problem is ensuring multi-agency support for the schools, not the identification of the schools themselves. \n\nBill Blair's response to the firearms seizure issue at Pearson airport and proposed measures for ensuring social stability are not contained in this document.\n\nThe political background and aim of the group are not explicitly stated but can be inferred. The group consists of members of the Children, Young People, and Education Committee and aims to scrutinize and improve various aspects of the Welsh education system, including the Pupil Development Grant, curriculum development, and the work of regional consortia.\n",
    "The team discussed several key functions for the remote control. The marketing team's research indicated that users frequently lose their remotes, leading to the suggestion of a \"lost-and-found\" function. This idea evolved into a discussion about incorporating a homing device, potentially through a beeping function or a light.\n\nProject evaluation revealed that users primarily use a small percentage of the buttons on existing remotes (channel, volume, and power). This led to a consensus on simplifying the design by reducing the number of buttons and making them larger for ease of use.\n\nBrainstorming for new functions included speech recognition, which was seen as a modern and potentially desirable feature. The team also considered integrating a charging base to address battery life concerns and provide a convenient location for the remote, potentially combined with the lost-and-found function. The industrial designer suggested including LEDs for visual feedback and aesthetic appeal.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the project team considered the cost implications of different button colors. The original plan included a red apple button as a special color. However, to reduce costs and stay within the budget of 12.5 Euros, the project manager decided to eliminate the special colors.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied with this change because the team had previously agreed that color was more important than the curve of the remote. Marketing felt the remote would be negatively affected if it was entirely black. The team discussed offering custom covers as a way to allow customers to personalize the remote with different colors, but this idea did not satisfy Marketing's concern about the base product's lack of color.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted several key points regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension, employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales.\n\n**Welsh Dimension Implementation:**\nThe Welsh government plans to include specific aspects of the curriculum framework in primary legislation to ensure breadth and clarity. This includes statutory frameworks for progression in each Area of Learning and Experience (AoLE). While the \"what matters\" statements won't be in the primary legislation, the legal requirement to deliver them will be, ensuring a national approach while allowing for flexibility.\n\n**Employers' Understanding of the Welsh Bac:**\nThere's a consensus that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac, its content, and its value. There's a need for more engagement from employers in the review and design of the qualification to ensure it aligns with the skills they require. Some suggest that the focus has shifted from skills development to outcomes, and that the Welsh bac has become overly rigorous and bureaucratic. Employers need to be better informed about the skills challenge certificate and how the Welsh bac prepares students for the workforce.\n\n**Benefits of an Independent Body for Inspecting in Wales:**\nThe Minister expressed confidence that the university sector views the Welsh baccalaureate qualification as valuable for Welsh students and doesn't regard it as a detriment.",
    "The group expressed varying opinions on the presentation materials. Some felt the presentations were rushed due to time constraints. They also thought the whiteboard wasn't utilized to its full potential for brainstorming and visual note-taking.\n\nRegarding the convenience of use, the team generally agreed on prioritizing simplicity and user-friendliness in the remote's design. They liked the idea of larger, well-placed buttons for frequently used functions like volume and channel control. Speech recognition was considered a potentially convenient feature, especially for younger users, but concerns were raised about its energy consumption. There was a consensus to avoid a steep learning curve, aiming for a device that doesn't require extensive instructions. The team also liked the idea of a scroll wheel for navigation.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to cost concerns. The project manager stated that with the target price, it was not possible to include both an LCD and automatic speech recognition technologies. Additionally, it was argued that because they were targeting only TVs, the TV screen itself could provide feedback, reducing the need for an LCD on the remote. The user interface designer also pointed out that there was no information coming out of the TV to be displayed on the remote without a cable box or other device. It was agreed that the focus should be on the design and features that would make the product unique, such as a charging cradle, scroll wheel, and locator, while staying within a reasonable price range.\n",
    "The group consisted of a project manager, marketing expert, user interface designer, and industrial designer. They introduced themselves with their roles and favorite animals. The project was to design a remote control that was original, trendy, and user-friendly with a maximum production cost of 12.50 Euro.\n\nThe brainstorming process involved discussing specific features to include in the remote control, aiming for a sleek and stylish design. They explored ideas like a menu-based system and high battery life.\n\nThe project evaluation involved rating the prototype on a seven-point scale based on criteria such as ease of use, fashionability, how it feels, and technological innovation. They also discussed the cost of components to ensure they stayed within budget.\n\nThe project process was evaluated based on room for creativity, individual leadership, teamwork, and the technology used. The team felt somewhat stifled creatively due to the restriction to a T.V. remote and suggested that the survey and digital pens were irritating.\n",
    "During the discussion on extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special, the team explored several charging options for the device. The industrial designer stated that there was no rechargeable option available. They considered and quickly dismissed standard double-A and triple-A batteries due to their bulkiness. Dynamo charging was deemed impractical and \"silly.\" Solar charging was considered, with the idea that artificial light might charge the device, but this was questioned.\n\nKinetic charging, similar to that used in wristwatches, was also discussed. The team debated whether the limited movement of a remote control would generate enough charge, but the industrial designer felt it would. The user interface designer inquired about the lifespan of kinetic batteries. The marketing team asked about compatibility between solar charging and standard batteries and how the solar panels might affect the design and durability of the remote.\n",
    "The group decided to acquire a half dozen of the same microphone to standardize the audio input. Some members voiced concern about the microphone jacks not working and the headphones being uncomfortable. There was also a discussion about the placement of the microphones, and it was suggested that the microphones be placed towards the corner of the speaker's mouth, about a thumb or a thumb and a half away from the mouth, so that breath sounds are not captured. The aim is to improve the audio quality for transcription and dialogue research.\n",
    "Meilyr Rowlands of Estyn stated that secondary schools face a greater challenge than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum. He noted the financial constraints faced by secondary schools, with many operating in deficit, which impacts their ability to create space for teachers to engage with curriculum changes. Rowlands emphasized the importance of teachers being re-professionalized and having a more creative role in deciding how and what to teach.\n\nKirsty Williams AM discussed the challenges faced by secondary schools, emphasizing the need for support and multi-agency collaboration. She highlighted that schools should remain in contact with children, continue to identify vulnerable children, and refer children to children's services if they have any concerns. Williams also addressed the potential impact of the pandemic on children's mental health and well-being, stating that additional money would be made available to local authorities to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. She also noted that schools should be using the Hwb platform to communicate with parents, and to provide access to guidelines. \n",
    "The Industrial Designer (ID) contributed significantly to the design and material choices for the new spherical remote control. During the detailed design discussion, the ID suggested using rubber as the primary material due to its durability and color retention when scratched, offering a wide range of color possibilities to make the remote control visually appealing. The ID also suggested a design where the remote stands at an angle on a table, making it look nice.\n\nThe ID highlighted the advantages of an LCD touchscreen for easy cleaning. The ID also suggested that the batteries should be chargeable via a mount station and long-lasting. Regarding the internal components, the ID advocated for an advanced chip to facilitate speech recognition, although this was still in the testing phase. The ID initially thought business colors should be used, but later agreed that more fancy colors would be more interesting.\n",
    "The group expressed significant concerns regarding the impact of Brexit on Erasmus and mobility funding for students. They highlighted the importance of the Erasmus+ program and the need to find ways to support student mobility, whether through continued participation in Erasmus or alternative funding mechanisms. They also mentioned the importance of Welsh institutions remaining attractive to EU students.\n\nRegarding tuition fee refunds, the group did not directly address the question of whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees. However, they discussed the change in government policy regarding student support, which had previously allowed European students to benefit from a tuition fee grant. They acknowledged that this change may have an impact on EU recruitment.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several key issues. Regarding local authoritative frameworks, there was a petition presented to halt construction of the Coastal GasLink project on Wet'suwet'en territory, prioritize nation-to-nation talks, and implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On the subject of condolences, members mourned the passing of RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, Captain Jenn Casey, and entrepreneur Richard Losier.\n\nEmployment was discussed in the context of job creation, support for the energy sector, and the Canada Summer Jobs program. There were also concerns raised about the oil and gas sector, small businesses, and the tourism industry struggling due to the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of workers' safety, the appalling conditions in long-term care homes were a major point of discussion, including the need for national standards and addressing the issues raised in a military report. Finally, pay dispute situations arose in the context of workers who must reimburse CERB and a proposed cap on executive compensation.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, there is no mention of expressing thanks to the House of Commons or the Canadian Armed Forces from Whitehorse. However, there is thanks expressed to the Canadian Armed Forces for their deployment to the Altamont care home in Ontario and four other facilities across the GTA and for witnessing and reporting the appalling conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec.\n",
    "The group discussed the functions, characters, and design requirements of a remote control. They agreed the remote should be user-friendly for all age ranges, with a simplified design focusing on essential functions like power, volume, mute, and channel control. They wanted to keep the number of buttons down.\n\nThe prioritized functional requirement was ease of use, addressing user frustration with complex remotes. This included the idea of a \"homing device\" to help users locate the remote when lost, potentially through a charging base that could trigger a beep.\n\nThe scroll feature was mentioned in the context of channel selection. One suggestion was a wheel for incremental channel changes, combined with smaller, potentially concealed, digit buttons for direct channel input. They also discussed incorporating a \"previous channel\" button for quick switching between two channels.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion in the meetings are the design, functionality, and marketing of a new T_V_ remote control. The team explores various energy sources (batteries, kinetic, solar), case materials (plastic, rubber, wood, titanium), button types (push-buttons, scroll-wheels, L_C_D_), and potential features like voice recognition and a \"find my remote\" beeper.\n\nFor the upcoming team meeting, Catherine will work on the look and feel design, while Gabriel focuses on the user interface design. The goal is to present physical ideas and prototypes. The group reflects on previous meetings, noting the need for more information to make firm decisions. They also discuss the effectiveness of their communication methods (email, whiteboard, digital pens) and aim to finalize a product specification and prototype design that aligns with market research findings. Marketing also provides thoughts on repetitive strain injury, and the team wants to create a product that is anit-RSI.",
    "The lab tests revealed that users wanted a remote control that felt good and had important functions easily accessible. The group discussed the \"finder\" button, which would emit a beep to help locate the remote. They also talked about a \"call\" button, but its functionality wasn't clearly defined.\n\nRegarding button design, the team considered durability, fade-proof symbols, and the number of buttons. They wanted to stick to existing symbols but investigate possible replacements. The location function was explored, with the idea of a button on the T_V_ or a separate sticker that could trigger a signal in the remote.\n\nRegarding the lighting adaptive options, the team agreed to explore the possibility of incorporating changeable covers to appeal to a wider audience. They also considered the use of an L_C_D_ screen, but ultimately decided against it due to cost and size concerns. Instead, they opted for a simpler text-only display.\n",
    "The team discussed DAT (presumably referring to data collection) and the use of power cables, likely in the context of setting up recording equipment.\n\nRegarding capturing subject intention, the team is exploring how to infer a user's goal (e.g., \"view,\" \"enter,\" or \"approach\" a landmark) from their utterances and context. They acknowledged the limitations of current parsing technology (SmartKom) in capturing these nuances.\n\nSeveral approaches for analysis were considered:\n*   **Belief Nets:** Using belief nets to combine contextual, linguistic, and discourse information to infer intention.\n*   **Feature Extraction:** Identifying key features from parsed input (e.g., verb choice, modifiers) and contextual factors (e.g., time of day, user profile) to feed into the belief net.\n*   **M-3L augmentation:** Enriching existing M-3L structures with additional information derived from the intention analysis.\n*   **Wizard of Oz Experiment:** A \"wizard of oz\" experiment was used to simulate a computer call system and gather data on how people phrase requests depending on their intention.\n*   **Ontology Integration:** Leveraging ontology information (e.g., object types, properties) to improve intention inference.",
    "The group discussed the general specification and case design, initially considering materials like plastic, wood, latex, and titanium. A curved or double-curved case design was favored for its fashion appeal. However, titanium was later ruled out for curved designs due to manufacturing limitations. The final decision was to use wood for the case, based on its environmentally friendly nature and potential for customization, such as allowing customers to design their own cases.\n\nThe concept of changeable cases, similar to mobile phone covers, was also discussed. The idea was to have a plastic shell with a rubber cover in fruit and vegetable colors, offering a spongy feel and allowing for easy design changes. This would allow for cheap design changes. The rubber casing would also provide grip, helping prevent repetitive stress injuries.\n",
    "Huw David's views on the Bill, as gleaned from the meeting transcripts, can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Unintended Consequences:** Huw David acknowledges the potential for unintended consequences but believes they can be avoided with careful implementation and adequate resources. He emphasizes the importance of cultural change alongside legislation.\n\n**Need for Legislation:** He believes the Bill is a reflection of a cultural change in Wales, where most parents do not support physical punishment. He states that the state's role is to protect children from harm, and physical punishment is considered harm. He notes the current legislation is unclear and the Bill would provide clarity for very vulnerable children who are currently being assaulted.\n\n**Explicitly Stated in the Bill:** Huw David does not explicitly comment on whether certain aspects should be explicitly stated in the Bill. However, he stresses the importance of awareness-raising campaigns and support for parents who struggle with parenting. He advocates for a universal offer of support to every parent in Wales.\n",
    "The group discussed the design and functionality of a two-sided remote control, focusing on three prototypes: the \"rhombus,\" the \"potato,\" and the \"Martian.\" The \"potato\" design seemed to gain the most traction.\n\nEvaluation criteria included uniqueness, functionality, creativity, ease of use, spongy quality (due to the latex/rubber material), integration of \"fruity\" colors, design matching behavior (channel flipping and volume), and RSI prevention. The absence of a \"lost remote\" feature was noted as a concern, although the bright colors were seen as a partial solution. A suggestion to include an external device that would beep when the remote was lost was deemed technologically difficult.\n\nMarket range considerations included targeting middle-aged customers who might not want \"fruity\" colors but still need a bright design to prevent loss. The group also discussed the need for the remote to have a corporate logo and potentially a conservative color scheme alongside more vibrant options.\n\nTechnical requirements like water-proof and shock-proof capabilities were initially considered, with the idea of including a waterproof box or plastic protection, but this was not explicitly decided. The group also considered the possibility of a kinetic battery.\n",
    "Group 3, regarding regulation-making powers in the Bill, is not included in the meeting transcript. Therefore, I am unable to provide a summary of the discussions and opinions on the amendments in group 3 regarding the regulation-making powers in the Bill, including Suzy Davies' views on amendment 3A.",
    "Regarding Brexit's impact on higher education in Wales, institutions are concerned about potential effects on fee and access plans due to fluctuating EU student recruitment. To prepare, executives engage in scenario planning and risk assessments, focusing on securing funding and maintaining student mobility. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) collaborates with institutions to monitor their preparedness and financial stability. Student interests are protected through close collaboration with the National Union of Students (NUS) Wales and measures outlined in student charters.\n\nQuestions arose concerning the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks, but the transcript does not provide any information about these matters.\n\nThe transcript also does not provide any information on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the key points regarding the role of the middle tier (municipalities) and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada are as follows:\n\n**Municipalities:**\n*   Municipalities are facing rising costs and reduced revenues due to the pandemic, leading to potential service cutbacks.\n*   The federal government acknowledges the importance of supporting municipalities but emphasizes that funding primarily flows through the provinces, respecting the Constitution.\n*   Transit systems, crucial for essential workers, are particularly affected, and there's a call for federal intervention to safeguard transit services.\n\n**Support for the Elderly and Vulnerable:**\n*   The government recognizes the challenges faced by seniors during the pandemic, including concerns about physical and financial security.\n*   Measures taken include reducing minimum RRIF withdrawals and making CERB available to working seniors who lost jobs.\n*   There's a focus on protecting seniors in long-term care homes, with concerns raised about outbreaks and the quality of care.\n*   The Canadian Armed Forces have been deployed to assist long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario.\n*   There are concerns about the for-profit model of long-term care and calls for removing profit from the sector.\n\n",
    "The marketing expert initially doesn't see the market niche for the product, particularly the television-only remote, without something special to set it apart. They question the elimination of teletext without a compelling replacement feature. The expert suggests that if the remote is marketed for beauty and design, it should be priced higher. They express a need for a marketing niche, especially for a mid-market-priced product, and advocate for something that changes people's thinking to see the product as advantageous.\n\nLater, the marketing expert shows enthusiasm for an environmentally sensitive product, such as one with a charging cradle instead of replaceable batteries, which could be a strong selling point. They also suggest exploring multiple designs to cater to different tastes. Overall, the marketing expert emphasizes the importance of a unique selling proposition and a clear market niche for the product to succeed.\n",
    "The main points discussed regarding the universal adoption, advantages, and weaknesses of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 included:\n\n*   **Universal Adoption:** There were different views on whether the Act had fulfilled all of the government's objectives.\n*   **Advantages:** It was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Concerns that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough and that the government has had to drive some of its objectives through the annual remit letter. Also, it was suggested that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfill any requirements. The powers of intervention were inflexible and hard to use. It did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity.",
    "The group discussed and presented an evaluation criteria for a remote control design. The criteria included factors such as fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, fashion, ease of finding, and robustness, each rated on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being high and 7 being low.\n\nDuring the evaluation, the group agreed on ratings for each criterion, considering aspects like the remote's design, materials, and functionality. They aimed to balance cost-effectiveness with desired features, making compromises where necessary. They also discussed the remote's potential marketability and alignment with current user requirements and market trends. The marketing representative used user research and market analysis to create the criteria. The goal was to assess how well the design met the initial objectives and market demands.",
    "Regarding the participants' opinions on using CDs for backup, it was generally agreed that while CDs are acceptable for distribution, they are not reliable for long-term backup due to the limited lifespan of write-once burners. There was a suggestion to use CDs in conjunction with tape backups, but the consensus leaned towards using tape for archiving.\n\nIn terms of the discussion on probability computation, the participants were exploring the use of a belief net to infer user intentions (View, Enter, or Tango) in a computer navigation system. The discussion involved identifying relevant features from language, discourse, and context to feed into the belief net, and how these features could be extracted from parsed speech or other sources. The challenge lies in determining the conditional probabilities and structure of the belief net.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system involves a user interacting with a simulated environment (3D model or animation) and a computer system or human operator to solve tasks like finding locations or taking pictures. The user's interactions are recorded, and the system is designed to infer the user's intention based on their language, context, and other factors. The data collected will be used to train and evaluate the belief net for intention inference.\n",
    "The team decided against symmetrical buttons because the User Interface team member pointed out that it might make the remote more difficult to use.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating both right- and left-handed versions of the remote. However, the team ultimately decided against this idea, as the functions of the remote were deemed basic enough that users would not have any problems using a standard design regardless of their dominant hand. The team felt a single, normal-shaped remote would suffice.\n",
    "The group discussed cost reduction strategies extensively, focusing on staying within the \u20ac12.50 budget. They explored abandoning certain features to lower costs. The initial design included a special \"surfing board\" shape, but the project manager stressed the need to redesign if the budget was exceeded.\n\nFeature abandonment was a key point. The group considered a basic remote with only ten digits, costing around \u20ac8, but also discussed more advanced options. The advanced remote included an LCD screen, speech recognition, and a tactile cover, but these drove the cost up to sixteen francs, plus an additional three francs for the S_R_ system.\n\nTo reduce production costs, the team debated removing the LCD screen, speech recognition, and special colors. They explored using standard, off-the-shelf components and considered a plastic casing instead of rubber to save money. The final decision involved scrapping speech recognition and offering custom covers separately to maintain the basic functionality within budget. The absence of the LCD screen was also debated.\n",
    "The voice recognition system was trained on Switchboard data, which is telephone conversations. The pros mentioned are that the system got the genders correct and the initial results were encouraging. It was noted that the transcripts are very good and the system allows for automatic conversion from XML to chopping up waveforms. The word recognition was good, which means that the force alignments should be good.\n\nThe cons mentioned are that the language model for Switchboard is totally different, so there are a lot of errors. There is no language model for PZM (or other specific terms like Jimlet), so every time someone says PZM it's an error. Also, the acoustic models were from Switchboard, so they didn't have anything from the acoustic data in the meetings. The lapel microphone was not as good of quality and the placement of the microphones can vary from speaker to speaker.",
    "The Industrial Designer (Kate) addressed battery options, noting company constraints. Initial ideas included standard AA and AAA batteries, which were deemed too bulky. Dynamo charging was dismissed as impractical (\"a bit silly\"). Solar charging was considered, but questioned regarding effectiveness with artificial light. Kinetic charging, similar to wristwatches, was suggested, with the benefit of constant charging from movement.\n\nThe team discussed the life of the kinetic battery, compatibility of solar charging with standard batteries, and the size/durability of solar cells.\n\nUltimately, the team decided to go with a long-term battery source, but with the aim of making the design a fashion statement so that \"people are more likely to change it anyway before it runs out.\"\n\nFor the industrial working design, the Industrial Designer recommended a charger due to the extended battery life and the convenience of recharging, similar to mobile phones. This eliminates the need for frequent battery replacements.\n",
    "The project manager indicated that the project was included in a conference paper because they took one step for every decision made and then the conclusion. The criteria for the paper were based on user requirements, trends from marketing research, and the marketing strategy of the company. The operating behavior of the young user was also defined in color and shape and the use of the LCD screen. The project manager also stated that he has to make a report of every decision they made so far and that he had already started.",
    "Kirsty Williams did not directly address the funding allocated to the consortia but acknowledged that some regional consortia services performed highly while others needed to improve. She emphasized the necessity of larger units for successful school improvement work, deeming it reckless to revert to school improvement services being delivered individually.\n\nRegarding university governance, Williams acknowledged that the HE Act did not directly address governance issues but highlighted HEFCW's established assurance practices. She sought a direct relationship with university chairs and supported an independent review of governance by Universities Wales and HEFCW. She supports exploring how the PCET Bill could introduce a regulatory condition for good governance.\n\nWilliams did not directly respond to university mergers.\n\nThe transcripts do not contain any mention of admission problems in Welsh universities.\n",
    "The team discussed the energy source for the remote, evaluating battery, kinetic, and solar options. While kinetic energy was appealing for its user-friendliness and potential marketing advantages (connecting movement with the sedentary activity of watching TV), the team recognized the need for more technical and cost information. Ultimately, they decided to use a simple battery.\n\nRegarding technological innovation, the team decided to incorporate voice recognition and an LCD screen with a spinning wheel for enhanced user experience and to align with market trends favoring technologically advanced features. They also agreed to include a sample speaker for audio feedback.\n\nOverall, the team aimed for a design that balanced style and functionality, combining push-buttons on the exterior with an LCD screen and spinning wheel inside a curved case. They sought to incorporate bright vegetable colors for a trendy look, despite potential cost increases associated with advanced features.\n",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the remote control. For the energy source, they considered batteries, hand dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar cells. They decided to go with simple batteries due to practicality and cost.\n\nRegarding technical issues, they debated between infrared and Bluetooth signals, ultimately opting for the simpler and cheaper infrared technology. They also discussed the integration of a sample speaker for audio feedback, which was developed by their company, and voice recognition.\n\nFor the project announcement email, the team ensured that email addresses were updated for efficient communication.\n\nThe sample sensor was mentioned as a new development from their company, potentially related to voice recognition, though its exact function remained unclear. They considered including it, especially if it didn't significantly increase costs, but its relevance to the remote control's core functionality was questioned.\n",
    "In the last meeting, the team finalized the design of a snowman-shaped remote control. The design was modified to include a small L_C_D_ screen with a scroll wheel and confirm button for accessing advanced functions, such as brightness and contrast, due to cost constraints. The slogan will be placed on the side or bottom of the remote. The remote will primarily be made of plastic, with the rubber buttons being removed to further reduce costs. The team discussed the dimensions, aiming for a size comfortable to hold.\n\nThe team also conducted a design evaluation, rating the design's success in meeting original aims and market research criteria. The team found that the design only met 70% of the original goals. The team also discussed the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, and the usefulness of the technology provided. Concerns were raised about the contrived nature of the creative guidelines, the confining framework of leadership, the limited collaboration due to the meeting structure, and the distracting nature of having multiple computers.",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns regarding the childcare offer. They questioned the \u00a34.50 single national rate, worrying it could create a two-tiered system where wealthier parents can afford better care through add-ons, disadvantaging lower-income families. David and Irranca-Davies discussed the accessibility and affordability for the lowest-income working families, particularly regarding additional charges for transport, trips, food, and snacks. David also inquired about the possibility of piloting the program in Cardiff and Newport, and if the rate would need to vary depending on location. They also discussed the qualification and quality of the workforce, with concerns raised about capacity growth and staffing levels to deliver the offer across Wales.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line and phase normalization involved PhD C and Professor B. PhD C discussed working on on-line normalization with two different means, one for silence and one for speech, controlled by the voice activity detector's probability. He observed that the means were more different for C-zero and C-one coefficients. Professor B suggested looking at the kinds of errors to see if the normalizations were making things better in some ways and worse in others.\n\nRegarding phase normalization, PhD F mentioned trying phase normalization with long-term mean subtraction and getting \"garbage results.\" Grad G talked about unwrapping the phase and dividing out the average complex spectrum, but he got worse results doing that.\n\nRegarding quals, Barry (Grad A) is preparing for his quals and plans to conduct cheating experiments to determine the effectiveness of intermediate categories for classification. He will use perfect knowledge about voicing to set probabilities in LNA files.\n",
    "The discussion focused on identifying key linguistic features for improved speech recognition. Professor G mentioned suggestions from Manolo Pardo and Javier Ferreiros to broaden the approach beyond silence boundaries for detecting speaker change points, incorporating changes in broad phonetic classes.\n\nThe group considered feature streams for speech/non-speech detection, with PhD C detailing the use of a Munich system based on Gaussian mixtures. This system used loudness-based spectrum and additional features like energy and zero-crossing rate. While effective, it doesn't fully address overlapping speech.\n\nThe potential of Noisy-ORs was mentioned in the context of combining different front-end representations for robustness. Saul's approach, using a soft \"AND-OR,\" was discussed as a way to weight different bands based on hidden variables learned with EM, rather than assuming equal strength for all bands.\n\nThe transcription formalization was touched upon regarding the representation of overlaps, with a desire for a more detailed musical score notation. The limitations of the current interface were acknowledged, and the group discussed potential modifications and alternative tools.\n",
    "The discussion focused on system involvement in demos, backups, and note-taking. Grad H discussed THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, including a user interface with keyword search capabilities. Professor B inquired about playback functionality.

Professor B mentioned reserving non-backed-up space for easily recreatable items.\n\nCrossPads for note-taking were discussed, with varying opinions on their usefulness. Postdoc A noted the pen's noise as a disadvantage, while PHD G suggested using them for marking important time periods. Professor B suggested scheduling periods for post-meeting summaries. Grad H pointed out infrastructure challenges with CrossPads. The group explored alternative note-taking methods like a PDA with a wireless card. Professor B suggested returning one of the CrossPads. Overall, Professor B seems willing to experiment with different note-taking methods, but emphasizes the need for someone to \"buy into\" the process and use it consistently.\n",
    "The meeting transcript reveals that the Welsh Government, under Julie Morgan's purview, had been in discussions with HMRC regarding the childcare offer. However, these discussions were suspended due to a primary concern: flexibility. Morgan stated that going through HMRC would restrict the Welsh Government's ability to be flexible and expand the childcare offer. There were also issues raised regarding the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, with Nicola Edwards adding that HMRC operates under a Welsh language scheme, which differs significantly from the standards Welsh Ministers must adhere to. While Morgan acknowledged the technical reasons, she emphasized that the decision was mainly driven by the desire for a more flexible and expandable childcare offer. Sian Gwenllian expressed frustration, noting the committee's previous scrutiny and concerns, suggesting that money had been wasted due to the change in direction.\n",
    "Professor C stated that the goal of the workshop was to distinguish between three kinds of intentions: to view, to enter, or to \"Tango\" with a tourist site. The team's feedback on the person in Grenada was that she did a wonderful job.\n\nThe required elements in the new form arrangement were not directly stated. The new form arrangement should include a specification for some interface that takes the normal M-three-L, looks at it, and looks up more stuff in the ontology and dialogue history.\n\nThe suggested structure of the belief net would have the conditional probability of one of three things as output: that the person wants to view it, enter it, or tango with it. There would also be a need for intermediate nodes.\n\nGrad B felt that if they could get the information, a belief net would be a good way of doing the inferential combination of it.\n",
    "Grad E expressed a positive outlook regarding the SmartKom project, noting its functionality and potential for collaboration, particularly with individuals like Ralf and Tilman.

However, Grad A was involved in a discussion on a formalism and agreed to try to get a first cut at the revised formalism by the end of the following week.\n",
    "The User Interface team pushed for a simpler remote design with fewer functions, emphasizing ease of use. They suggested a simple formatted display to achieve the functionality of a complicated device.\n\nThe final decision was to create a sleek, simple functioned remote control aimed at a younger demographic, with optional \"bells and whistles\" available. The remote would have a plastic case and a touch screen with several submenus, and the basic functions (on/off, channels, volume) easily accessible. Voice recognition for simple functions was also agreed upon.\n\nRadio wave interference was a concern, leading to the decision to use plastic instead of metal for the casing. There was discussion of using the extra budget for a touch screen and cutting-edge battery technology, but ultimately, the team decided to move forward with the touch screen option.\n",
    "The professor believes that mean cepstral subtraction can be viewed as a high-pass or band-pass filter. He suggests that constraining the filter to only subtract the mean might be limiting, as filters have diverse temporal and spectral behaviors. He emphasized the importance of eliminating very low-frequency components.\n\nRegarding additive noise, the professor noted that the test largely involved additive noise, but they didn't explicitly address it, relying on RASTA-like filtering in the log domain to handle convolutional noise. He suggested that spectral subtraction schemes could be beneficial.\n\nIn terms of smoothing, the professor mentioned that adding noise after spectral subtraction can be problematic in finding the right level. He also raised concerns about averaging stationary and non-stationary noise together, arguing against simple averaging.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function, focusing on user needs and desires. The remote should primarily serve as a TV remote, excluding DVD and other device controls to simplify the design process. The channel selection function is the most used function on the remote.\n\nThe kinetic function was explored, particularly the idea of a wheel for incremental channel and volume control. The group also considered the possibility of a \"previous channel\" button for quick switching between channels. There was also a discussion of the ability to roll through channels, possibly organized into categories or a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "The team proposed a remote design with nine channel buttons, a next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, and a switch to control features like color contrast and sharpness. Voice recognition was a key feature. The case would be strong, recyclable plastic, and colorful, with soft rubber buttons and a fluorescent green LED for the menu button.\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing agreed that visual appeal was crucial. Marketing emphasized a small, easy-to-use, and eye-catching design to beat the competition. The Industrial Designer's proposal centered around a user-friendly design with easily accessible raised buttons and a prominent on/off button.\n\nMarketing found the prototype promising, liking the biomorphic shape, soft feel, and small size.

Overall, marketing considered the design highly marketable and well-suited for international appeal, with the shape and practicality of use being key aspects.\n",
    "Grad G's and the professor's opinions can be extracted from the transcripts. Regarding capturing the subject's intention, Grad G presented a belief-net structure for intention recognition, categorizing it into \"tour\" or \"business.\" The professor thought that the Bayes-nets will be decision-specific for each decision.\n\nOn the topic of MSG, there was no discussion.\n\nAs for pronouncing zero, Grad D noted the system starts counting from zero, while others start from one.\n\nRegarding hiring Fey, Grad E mentioned Fey agreed to rewrite the German concept syntax-to-prosody rules. Grad D inquired about Fey's Scheme programming skills, while Grad E expressed confidence in Fey's ability to manage with a commented version of the file. The professor and Grad B agreed Fey could be given more hours per week.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer expressed several thoughts on the remote control's design and technologies. Regarding appearance, they suggested exploring titanium for its good look, but acknowledged manufacturing limitations with double-curved shapes. They were open to rubber elements for feel, inspired by cell phone designs, and favored simple push buttons over LCDs to reduce costs.\n\nOn technology, the Industrial Designer supported including speech recognition, aiming to find simple and cost-effective solutions within the budget. They mentioned speaker-dependent technology for household use and acknowledged potential cost increases with color LCDs, suggesting users could pay extra for customization.\n\nConcerning new technologies like Bluetooth, the Industrial Designer did not mention Bluetooth, but explored the possibility of incorporating a location feature. Overall, the Industrial Designer aimed for a balance between aesthetics, functionality, cost-effectiveness, and user-friendliness, leaning towards established technologies to keep the price down.\n",
    "The discussions on the priority of inspections were primarily centered around the urgency of addressing systemic racism within national institutions. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders agreed that there was a need to prioritize inspections to root out white supremacist groups within Canadian police forces.\n\nJustin Trudeau elaborated on the governmental fund by emphasizing the need for a full-scale overhaul of the RCMP to tackle systemic racism. He stated that they needed to be better at where they spend money, investing in communities and not policing. While acknowledging the existence of systemic racism in all institutions, Trudeau expressed confidence in the RCMP Commissioner's ability to make strides in addressing the issue.\n",
    "The group discussed the technical and functional designs, prototype presentation, detailed design, and specific designing requirements of the remote control.\n\nThe industrial designer presented initial ideas, including user requirements such as turning the TV on/off with one button press, establishing a corporate image, and considering materials for reliability and appearance. They drew inspiration from past remote controls, like Zenith's Flashmatic, and suggested features like size adjustability, waterproof design, and audio cues to confirm actions.\n\nThe project manager emphasized unbreakable designs for families with kids. The marketing team suggested a sales price of twenty-five Euro and a production price of twelve and a half Euro. They noted a willingness among younger demographics (15-35) to pay more for trendy features like speech recognition.\n\nThe user interface team highlighted the need to minimize button clutter and prioritize frequently used buttons. They suggested sleek, simple designs. The team also explored the possibility of radio waves, LCD screens, and speech recognition, and the use of a touch screen. The group also considered the importance of making the remote accessible to older users, possibly through larger buttons or a simplified interface.\n",
    "The team's discussion and evaluation of the project's process, work division, and production plan revealed several key points. Regarding the process, there was some initial feeling of being stifled creatively by the company's restriction to a TV remote design. However, the team generally agreed they had control over the design and technological aspects.\n\nTeamwork was viewed positively, despite minor annoyances with certain tools like digital pens. The team felt they had a good dynamic. The project manager was praised for their leadership. There was a discussion about the means used, with a suggestion to utilize the whiteboard more effectively.\n\nThe production plan involved using plastic for the remote's body, soft rubber for the buttons, and a fluorescent green LED for the menu button. The team considered different battery options, ultimately deciding on a lithium battery. There was also discussion around the number of interfaces and buttons needed, balancing functionality with cost. They were aiming for a product that was small, easy to use, and eye-catching, with voice recognition as a key selling point. The final design was a snail shape.\n",
    "Future directions focused on testing the tandem approach, multilingual models, and feature extraction. PhD D explained their multilingual model, which involved training neural networks on TI-digits English, Italian data, and broad English, French, and Spanish databases.

They also discussed the human subjects implications of releasing the data.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement highlights a critical concern regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: the potential disconnect between the Bill's development and its practical implementation. While the Deputy Minister is confident in the strategic implementation group's ability to address potential issues, Ms. Kwan is pointing out that the implementation group hasn't yet developed a comprehensive strategy that could persuade people about what implementing this Bill would look like in real life. She is suggesting that the public is being asked to take a chance on this Bill.\n\nThis gap raises questions about the Bill's timing and effectiveness, as the implementation strategy is still under development. Ms. Kwan is asking why the Bill is being introduced now when the implementation group hasn't really come up with a strategy that could help persuade people about what implementing this Bill would look like in real life.\n",
    "The Project Manager viewed the last meeting review positively, noting that the evaluation of the on/off switches and the product, in general, was useful. The Project Manager felt the team was able to fulfill the initial criteria for the product's design. However, the Project Manager felt they got too into the project management role, but thought it was a good thing.\n\nThe group had a different opinion of the project's progress than the Project Manager. The group felt there were constraints and limited room for creativity due to budget restrictions and contrived guidelines like fashion trends and fruit/vegetable color schemes. They felt the meetings were more like brainstorming sessions, but the room wasn't conducive to collaboration.\n\nThere is no mention of the group discussing using a panther as a drawing.\n",
    "The team had varied opinions on the remote control's features. The industrial designer favored soft-touch or touch screen buttons to avoid damage to rubber buttons. The user interface designer suggested a simple remote with essential functions applicable to multiple appliances, while the marketing representative suggested that the team consider the age of the target demographic. Younger people were thought to be more interested in LCD screens and speech recognition, while older people were not. \n\nThe team agreed that the volume and channel buttons were the most important.

The components include an advanced chip to support an LCD screen and voice recognition. The case will be curved on one side and flat on the other, with a plastic shell and rubber coating for grip. The user interface will have push-buttons on the outside for basic functions, and an LCD screen with a spinning wheel on the inside for advanced features. The team decided to incorporate voice recognition. The design should use company colors and an implied fruit shape. The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer will collaborate on a prototype, using modeling clay and instructions from their personal coach.\n",
    "The decision was made to hold off on working with MSG due to complications and focus on PLP features. The paper contains results from experiments conducted to improve speech recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments. Various neural network configurations and training datasets were used, including multi-English, French, Spanish, and TIMIT. The statistics included recognition accuracy rates under different conditions (matched vs. mismatched noise, different training sets, etc.). The results showed that delta features are important, and while multi-English training generally performed well, there was a performance loss when training on conditions different from the test conditions. The paper also explored combining different feature streams and the impact of online normalization. Ultimately, the goal is to plug the system into the OGI system and improve its robustness across various languages and noise conditions.\n",
    "The group agreed to analyze the digits corpus using three dimensions: feature, training data, and test data. The features considered were PLP, MFCCs, and JRASTA-LDA. For training data, they planned to use TI-digits, Italian, French, and Finnish tasks, training neural networks on task-specific data and broader, phonetically balanced data from the same language when possible. They also discussed using the OGI multilingual database. For testing, they planned to use the same corpora as Aurora, with future German and Danish testing.\n\nThe current technique involved a tandem approach, training neural nets to produce discriminative features for HTK training. However, there were limitations regarding cross-language applicability and potential acoustic mismatches. Progress included reinstalling HTK to version 3.0, transforming TIMIT transcriptions for training, and planning a subset of phonemes common to all training languages.\n\nDelays were anticipated due to the time required for HTK training (around 6 hours) and neural net training (around 1 day) on a single machine. They discussed using multiple machines and the SPERT board to speed up the process.\n",
    "In the product naming discussion, \"triple R\" was considered superior to \"triple RC\" because the \"RC\" at the end was believed to detract from the image of the remote control.\n\nThe target age group was concluded to be 15 to 35 years old. This decision was influenced by survey data indicating that younger people (15-25) showed a higher willingness to pay for features like voice recognition. While those aged 25-35 were also considered, the marketing team acknowledged that the younger demographic had a higher disposable income. The marketing team decided to target young people because they are more open to trendy designs and new technologies like voice recognition.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection was not summarized in the meeting transcript.\n",
    "The group discussed market research indicating that 80% of users would spend more on a fancy remote, but 50% only use 10% of the buttons. This led to a design focus on simplification and a modern appearance. Key desired features included a tracking device to prevent loss and user-friendly buttons, possibly with less-used buttons hidden.\n\nDesign opinions diverged, with some favoring a universal remote and others a TV-specific one. The group considered a rounded shape to fit in the hand, possibly with a detachable \"zapping\" device for basic functions. Ergonomics, button size, and ambidextrous design were also discussed.\n\nThe necessity of revolution in remote control interaction was a recurring theme. The user interface expert emphasized the need to revolutionize the look and feel, including materials, button placement, and overall shape. The group explored features like speech recognition and LCD screens, but concerns arose about cost and practicality. The group agreed they wanted it to be a universal remote that everyone would want.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM outlined a plan for quality assurance involving \"quality improvement practitioners\" who would participate in workshops to provide feedback. Bethan Owen highlighted the \"high-risk category\" of students, likely referring to those most vulnerable during school closures. Kirsty Williams explained five principles guiding school reopening decisions: prioritizing safety and well-being, aligning with the broader government response, ensuring clear communication, determining which groups should return, and addressing practical operational challenges. She also set expectations for new examinations and school qualifications, with teachers submitting grades based on available data, moderated to ensure fairness and robustness. Finally, Kirsty Williams addressed doubts about the sufficiency of their actions by emphasizing that they were working on a four-nation basis, consulting with medical advisors, and learning from other countries' educational approaches.\n",

Creativity felt more like a formality.\n*   **Meeting Structure:** The meetings were viewed as brainstorming sessions lacking a structure for idea evaluation, feedback, and review.\n*   **Technology Issues:** PowerPoint presentations were seen as a hindrance, and there was a feeling that too many computers were distracting. The digital pens were described as clunky.\n*   **Limited Collaboration:** The team felt that they could only discuss things in the meetings.\n*   **Role Definition:** One team member expressed uncertainty about their role.",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments revolved around its implementation within the SmartKom system. Initial tests involved using 12 seconds of past and present speech to calculate the mean, with a slight performance drop compared to a centered window. Experiments were conducted to assess the impact of varying the duration used for mean subtraction during training and testing. It was found that training with a longer duration (e.g., 12 seconds) didn't necessarily benefit performance when testing with shorter durations. The team also considered the idea of incrementally building up the mean over time, starting with shorter durations and gradually increasing it. There was also a discussion around viewing mean cepstral subtraction as a filter to remove low-frequency components and whether the mean should neglect silence regions. The team also discussed doing a second pass with a longer time version of mean subtraction, especially if the first pass had errors.\n",
    "The discussion included several topics. Mixed signals were mentioned regarding whether to adjust for different feature sets, and it was decided that phd A would contact Joe about the issue. VAD improvements were discussed, with the goal of reducing latency, and it was noted that adding LDA online normalization increased latency. VAD results were presented, showing a 57.02% improvement, and the best possible improvement with a \"cheating\" VAD was 62%. Postdoc A's opinion on new headphones was not explicitly stated, but it was mentioned that the transcribers had good headphones. Alternative methods to increase space were discussed, including musical score notation and modifications to the interface, but they ultimately decided to continue with the current method due to time constraints. The deadline for getting eleven hours of transcription done was set for the end of the month.\n",
    "In the meeting transcripts, special schools are discussed in the context of the \"new purpose\" arrangement during the pandemic. The aim is to ensure that even vulnerable children attending special schools receive the necessary support. It's acknowledged that many special school children have already been affected due to their conditions requiring isolation. Despite the broader approach of regional consortia, it's emphasized that support should be provided through the special school itself. There is a discussion about the need to cater for children within their original school settings, given the nature of special schools and the challenges of social distancing in different environments.\n",
    "The User Interface Designer, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager discussed a prototype for a television remote control. The User Interface Designer suggested it should be a universal remote that works on different TVs and devices, but the Project Manager corrected them, stating it needed to be a TV remote control only, specifically for kids and elderly people.\n\nThe discussion focused on the technical functions and design considerations, including button functionality, interoperability, and potential features like speech recognition. The team explored ideas for making the remote trendy and user-friendly, drawing inspiration from mobile phone designs and considering the needs of older users.

    "The segmenter, presumably Thilo's segmenter, is working \"so well\" and is being used to produce automatic segmentations for meeting recognition. The team wants to transition to using automatic segmentations instead of hand-segmentations for recognition experiments, as hand-segmentations are considered \"cheating.\" The segmenter has high recall, which is beneficial because over-generation allows for training noise models in the recognizer. A sample meeting has been run through Thilo's segmenter and sent to transcribers to see if it fixes the problem of too many beeps in the last transcription.",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the Industrial Designer and User Interface (UI) designer disagreed on the price because the Industrial Designer prioritized adherence to the company's strategy and limited resources, while the UI designer likely focused on incorporating trendy features and aesthetics, potentially increasing costs.\n\nThe UI designer disagreed on the redesign after product evaluation because they felt their initial design was already very creative and met the user requirements. They may have felt that flattening the shape to save costs would compromise the design's appeal and functionality.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as basic colors for the product appearance to align with the company's color scheme and the trendy fruit and vegetable theme.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the UI designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance because they believed limiting the product to fruit shapes would limit customer choice and market appeal, as consumers in other markets prefer a range of shapes.\n",
    "Kay Martin and Nick Brazil both express concerns about the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment. Kay Martin states employers are primarily interested in ensuring learners obtain the right qualifications, especially core professional qualifications alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. She indicates the Welsh bac is not the best program for engaging employers at her college.\n\nNick Brazil questions whether the skills employers require are truly being developed through the Welsh bac, noting that employers on their boards rarely mention it, focusing instead on professional qualifications and skills. He acknowledges the initial vision for the Welsh bac was good, but it has become overly rigorous, bureaucratic, and focused on outcomes rather than skills.\n\nDafydd Evans admits employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac's meaning or content. He suggests renaming the qualification to \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" for better comprehension. He emphasizes the need to review the qualification with employer input to ensure employability and entrepreneurial skills are prioritized.\n",
    "The team discussed additional ideas and presentations focusing on the function and working design of a new remote control. The industrial designer suggested user requirements, including turning the TV on/off with one press of a big button, establishing corporate image through popular design, and considering appropriate and reliable materials.

They also mentioned the user perspective is important and how it ties into the other two comments.\n\nThe team also talked about the lemon or lime color and theme, a snowman shape, and kinetic power.\n",
    "The Project Manager considered the market range to be wide, spanning various consumer demographics and age groups. They emphasized the importance of accessibility and reflecting the company's image. Regarding price, the project aimed for an attractive impulse purchase at 25 Euros, with a cost not exceeding 12.50 Euros.\n\nFor new features proposed by Marketing, the Project Manager expressed interest in unique selling points beyond basic TV functions, such as controlling lighting or incorporating a \"notes\" feature for desired viewing content. They acknowledged the need for further market research to tailor the product to different markets globally.\n\nThe Project Manager acknowledged that the multipurpose remote control could be too complex and would only control the TV, and the corporate image should be maintained. They were concerned about cost constraints and the financial target of 50 million Euros in sales. Setting a selling target was deemed necessary, and the initial focus would be on a mid-range, business-oriented demographic while considering different designs for varied markets. The Project Manager planned to explore options like removable plastic cases for customization.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) had several thoughts on the cost constraints, financial targets, and replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project. UI initially considered titanium material for the remote, influenced by the minimalist and shiny aesthetics of iPods. Regarding cost constraints, UI favored a simple interface with a few buttons corresponding to a screen on the television, deeming an iPod-style display on the remote too expensive.\n\nUI thought kinetic energy was attractive as a power source, making the remote lighter and more convenient. However, UI acknowledged the need to consider the cost and development requirements of kinetic batteries. UI also liked push buttons.\n\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements on future product ideas for several reasons. Firstly, Marketing emphasized the importance of a \"fancy look and feel\" driven by current trends, like a fruit and vegetable theme with a spongy texture. The Industrial Designer was hesitant, concerned about the product's longevity and practicality, and the Industrial Designer seemed to prefer a style that would not go out of style so quickly.\n\nSecondly, they disagreed on kinetic energy. The Industrial Designer questioned the practicality of kinetic energy for a remote, as it would require constant tapping, which might frustrate users. Marketing suggested using rubber to get kinetic energy easier, but the Industrial Designer noted that rubber cases prevent using solar cells as an energy source.\n\nFinally, there were disagreements on the upgradability of the product. The Industrial Designer preferred not to use advanced chips unless necessary to minimize costs, while Marketing wanted to focus on trendy features like LCD screens and voice recognition, which required advanced chips.

    "The meeting transcripts reveal significant discussions regarding HEFCW's powers of intervention within the higher education sector in Wales. HEFCW communicated that their powers were inflexible and difficult to use for swift interventions, sometimes describing them as \"threatening.\" They suggested that there were only three steps on the \"dial\" for HEFCW's powers. The Minister acknowledged this feedback and expressed a desire for the new tertiary education commission to have more flexible, \"soft\" regulatory powers, including advice, guidance, and enhanced monitoring, alongside more punitive measures for serious issues.\n\nConversations touched on HEFCW's existing powers being more than just \"leaning on an institution,\" with a clear escalation system. Concerns were raised about the balance between institutional autonomy and accountability, with some feeling the legislation favored autonomy too heavily. The Minister defended HEFCW's actions in supporting institutions through challenging times, trusting their judgment in using their powers appropriately. Overall, the discussions indicate a move towards a more graduated and flexible approach to intervention, balancing institutional autonomy with the need for accountability and national outcomes.\n",
    "The marketing strategy revolves around creating a fashionable and user-friendly universal remote control, targeting an international market.

The marketing team plans to conduct market research to determine the target audience and market size. They are considering different sales channels, including online sales, to reduce storage and transportation costs. There is also discussion of partnering with other companies, such as Sony Pictures, to promote the product and increase sales. The group plans to test market the product and will evaluate the results of these tests to improve the product before a full production run.\n",
    "The discussion addressed several key areas: policies, measures, physical education, and food provision for free-school-meal children during the pandemic.\n\nThe Welsh Government closed schools but purposed to provide safe places for vulnerable children and children of key workers. Schools were expected to identify and support these children, including those on the at-risk register and young carers. Headteachers retained discretion to include children they knew to be in need.\n\nThe provision of free school meals was a priority, with schools and local authorities developing emergency plans to ensure continuity. The aim was to create a seamless system where provision would continue regardless of whether it was term time or the Easter holiday period.\n\nThere was a discussion about how to make physical education more engaging for children, focusing on enjoyable activities and a population approach to driving physical activity. It was suggested that statutory guidance for schools on physical education might be needed.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer expressed no personal view on providing free school meals to all pupils, but agreed that ensuring access to food and improving the quality of food were important. He mentioned innovative practices in schools where children were rewarded for bringing healthy options in their packed lunches.\n",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design for the remote control to enhance user comfort and ease of use. This was aligned with the marketing survey findings indicating that users preferred fancy, good-looking remote controls and found existing ones difficult to operate.\n\nThe agreement on \"easy to use,\" \"fashion,\" \"easy to find,\" and \"robust\" features stemmed from a combination of user needs identified in the marketing survey and the company's design philosophy. \"Easy to use\" addressed the frustration with complicated remotes. \"Fashion\" catered to the desire for aesthetically pleasing designs, aligning with the company's motto of putting fashion into electronics. \"Easy to find\" aimed to solve the common problem of lost remotes, potentially through features like glow-in-the-dark material or voice-activated responses. \"Robust\" was to ensure the remote could withstand common abuse, like being dropped or thrown.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by examining existing designs and identifying their flaws. They considered sleek, modern aesthetics, ergonomic shapes, and the use of color to create a trendy and appealing product. The discussion involved exploring different materials and finishes, such as titanium, rubber, and spongy textures, to achieve a balance between visual appeal, tactile comfort, and durability.\n"
