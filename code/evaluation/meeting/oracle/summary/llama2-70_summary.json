    "  The discussion on latency in the system revolves around the idea of using a mean subtraction technique to improve the accuracy of speech recognition in noisy environments. Professor C suggests that the system should use a longer time window for calculating the mean, such as 12 seconds, to capture more context and reduce the impact of noise. However, Grad E points out that using a longer time window may not always be effective, as the speech signal may change significantly over time.\n\nTo address this issue, Grad E proposes using a shorter time window, such as 2-4 seconds, and adjusting the mean calculation accordingly. This approach could potentially provide a better trade-off between noise reduction and speech recognition accuracy.\n\nProfessor C also raises the concern that the system may not always have access to 12 seconds of speech, particularly in situations where the speaker is interrupted or there are background noises. In such cases, the system may need to use a shorter time window or employ a different approach to handle the variability in speech signals.\n\nThe duration of the latency in the system is not explicitly mentioned in the discussion, but it appears to be a key consideration in the design of the system. The longer time window proposed by Professor C would likely result in a longer latency period, which could affect the system's ability to provide real-time feedback to the user. Grad E's suggestion to use a shorter time window could potentially reduce the latency, but it may also compromise the accuracy of the speech recognition.",

    "  Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, provided insight into the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. He explained that the sector is facing uncertainty regarding the future of EU student applications and funding, as well as the potential impact of the Augar review in England on Welsh higher education. Blaney mentioned that there has been an 8% decrease in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, which he attributes to the change in student support arrangements for EU students. Additionally, there has been a 9% decrease in non-EU student applications, which may be due to a combination of factors such as the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile and the perception of how welcome overseas and international students are. Blaney emphasized that it is difficult to be definitive about the reasons behind the decline in applications and that the sector is working with the government to address these issues.",
    "  The domains in the mental spaces refer to the different categories or concepts that the AI system uses to represent and understand the world. These domains include things like objects, actions, and events, and they are organized into a hierarchical structure with more general categories at the top and more specific ones below. For example, the domain of \"objects\" might include subcategories like \"animals,\" \"vehicles,\" and \"buildings,\" while the domain of \"actions\" might include subcategories like \"run,\" \"jump,\" and \"throw.\"\n\nThe middle layer of the system is responsible for handling the relationships between these domains. It takes the raw data from the input layer, which represents the sensory information from the environment, and passes it through a series of processing steps that allow the system to understand and interpret the data. This process involves applying various rules and constraints to the data, such as grammatical and syntactical rules for natural language processing, or visual and auditory recognition algorithms for image and speech processing.\n\nThe output of the middle layer is a set of propositions that represent the system's understanding of the input data. These propositions are then passed to the output layer, which generates a response based on the system's goals and plans. The output layer might generate a verbal response, such as a sentence or phrase, or a physical response, such as a robotic action or a display on a screen.\n\nOverall, the middle layer plays a crucial role in the functioning of the AI system, as it allows the system to make sense of the complex and varied data from the environment and to generate appropriate responses based on that data.",

    "  The implementation work for school improvement and raising standards in Wales is ongoing, with a focus on self-evaluation and collaboration between local authorities, schools, and other agencies. The Welsh Government has been working with the OECD to review and improve the education system, with a focus on identifying areas for improvement and implementing effective interventions. The OECD will publish its latest report on Welsh education in March 2023, and the Welsh Government plans to make a statement to the Chamber on the report's findings.\n\nRegarding the powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, local authorities have extensive powers of intervention in schools, including the ability to appoint additional governors, suspend a school's delegated budget, and apply to the Welsh Government to establish an intervention board. The Welsh Government encourages local authorities to use these powers proactively to support schools in need of improvement.\n\nThe national evaluation and improvement resource is being developed to help schools evaluate their performance and identify areas for improvement. The resource is being tested and evaluated ahead of its planned introduction across the system in September 2020. The Welsh Government believes that developing robust self-evaluation skills within schools is crucial to making progress in Welsh education.\n\nThe panel of witnesses noted that the increase in exclusions from school is a complex issue, with factors including challenging behavior, autism spectrum disorder, and lack of capacity in the system. Local authorities are developing strategies for support and reintegration, including tiered approaches to provision, but there is a lag in the system in terms of capacity and consistency. School accountability measures have contributed to the rise in exclusions, and there is a need for a cultural shift in schools to prioritize the well-being of learners. The Welsh Government's capped 9 measure has been introduced to address this issue, and there are signs of improvement in some areas.\n\nLocal authorities are working to engage parents of children and young people who are at risk of becoming EOTAS or are already EOTAS, using a team-around-the-family approach that involves multiple agencies. This approach recognizes that behaviors demonstrated in schools are often symptoms of wider issues in the home environment, and aims to provide holistic support to families. While there is a understanding across Wales, there is still a need for consistent implementation and capacity building across the system.",

    "  The professor's thoughts on the effect of noise on speech frequencies, noise addition, smoothing, FIR filters, and dealing with additive noise can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Noise addition: The professor mentioned that adding noise to the signal can affect the dynamic range, but Dan (a colleague) is confident that the quantization error is not significant.\n2. Smoothing: The professor discussed the use of a simple digital filter, specifically a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of around 20 Hz, to remove low-frequency noise from the signal. This filter has a mild effect on speech frequencies and does not affect the signal above 100 Hz.\n3. FIR filters: The professor mentioned that they have been working on designing new FIR filters that have the same frequency response as the LDA filters but with lower latency. They have implemented IIR filters that have a much lower latency than the LDA filters, but they still need to implement a routine for recursive filtering.\n4. Dealing with additive noise: The professor noted that the PZM mikes have a pretty good roll-off, so they don't need to worry about filtering them. However, they want to ensure that any cheap mikes they use are filtered properly before processing.\n5. Communication: The professor stressed the importance of communication among team members, citing the lack of communication as the reason for the delay in implementing the filters.\n6. Linear phase: The professor mentioned that the filters they designed do not have a linear phase, but they are almost linear. They plan to discuss with Sunil (a colleague) how to take a filter that takes only the past into account.\n7. Reduction of latency: The professor reported that they have reduced the latency of the system by 136 milliseconds, bringing the total latency to 330 milliseconds. They aim to further reduce the latency by improving the downsampling process and adding a nice downsampling filter.\n8. Speech frequencies: The professor noted that the LDA filters are basically low-pass filters that leave a lot of what's above 25 Hz, and they want to ensure that the filters they use do not affect speech frequencies.",
