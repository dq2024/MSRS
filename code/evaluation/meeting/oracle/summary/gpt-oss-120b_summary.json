    "**Changes the group said were needed**\n\n1. **IBM\u2011machine side** \u2013 The \u201ctiny IBM\u201d that is in the lab is only partially populated.  \n   *\u202fAdd the missing processors (the machine was built for eight slots but only two are installed).  \n   *\u202fInstall a Linux environment and get the code compiled and running on it.  \n   *\u202fParallelise the neural\u2011network and HTK training pipelines so they can exploit the extra CPUs.  \n\n2. **Data\u2011collection / participant\u2011form side** \u2013 The current tools are still German\u2011centric.  \n   *\u202fTranslate the ontology entries (object names, descriptions, etc.) into English.  \n   *\u202fModify the transcript\u2011generation script so it can recognise English speaker IDs (or fake IDs that match the existing naming scheme).  \n   *\u202fAdd a separate consent/opt\u2011out clause for participants who do **not** want to see the final transcript.  \n\n**Professor\u2019s opinion on the use of English**\n\nThe professor stressed that the English resources are already essentially ready: \u201cWe have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does.\u201d Apart from the small amount of translation work mentioned above, he sees no obstacle to conducting the discussion and the data\u2011collection work in English. In other words, English can be used without major changes; the remaining effort is only to finish translating the few leftover items.",
    "The team spent most of the meeting trying to pin down how the **user model** and the **situation model** will feed into the belief\u2011net decisions, and where the **user\u2011budget** variable belongs in that picture.  \n\nFrom the user side they agreed that the model must contain at least three distinct pieces of information:  \n\n1. **Raw budget** \u2013 a numeric amount that can change as the user spends money. It is not a static \u201crich/poor\u201d label; it must be updated by external actions (purchases, tickets, etc.) and then mapped into decision\u2011relevant ranges (e.g., \u201ccan afford entry\u201d, \u201ccannot afford\u201d).  \n2. **Financial policy (thriftiness)** \u2013 a qualitative trait such as cheap, average, or spendy that influences how the raw budget is interpreted (a cheap user may refuse a modest\u2011price entry that a spendy user would accept).  \n3. **Interests and state** \u2013 a high\u2011dimensional vector (\u2248500 binary flags) describing what the user likes, plus current energy, time and other resources.\n\nThe situation model supplies constraints that are independent of the user: whether a place is open, accessible, the required time to view it, and whether the activity is free (e.g., \u201cview\u201d vs. \u201center\u201d). These nodes are essentially Boolean or multi\u2011valued status flags (open/closed, indoor/outdoor, etc.).\n\nThe group warned that na\u00efvely connecting every user attribute directly to every decision node would explode the conditional\u2011probability tables. Their solution is to introduce an intermediate **compatibility node** (or \u201cfit\u201d node) that aggregates the relevant user attributes\u2014budget, thriftiness, interests, current energy/time\u2014into a single score that then conditions the endpoint decision. The situation model feeds a separate set of constraints into the same endpoint node.  \n\nThus, the user budget is treated as an **externally updated numeric variable** that must be discretised and combined with the user\u2019s financial policy before influencing the decision. The situation model provides complementary, often binary, constraints. By keeping the two models separate and merging them only at a higher\u2011level compatibility node, the team hopes to avoid combinatorial blow\u2011up while still capturing the essential influence of both user resources and situational factors on the system\u2019s recommendations.",
    "During the special\u2011committee hearings members repeatedly pressed the chair for a clear picture of the Canadian economy, which they described as \u201cin trouble\u201d even before the pandemic and now mired in \u201cextraordinary uncertainty.\u201d  The debate centred on three points: the absence of a formal fiscal update for Parliament, the impact of the crisis on vulnerable sectors such as forestry and soft\u2011wood lumber, and the design of the large\u2011employer emergency financing facility that could reward firms that practice aggressive tax planning.\n\n**Cathy\u202fMcLeod** was bluntly critical.  She reminded the committee that government revenues fell 7.2\u202f% in March, that the economy was already weak, and that the Liberal government had refused to provide an economic update despite other jurisdictions doing so.  McLeod called the silence \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coutrageous,\u201d demanded a soft\u2011wood\u2011lumber transition plan, and warned that the forestry industry was being left without assistance while the government continued to issue petitions without answers.\n\n**Mona\u202fFortier**, the associate minister of finance, framed the situation as a genuine, pandemic\u2011driven shock.  She argued that the government had been \u201copen and transparent,\u201d citing bi\u2011weekly cost\u2011and\u2011status reports on the emergency\u2011response plan, and pledged that a comprehensive economic projection would be released \u201cas soon as it is possible.\u201d  Fortier stressed that the administration was still learning how to balance immediate relief with longer\u2011term fiscal clarity.\n\n**Gabriel\u202fSte\u2011Marie** focused on the financing facility.  He expressed frustration that the programme, while intended to protect jobs, appeared to allow companies that engage in tax evasion or use offshore havens to still qualify for loans.  Ste\u2011Marie said the government \u201chas no tolerance for tax evasion\u201d and that each application would be scrutinised, but he warned that the current design risked rewarding abusive tax practices.\n\nTogether, the exchange highlighted a clash between MPs demanding immediate, detailed economic accounting and the government\u2019s defence that the unprecedented crisis necessitates a cautious, data\u2011driven rollout of information and assistance.",
    "The industrial manager highlighted several tiger traits as inspiration for the remote\u2011control design. First, the animal\u2019s **size and strength** were seen as symbols of a robust, confidence\u2011instilling product that feels solid in the hand yet powerful enough to command a TV. Second, the tiger\u2019s **strategic, well\u2011thought\u2011out hunting style** was praised; the manager suggested the remote should embody a purposeful, efficient interaction flow, where every button and gesture serves a clear, intentional function rather than a haphazard layout. Third, the tiger\u2019s **focus on security and the habit of seeking a hidden, protected spot** was deemed valuable for user\u2011experience design\u2014encouraging features that protect the user\u2019s settings, guard against accidental presses, and perhaps incorporate a \u201cstealth\u201d mode for discreet operation. Finally, the manager mentioned the tiger\u2019s **distinctive stripes**, implying that visual cues or patterned elements could give the remote a recognizable, memorable aesthetic while reinforcing the notion of precision and elegance. In sum, the manager believed that the tiger\u2019s combination of physical presence, purposeful behavior, protective instincts, and iconic markings offered a rich set of attributes to study and translate into a remote control that feels strong, intuitive, secure, and visually distinctive.",
    "The team repeatedly emphasized that the current **Transcriber** interface is a bottleneck for efficient overlap annotation.  Several participants noted that the Tcl\u2011TK waveform display is painfully slow to load and to scroll, especially when more than a few channels are shown.  Because the visual pane must be re\u2011drawn each time a new segment is selected, a simple \u201cclick\u2011to\u2011listen\u201d operation can take three or four minutes, making it impractical for meetings with seven or eight speakers.  The group therefore discussed three possible work\u2011arounds:\n\n1. **Interface extensions** \u2013 Grad\u202fA and Dave\u202fGelbart have already hacked a version that shows a mixed\u2011signal waveform with a separate ribbon for each channel, but even three waveforms become sluggish.  The idea of pre\u2011loading all channels at once (or using X\u2011Waves instead of Transcriber) was raised, but the same speed problem persists.  A more promising suggestion was to add a direct\u2011click shortcut that switches audio without going through the menu, which would cut the \u201cmenu\u2011click\u2011listen\u201d cycle dramatically.\n\n2. **Alternative transcription tools** \u2013 The Munich group was mentioned as having a proprietary multi\u2011channel tool, but it cannot be shared.  Susanne\u202fBurger at CMU reportedly uses an eight\u2011channel system that could be useful, though the team has not yet obtained it.  Praat was brought up as a possible option, but participants felt it was not well suited to their multi\u2011speaker, overlap\u2011heavy data.  X\u2011Waves was also suggested for visualizing individual channels, but it lacks the annotation capabilities of Transcriber.\n\n3. **Conceptual redesign** \u2013 Several members argued that a \u201cmusical\u2011score\u2011style\u201d interface would best capture overlapping speech, because it naturally supports multiple parallel tracks on a single timeline.  They agreed that, if a suitable external tool cannot be found or adapted quickly, the safest short\u2011term path is to modestly extend Transcriber (e.g., Dan\u202fEllis\u2019s hack for channel selection) while continuing to explore the CMU and Munich systems for a longer\u2011term solution.",
    "**Components Design** \u2013 The industrial designer stressed that the remote\u2019s case must combine a hard\u2011plastic shell with a soft\u2011rubber or spongy overlay for a solid, comfortable grip. Push\u2011buttons are the baseline, but a scroll\u2011wheel or an integrated LCD screen would require a regular or advanced chip, respectively. Battery options include a standard AA cell, a kinetic\u2011energy unit (watch\u2011style) or a solar cell, though the latter conflicts with a latex\u2011type case. The team agreed on a simple chip paired with push\u2011buttons to keep costs under \u20ac25, while reserving the LCD and kinetic battery as optional upgrades.\n\n**Market Findings** \u2013 Marketing presented survey data: users prioritize \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d above ease of use, with the top three criteria weighted 2\u202f:\u202f1\u202f:\u202f\u00bd. Younger consumers favor bright, fruit\u2011inspired colours, soft materials and dynamic shapes; older users prefer darker, traditional tones and solid plastics or wood. Core functions (power, channel\u2011up/down, volume) must be large and intuitive, while extra features (menus, parental control, voice recognition) are desirable but secondary.\n\n**Conceptual UI Specifications** \u2013 The UI designer proposed a minimal\u2011button layout: two oversized \u201cskip\u201d buttons, a volume rocker, a power switch and a menu key that brings up an on\u2011screen display on the TV. An optional small LCD on the remote could show channel titles, program guides or a simple menu, but the team noted readability issues in low\u2011light settings. Voice\u2011recognition and programmable profiles were discussed as future add\u2011ons, not baseline.\n\n**Properties & Materials** \u2013 Preferred case materials: injection\u2011molded hard plastic for structural integrity, over\u2011molded with a rubberized, spongy layer for ergonomics. Titanium was mentioned for a premium variant but dismissed for double\u2011curved shells. Colors should echo \u201cfruit and vegetable\u201d palettes (orange, green, red) while retaining the company\u2019s corporate hues on buttons and logos.\n\n**Trend Watching** \u2013 Fashion scouting in Paris and Milan revealed 2025 trends: organic, fruit\u2011shaped motifs, spongy textures, and bold, saturated colours. These trends align with the desired \u201ctrendy\u201d aesthetic and justify the playful colour scheme.\n\n**Interface Contents** \u2013 Core controls: power, channel\u202f\u00b1, volume\u202f\u00b1, numeric entry (optional). Secondary layer: menu navigation, parental\u2011control toggle, possible scrolling wheel for menu browsing, and a small LCD for program info. Voice commands were flagged as a high\u2011tech add\u2011on.\n\n**Remote Components** \u2013 Summary of parts: plastic/rubber case, push\u2011button array, PCB with simple or advanced IC, battery (AA or kinetic), optional speaker for tactile feedback, optional LCD, optional scroll\u2011wheel. All components are stocked off\u2011the\u2011shelf, keeping BOM low.\n\n**Market Trends** \u2013 The market is shifting from purely functional remotes to fashion\u2011forward devices that act as lifestyle accessories. Consumers are willing to pay a modest premium for distinctive colours, soft\u2011touch finishes, and limited smart features, provided price stays near \u20ac25. The team concluded that the final concept should emphasize a curved, rubber\u2011over\u2011plastic shell in bright fruit\u2011inspired colours, large essential buttons, and a simple electronics platform, with the LCD and kinetic battery reserved for a higher\u2011end version.",
    "The early\u2011implementer pilots have proved both useful and cautionary.\u202fOfficials noted that the phased approach allowed the government to \u201clearn live\u2011time\u201d and avoid the \u201cbig\u2011bang\u201d pitfalls seen in England, where technical and volume problems emerged.\u202fThe biggest lesson is the administrative burden placed on local authorities and families: parents must supply wage slips, birth certificates and continually update work\u2011pattern information, which is especially hard for those with complex circumstances.\u202fConsequently, the Minister highlighted a shift toward a more centralised, HMRC\u2011style verification system that would share data across government departments and reduce paperwork for both parents and authorities.\n\nGeographically, demand is uneven.\u202fRural pilot areas such as Gwynedd and Anglesey show strong uptake, while some South\u2011Wales valleys display cultural resistance, with families preferring informal grand\u2011parent care.\u202fThese cultural factors, not capacity constraints, explain the uneven intensity of demand.\u202fThe pilots also revealed that the current seven\u2011area model creates confusion for families outside the pilot zones, who wonder why they cannot yet access the scheme, and for those inside but not covered by the local authority\u2019s partial rollout.\n\nOther lessons include the need for flexible funding to address regional cost differences, the importance of clear communication about the offer (including its interaction with UK tax\u2011free childcare), and the recognition that quality must be safeguarded through registered, inspected providers rather than informal care.\u202fOverall, the pilots underscore that a centrally managed eligibility system, ongoing monitoring, and tailored regional adjustments are essential before a nationwide rollout.",
    "The Project\u202fManager repeatedly stressed that, for the current programme, speech\u2011recognition\u2011type technology is simply not viable.  He said the team \u201cdecided not to go for speech\u2011recognition technologies because of some reasons\u201d and later reiterated that the feature would be \u201cover\u2011the\u2011top\u201d and \u201cnot mature enough to use as a speech\u2011recognition engine.\u201d  He pointed out the practical problems \u2013 background TV noise, the need for a microphone and extra processing power \u2013 and warned that adding it would \u201cblow the price\u201d and jeopardise the \u20ac25 target price.  \n\nWhen the discussion turned to other high\u2011tech options, the Project\u202fManager treated the LCD screen with the same caution.  He noted that an LCD \u201chas already been ruled out\u201d because the unit\u2011cost would exceed the budget ceiling and would require an additional internet connection to feed data.  He concluded that, given the cost constraints, \u201cit is impossible\u201d to fit an LCD at the \u20ac25 price point and that the design should therefore rely on a very basic visual cue rather than a full\u2011colour display.  \n\nOn button design the manager favoured a minimalist, ergonomic approach.  He said the remote should have \u201conly a few buttons\u201d \u2013 the essential power, channel\u2011up/down and volume controls \u2013 and that \u201cthe remote control is still fairly basic, just a few buttons.\u201d  He supported the idea of a scroll\u2011wheel for channel and volume changes, but warned against \u201ctoo many buttons\u201d which would increase complexity and cost.  He also backed the use of rubber\u2011covered, durable buttons and the possibility of interchangeable covers, but insisted that any extra features (extra buttons, LCD, speech\u2011recognition) must stay within the strict cost envelope.  In short, the Project\u202fManager wants a simple, cheap, button\u2011centric remote with only optional, low\u2011cost tech enhancements.",
    "The group spent a large part of the meeting sorting out how the corpus should be recorded and what, if any, video should be added.  \n\n**Recording conventions**  \n*\u202fMicrophone uniformity was the first priority.  Everyone agreed that the current mix of lapel, table\u2011top and head\u2011mounted mics makes the signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio highly variable and forces transcribers to \u201cguess\u201d which channel belongs to which speaker.  The consensus was to purchase a half\u2011dozen identical close\u2011talk microphones (the same model that most people already like) and replace the few remaining wired units with wireless equivalents.  The plan is to standardise the placement (about a thumb\u2011width from the mouth, angled to avoid breath noise) and to keep all channels synchronized so that later beam\u2011forming or array processing can be applied without large skew.  A small\u2011scale \u201cfield trip\u201d will be done to test the new mics, after which the order will be placed.  \n\n*\u202fChannel recording was also debated.  The team decided to keep each microphone on a separate channel (up to 16 channels are supported by the current boards) rather than mixing everything into a single track.  This preserves the ability to isolate speakers, to run forced\u2011alignment on clean segments, and to experiment with multi\u2011channel recognisers such as the modified Multi\u2011Trans system.  The only exception would be a post\u2011processing step that collapses the channels into a single file for distribution, but the raw multi\u2011channel data will be retained for research.  \n\n**Video recordings**  \n*\u202fInterest in video was raised when the NIST/ATLAS team mentioned that their instrumented meeting room includes video and a sophisticated array.  The group acknowledged that video would be valuable for multimodal research (e.g., gesture, gaze, speaker\u2011location) and for providing context to the transcripts.  \n\n*\u202fHowever, several obstacles were identified:  \n\u202f\u202f\u2013\u202fHuman\u2011subjects consent forms currently only cover audio; adding video would require new approvals and would raise privacy concerns.  \n\u202f\u202f\u2013\u202fNo one on the team is presently set up to install and maintain a video system, and the effort to integrate video streams with the existing audio pipeline would be substantial.  \n\n*\u202fThe decision was to **defer video capture** for now.  The team will monitor external projects (NIST, ATLAS, other labs) that are already recording video, and if a collaborator offers a ready\u2011made array\u2011camera system and a clear consent protocol, they will consider a pilot.  In the meantime, the focus will remain on improving audio quality, standardising microphone conventions, and ensuring the multi\u2011channel recordings are well\u2011documented and easily shareable.  ",
    "**Project\u2011Finance Discussion**\n\nThe team repeatedly returned to the financial ceiling that frames every design decision. The project manager opened the finance segment by stating that the prototype must meet a strict \u201cfinance criteria\u201d and that any deviation could jeopardize the target selling price of \u20ac25 and the projected \u20ac50\u202fmillion profit. Throughout the meeting the group identified several cost\u2011driving items\u2014most notably the sample speaker, the scroll\u2011wheel mechanism, and the elaborate colour/lighting options. By stripping the speaker down to a simple beep, eliminating the scroll\u2011wheel (or replacing it with two push\u2011buttons), and simplifying the colour scheme, the team believed they could stay comfortably under budget. They also floated \u201coff\u2011shoring\u201d production to a lower\u2011cost country as a way to shave further expenses. Minor finance issues were acknowledged, but the consensus was that the remaining features (rubber housing, LCD display, basic push\u2011buttons, and a locator dot) would fit within the allocated budget while still delivering a marketable product.\n\n**Use of the Drawing Board (Whiteboard)\u202f**\n\nThe meeting placed heavy emphasis on the drawing board as a collaborative design tool. Early on the facilitator highlighted the whiteboard\u2019s role in \u201ctraining\u201d the team to capture ideas in real time, contrasting it with static PowerPoint slides that cannot be edited on the fly. Participants used the board to sketch the remote\u2019s shape, experiment with curvy versus angular forms, and even draw unrelated animals (spider, panther, elephant) to practice rapid visual communication. The board also served as a \u201cscratchpad\u201d for layout of button groups, scroll\u2011wheel placement, and colour palettes, allowing instant feedback and quick iteration. Later, a comment about saving the drawing and editing it later with a mouse underscored the desire to keep the board\u2019s output digital for further refinement. Overall, the drawing board was treated as an essential, flexible medium for brainstorming, problem\u2011solving, and aligning the team\u2019s visual language before committing to detailed CAD work.",
    "**Industrial Designer\u2019s view**  \nThroughout the discussions the Industrial Designer repeatedly stressed the tension between aesthetic ambition and cost reality. He liked the idea of a \u201cspongy\u2011rubber\u201d feel, distinct button colours and a curved\u2011single\u2011profile shell, but recognised that the rubber case, special\u2011colour buttons and the voice\u2011recognition module were driving the bill of materials above the target. He therefore advocated moving to a plain plastic housing, dropping the extra colour treatments, keeping only one \u201cspecial\u201d button (the red\u2011apple) and simplifying the button layout (fewer numeric keys, more menu\u2011driven navigation). He also warned that the kinetic\u2011energy power source and the L\u2011C\u2011D screen added innovation points but also cost points, so a trade\u2011off was needed. Overall his stance was: preserve a sleek, recognisable look for the Real Reaction brand while pruning the features that make the prototype too expensive.\n\n**Project Manager\u2019s view**  \nThe Project Manager kept the financial envelope front\u2011and\u2011centre. He reminded the team that the remote must sell for \u20ac25 and stay under a production cost of \u20ac12.5, yet the current prototype scored 13.7 points. He pushed for the simplest technical solution\u2014infra\u2011red signalling, standard tiny batteries and a single\u2011curve plastic case\u2014because those choices automatically shave the required 1.2\u2011point excess. He also stressed the need for a clear corporate identity (logo placement, colour scheme) and for the prototype to be evaluated against the agreed criteria (fancy\u2011look, technical innovation, ease of use).  \n\n**Conclusions drawn from the presentations**  \nAfter reviewing the prototype presentations the Project Manager concluded that the design was too costly and over\u2011engineered. To meet the budget he decided to: (1) switch the housing to plastic, (2) eliminate the extra colour treatments and most special\u2011form buttons, (3) retain only the core functional set (infra\u2011red, basic button set, optional kinetic power if cost permits), and (4) drop or defer the speech\u2011recognition feature. He also noted that the team\u2019s collaboration had improved, but further meetings would be required to finalise the financial model and confirm the reduced\u2011feature design before moving to production.",
    "The team approached the \u201cbase\u201d question as a structured decision\u2011making exercise rather than an off\u2011the\u2011cuff opinion. First they listed the two architectural options: a **stand\u2011alone remote with replaceable batteries** versus a **rechargeable unit that rests on a docking base**. Each option was scored against three pre\u2011agreed criteria\u2014ease of use, fashionability, and technological innovation\u2014using a seven\u2011point scale. The scores were then tallied in a quick vote, and the group agreed to move forward with a **rechargeable remote plus a low\u2011profile charging stand** because it scored higher on innovation (it allowed a built\u2011in locator and optional voice\u2011trigger) and on ergonomics (the stand gave the remote a solid, \u201csteady\u201d footprint without making the hand\u2011held part too bulky).\n\nFashionability was judged through market\u2011trend data (fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable prints, spongy textures, bright\u2011yellow accents) and through internal preference polls. The team concluded that a **minimalist, gun\u2011metal\u2011gray plastic shell with a removable, soft\u2011latex \u201cfruit\u2011inspired\u201d overlay** would satisfy the trend without turning the product into a gimmick. They rejected full\u2011fruit\u2011shaped casings because they feared the design would look childish and could limit brand consistency.\n\nWhen reviewing existing remotes, the group identified several pros and cons. **Pros** of current models included reliable hard\u2011click buttons, familiar rectangular layouts, and low cost. **Cons** were the lack of tactile differentiation for blind use, over\u2011crowded button arrays, outdated LCD screens that added cost without clear benefit, and the absence of any charging base or locator feature. These observations reinforced the decision to adopt a softer, larger\u2011button interface, side\u2011scroll wheels, and a rechargeable base as differentiators that address both usability gaps and the fashion\u2011forward image the team wants to project.",
    "The team\u2019s conversation covered a broad set of design considerations for the new remote\u2011control concept:\n\n**Environmental\u2011friendly material** \u2013 Several members raised the idea of using \u201csmart\u201d or shape\u2011memory alloys that could be heated to separate components at end\u2011of\u2011life, making recycling easier. A kinetic or kinetic\u2011dynamo battery was also discussed as a low\u2011impact power source, though its cost and reliability remain uncertain.\n\n**Current trend** \u2013 Market research indicated a shift from purely functional devices to \u201cfancy\u2011look\u2011and\u2011feel\u201d products. Young consumers especially favor bright primary colours, fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable motifs, and tactile, spongy textures. The trend is to blend fashion with technology, rather than focus solely on functionality.\n\n**Potential materials** \u2013 Options mentioned included hard plastic for the main shell, a titanium or titanium\u2011coated back for a premium, metallic look, and a soft, rubber\u2011like (latex or stress\u2011ball) outer layer to provide a spongy grip. Wood and other traditional materials were noted for older, wealthier users, but were deemed less suitable for the target youthful market.\n\n**LCD screen** \u2013 An LCD display was seen as a desirable \u201cwow\u201d feature, allowing menu navigation and on\u2011screen information (channel titles, contrast settings). However, the screen would require an advanced chip, raising cost and complexity. Some participants argued the screen might be unnecessary if the menu could be shown on the TV instead.\n\n**Colour** \u2013 Primary, fruit\u2011inspired colours (lemon yellow, strawberry red, blueberry blue) were proposed for both the case and the optional interchangeable covers. The colour scheme should reinforce the playful, fashionable image while remaining affordable.\n\n**Spongy material** \u2013 The spongy, latex\u2011type coating was praised for comfort and grip, especially for long\u2011term use. Concerns were raised about protecting internal electronics, but a thin latex skin over a hard plastic core was suggested as a compromise.\n\n**Material\u2011function issue** \u2013 The team struggled to reconcile a strong, premium look (metallic titanium) with a soft, ergonomic feel (spongy latex). Consensus leaned toward a hard\u2011plastic front for durability and a softer, possibly titanium\u2011back or latex\u2011covered back for tactile appeal.\n\n**Questionnaire** \u2013 A user questionnaire was referenced to validate preferences: respondents favored fancy aesthetics over pure functionality, liked bright colours, and were willing to pay extra for a stylish remote. Voice\u2011recognition was popular but deemed costly; the LCD screen was viewed as more valuable than speech control. The questionnaire data helped prioritize colour, material, and feature decisions.",
    "**Introduction of the prototype**  \nThe Project Manager opened the design review by reminding the team of the strict \u20ac12.50 unit\u2011cost ceiling imposed by senior management. He presented the first physical mock\u2011up \u2013 a \u201csurf\u2011board\u201d\u2011shaped remote with a conventional button layout, an LCD status display, a small LED battery\u2011indicator, and an integrated microphone for speech\u2011recognition. He stressed that the special shape was the only non\u2011standard element; all other components (infrared transmitter, power button, volume and channel keys) followed familiar TV\u2011remote conventions and would cost roughly \u20ac8 to produce.  \n\nThe User\u2011Interface lead elaborated on the functional layout: six physical keys that double\u2011up to provide twelve logical functions, a toggle\u2011switch to change between TV and VCR modes, an LCD that can show the current device, and a blinking LED that also serves as a locator when the battery is low. He noted that the remote could be covered with a removable plastic sleeve, which would protect the LCD when not in use.  \n\nThe Industrial Designer reinforced the ergonomic intent of the surf\u2011board silhouette, arguing that its smooth, rubber\u2011coated surface would feel \u201cspongy\u201d in the hand and reduce strain. He down\u2011played colour concerns, suggesting that the shape alone would convey the product\u2019s modern identity.\n\n**Multi\u2011functional vs. single\u2011functional views**  \nThe group repeatedly cited user\u2011survey data showing that 90\u202f% of users employ only ten percent of the available buttons. Consequently, most participants favoured a single\u2011function remote (TV only) because it is easier to learn, cheaper to build and aligns with the \u201cminimal\u2011button\u201d preference. A few argued that a multifunctional device could add value, but they warned that the extra circuitry and extra keys would push the bill of materials beyond the budget and increase the risk of a cluttered user experience.\n\n**Why the technological aspect received low grades**  \nWhen the evaluation was run, the prototype was scored low on technology for three reasons: (1) it offered no genuine innovation beyond a standard LCD and LED\u2014features already common in competing products; (2) the optional speech\u2011recognition module required an advanced chip that would raise costs and was deemed unreliable in a noisy living\u2011room environment; (3) the overall architecture relied on a basic infrared transmitter, lacking any novel connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi\u2011Fi) that the brief had hinted at. These shortcomings led the team to assign a \u201c2\u20113\u201d out of five for the technological criterion.\n\n**Locator consideration in functional requirements**  \nDuring the functional\u2011requirements discussion, the team debated a \u201clocator\u201d feature. The UI suggested using the battery\u2011low LED as a visual cue, while the Industrial Designer proposed a dedicated \u201cbeeper\u201d button on the TV that would trigger an audible tone on the remote. Both ideas were acknowledged as valuable for preventing loss of the device, but the Project Manager noted that implementing a separate locator circuit would consume a significant portion of the \u20ac12.50 budget, and the team ultimately agreed to keep only the LED indicator for now, revisiting a more robust locator only if cost permits.",
    "PhD\u202fA and PhD\u202fC came to a clear, if tentative, consensus on three points that have been holding up the overlap\u2011analysis work.\n\n**Variance (and the log\u2011energy normalisation).**  \nBoth agreed that the current practice of subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance in the log\u2011energy domain is probably not optimal.  The log transform compresses the dynamic range, so the resulting \u201cnormalised\u201d values tend to hide the very changes they are trying to detect.  PhD\u202fC noted that the HTK training loop already uses a mixture of Gaussians, and that the variance parameter in those Gaussians is only a crude proxy for the true spread of the data.  PhD\u202fA echoed this, suggesting that a simple PDF (or at least a non\u2011Gaussian model) would be safer than assuming a normal distribution for the log\u2011energy values.\n\n**The discussion with Jos\u00e9.**  \nJos\u00e9 was brought into the conversation to probe the same issue from a signal\u2011processing angle.  He proposed two concrete experiments: (1) vary the analysis window length (instead of the fixed 200\u202fms) and try moving\u2011window statistics, and (2) avoid the log\u2011energy domain altogether and work with raw or linear\u2011energy measures before normalising.  Jos\u00e9 also warned that the log\u2011energy subtraction may be \u201cdiminishing the effect of having two speakers\u201d because log\u2011additions turn multiplicative increases into additive ones that are numerically small.\n\n**Problems caused by overlaps.**  \nAll three participants recognised that overlapping speech makes the feature distributions heavily overlap, so the separation that a simple variance\u2011normalised log\u2011energy would provide disappears.  Back\u2011channel overlaps are especially deceptive: they often do not raise the energy noticeably, yet they still create a second speech source that contaminates the statistics.  Because the distributions of single\u2011speaker and overlapped frames are not cleanly separable, any normalisation that assumes a single Gaussian shape will be misleading.  Consequently they agreed that a more flexible model (e.g., PDFs that can capture multimodality, or window\u2011specific normalisation) and a systematic test of window length are needed before variance\u2011based normalisation can be trusted in the presence of overlaps.",
    "The group spent a substantial part of the meeting examining the extra latency introduced by the new mean\u2011subtraction / smoothing step that is being added to the SmartKom front\u2011end.  In the current design the mean of the spectral magnitudes is not taken from the immediately\u2011preceding frames but from a recursive estimate that looks ahead a few frames (the \u201cfuture\u201d estimate).  This recursion creates a delay of roughly fifty frames, which at the 10\u202fms frame\u2011rate used in the system corresponds to about **0.5\u202fseconds (\u2248\u202f500\u202fms)** of processing lag.  In addition, the overall pipeline already buffers a 24\u2011frame super\u2011frame (\u2248\u202f240\u202fms) and the TCP transport adds another variable buffer, so the total end\u2011to\u2011end latency can easily exceed **200\u202fms**.\n\nProfessor\u202fC\u2019s objection stems from the interactive nature of SmartKom: users expect a near\u2011real\u2011time response, and any latency above a few hundred milliseconds degrades the conversational feel and may force the system to \u201ccut the latency in half\u201d later, which would be a major redesign effort.  He warns that if the latency is ignored now, the team could end up \u201cin a bind\u201d when a stricter latency budget is imposed, so he urges a conservative approach and suggests exploring ways to use only past frames or to reduce the recursion depth.\n\nIn summary, the latency discussion highlighted a **\u2248\u202f0.5\u202fs delay** from the recursive mean estimate, an **overall system latency of 200\u2013500\u202fms**, and the professor\u2019s concern that this exceeds the acceptable interactive\u2011system budget, potentially jeopardizing the user experience and requiring costly redesigns.",
    "The User\u2011Interface team presented a **fully\u2011specified, ergonomically\u2011focused prototype** that combines a tactile, customizable hardware design with several \u201csmart\u201d functions.  \n\n**Key features introduced**\n\n1. **Ergonomic wooden case** \u2013 a hand\u2011friendly, biomorphic shape made from stained, custom\u2011colour wood. The case can be personalized on both the front flip\u2011panel and the back, allowing users to choose their own backing material or finish.  \n2. **Flip\u2011panel with integrated LCD** \u2013 a yellow LCD screen is revealed when the panel is lifted, providing visual feedback for menu, channel and volume status. The LCD can be omitted if cost becomes prohibitive.  \n3. **Large, hard\u2011to\u2011miss on/off button** \u2013 positioned centrally for instant access, complemented by a dark\u2011blue numeric pad, right\u2011hand menu button, left\u2011hand voice\u2011recognition toggle, and a dedicated mute button set.  \n4. **Voice\u2011recognition system** \u2013 a microphone placed on the side (not under the flip) so it remains active even when the remote is closed, enabling hands\u2011free operation when the user is occupied (e.g., holding a drink or popcorn).  \n5. **Customizable backing and modular circuit board** \u2013 the internal layout can be adjusted to accommodate additional features such as a rechargeable battery, simple chip\u2011on\u2011print electronics, and optional sensors.  \n6. **Button design** \u2013 soft\u2011rubber, egg\u2011shaped push\u2011buttons with clear symbols and numbers for international use; a fluorescent\u2011green LED\u2011menu button controls colour, contrast and brightness.  \n7. **Accessory holder** \u2013 an \u201coyster\u2011shaped\u201d cradle that keeps the remote stable when not in use.  \n\n**Advantages highlighted**\n\n- **User comfort and control** \u2013 the weighty, rounded case gives a premium feel while still being light enough for easy handling; all functions are reachable with a single thumb.  \n- **Customization** \u2013 wood staining, interchangeable backs, and side\u2011mounted mic give customers a personalizable product without redesigning the core hardware.  \n- **Reduced reliance on line\u2011of\u2011sight** \u2013 voice control eliminates the need to pick up the remote, a clear benefit when hands are busy.  \n- **Cost flexibility** \u2013 the LCD is optional, and the simple chip\u2011on\u2011print design keeps component costs low, keeping the unit under the \u20ac12.5 budget ceiling.  \n- **International usability** \u2013 symbols on every button remove language barriers, supporting a global market launch.  \n\nTogether, these UI\u2011driven design choices create a remote that is tactile, adaptable, and technologically forward while staying within budget constraints.",
    "**Presentation**  \nThe design team unveiled a \u201cfruit\u2011inspired\u201d remote\u2011control prototype. Visually it is a stylised banana: a double\u2011curved, ergonomic shell with a titanium\u2011coloured front and back, a spongy\u2011rubber texture for a soft hand\u2011feel, and a bright yellow (or optional colour\u2011coded) finish that makes it instantly eye\u2011catching. The functional layout consists of two thumb\u2011operated scroll wheels \u2013 one for volume, one for channel \u2013 and a centrally placed \u201cturbo\u201d button that lets the user fast\u2011scroll through stations. A small LCD panel can be fitted on the upper side to show channel numbers or menu items, and a microphone/speaker array is positioned on the side for an optional speech\u2011recognition add\u2011on. Power is supplied by a single rechargeable cell (or optional AA\u2019s) and a base\u2011station provides charging and a locator beacon.\n\n**Discussion**  \nThe group debated ergonomics (right\u2011 vs left\u2011handed use, thickness, and whether the banana shape would be comfortable), material choice (titanium versus high\u2011impact plastic), and cost constraints (target retail \u20ac12.5, production cost \u2248\u202f\u20ac4\u20135 for the basic unit). The LCD and speech\u2011recognition features were praised for innovation but deemed too expensive for the first launch. The \u201cturbo\u201d button, scroll wheels and the locator function were unanimously accepted as valuable. Concerns were raised about durability of the spongy shell, battery life, and the need for modularity to cater to different user groups (children, seniors, tech\u2011savvy users).\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe team agreed to proceed with two concrete versions of the prototype:  \n\n1. **Full\u2011feature version** \u2013 includes the LCD screen, speech\u2011recognition module and optional colour\u2011coded skins; this will be a premium offering but exceeds the \u20ac12.5 price ceiling.  \n2. **Core version** \u2013 retains the double\u2011curved titanium\u2011coloured shell, two scroll wheels, turbo button and locator beacon, but omits the LCD and speech\u2011recognition to stay within budget.  \n\nBoth versions will use the same ergonomic, spongy\u2011feel material and modular architecture, allowing future upgrades (e.g., add\u2011on modules for parental control or larger buttons). The next step is to build the core prototype, run a cost analysis, and then evaluate market response before finalising production.",
    "The team\u2019s debate centered on how far they could push \u201cpremium\u201d features without breaching the \u20ac12\u2011\u20ac13 per\u2011unit cost ceiling that the budget imposes.\n\n**Touch\u2011screen** \u2013 The screen was praised as the most marketable differentiator, but the engineering estimate placed its cost at roughly \u20ac17.50 per remote, which would force a retail price of \u20ac25\u2011\u20ac30 to keep a 50\u202f% margin. Because the current supplier does not offer a low\u2011cost LCD\u2011touch module, several members argued that the touch\u2011screen should be shelved for a later generation. The consensus was to retain the idea as a future upgrade and focus now on the functions already in\u2011house (voice\u2011recognition and a simple LCD indicator).\n\n**Flip\u2011screen / flip\u2011top** \u2013 A hinged \u201cflip\u2011open\u201d panel was suggested to protect the buttons from accidental presses (especially by children) and to hide secondary controls. The flip\u2011top would also provide a small display for channel\u2011or\u2011menu feedback. However, participants flagged two drawbacks: the extra mechanism adds weight and complexity, and the cost of a durable hinge plus a miniature LCD would again push the unit price above the target. The group therefore agreed to keep the flip\u2011top concept only if a low\u2011cost LCD can be sourced; otherwise the remote will remain a single\u2011face design with the most\u2011used buttons on the front and the less\u2011used functions accessed via a simple menu button.\n\n**Battery issues** \u2013 The existing AAA cells are bulky and drive the remote\u2019s thickness. Lithium\u2011ion or rechargeable packs would reduce size but are not supplied by the current manufacturer, meaning a new supplier would be required and tooling costs would rise. Solar cells were floated as an \u201ceco\u2011friendly\u201d option, but the team noted that ambient light in many living\u2011room settings is insufficient, so a backup battery would still be needed. The final decision was to stay with AAA cells for the first run, while a parallel study looks at a rechargeable/Li\u2011ion alternative for a future revision.\n\nOverall, the group concluded that, given the budget constraints, the remote should prioritize a simple ergonomic shape, primary power\u2011on/volume/channel buttons, and either voice\u2011recognition or a modest LCD indicator. Flip\u2011top and touch\u2011screen features will be revisited only if cost\u2011effective components become available.",
    "The Government says that the three\u2011year Schools\u202fChallenge\u202fCymru investment has produced a clear set of lessons that are now being embedded in the wider school\u2011improvement agenda.\n\n**Key lessons learned**\n\n1. **Leadership and capacity matter** \u2013 The programme showed that schools with strong, newly appointed headteachers responded most quickly to the support. This reinforced the Government\u2019s focus on building leadership talent across the system.  \n2. **Early, targeted intervention works** \u2013 Evidence that concentrating PDG resources on early years and Key Stage\u202f3 reduces later catch\u2011up spending has been codified in the new guidance that the majority of PDG must be used before Year\u202f10.  \n3. **Evidence\u2011based practice and tracking are essential** \u2013 Early phases of the scheme funded the development of pupil\u2011tracking systems; the Government now requires schools to use robust, evidence\u2011based toolkits (e.g., the Sutton Trust model) and is exploring a Welsh\u2011specific toolkit.  \n4. **Collaborative, regional support is critical** \u2013 The success of the specialist advisers employed by Schools Challenge Cymru demonstrated the value of highly skilled regional staff. Those advisers have been transferred into the four regional consortia, ensuring the expertise is retained and can be offered to all schools, not just the 39 original participants.  \n5. **Flexibility in eligibility and funding** \u2013 The programme highlighted the limitations of using free\u2011school\u2011meal status as the sole proxy for need. The Government is reviewing longer\u2011term PDG allocation models and the possibility of broader eligibility (e.g., for looked\u2011after or adopted pupils).  \n\n**Progress and current status**\n\nThe formal Schools\u202fChallenge\u202fCymru programme has ended, but its legacy is continuing. Schools that received the intensive support are now being monitored through the categorisation system; many have moved from \u201cred\u201d to \u201cgreen\u201d status (e.g., Tredegar, Eastern High). The regional consortia, reinforced with the former challenge advisers, are delivering the same intensity of support via improvement boards, with 25 days of assistance for the most challenged schools\u2014greater than the 20 days previously offered. Monitoring visits by Estyn in 2017 reported that three of the four consortia are making strong progress, and the fourth is being supported to reach the same level.  \n\nOverall, the Government is confident that the lessons from Schools\u202fChallenge\u202fCymru have been captured, the specialist capacity retained, and the improvement model now scaled to reach every school, ensuring sustained progress beyond the original three\u2011year investment.",
    "Dr.\u202fDavid Blaney views the impact of Brexit on Wales\u2019s higher\u2011education system as a mix of short\u2011term disruption and longer\u2011term strategic risk, but he stresses that the sector remains resilient if it can adapt its offering.  \n\nHe notes that the most tangible effect so far is an **8\u202f% fall in EU\u2011domiciled applications to Welsh institutions**, contrasted with a 2\u202f% rise in England. The primary driver, he explains, is the **change in student\u2011support arrangements**: EU students now face full\u2011fee liability and must secure loans, whereas previously they received the same grant as Welsh students. This creates a temporary \u201cperturbation\u201d that could recover once the new funding model stabilises.  \n\nA second, less political factor is the **relative under\u2011investment in Welsh campus facilities**. Over many years Welsh universities have received less capital funding than many English counterparts, leading to older estates and less\u2011modern teaching equipment. Prospective students, especially those from abroad, compare campus quality and perceive English institutions as offering a better student experience.  \n\nDespite these pressures, Dr\u202fBlaney argues that Wales still has compelling reasons for students to choose it. He highlights **safety and a supportive environment**, noting that Wales\u2019s smaller cities are viewed as safer than many English urban centres. Moreover, students receive a **UK\u2011quality degree** within a setting that is often described as more personable and community\u2011oriented. The \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d campaign is intended to amplify these strengths, positioning Wales as a secure, high\u2011value alternative that combines the prestige of a UK qualification with a welcoming, lower\u2011cost living environment.  \n\nIn summary, Dr\u202fBlaney sees Brexit\u2011related funding changes and historic capital shortfalls as the main causes of the EU\u2011student decline, but believes that Wales\u2019s safety, cost\u2011effectiveness and distinct student experience remain strong selling points for future recruitment.",
    "**Domains in the mental\u2011space model**\n\nThe team settled on a three\u2011tier view of mental spaces that mirrors the classic Fauconnier\u2011Turner framework while staying compatible with the Bayesian\u2011net architecture they are building.\n\n| Domain (mental space) | What it contains | Example in the dialogue |\n|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Base space** (the \u201creal\u2011world\u201d model) | Ontological knowledge about objects, agents, locations, and static world facts. | The ontology entry for *Harry*, the building *Zum Ritter*, the property *has\u2011door*. |\n| **Target / constructed spaces** | Situation\u2011specific configurations that are introduced by the utterance.  These include temporal, spatial and epistemic sub\u2011spaces. | *Past* (event before speech time), *Here/Now* (deictic \u201chere\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d), *Hypothetical France* (a counter\u2011factual scenario). |\n| **Discourse\u2011level space** | The evolving context that tracks what has been said, speaker/hearer roles, and the speaker\u2019s attitude. | The \u201cadmission\u2011fee discussed\u201d node, the \u201cspeaker\u2011belief\u201d flag, the \u201cfocus\u201d slot that records which constituent is currently highlighted. |\n\nThe target spaces are not independent; they can be blended (e.g., a past\u2011oriented \u201cin France\u201d space that also carries a speaker\u2011belief sub\u2011space). The model therefore needs a mechanism to keep these domains aligned while allowing them to diverge when the discourse demands.\n\n**Function of the middle layer**\n\nThe middle layer is the set of *hidden* variables that mediate between the observable feature nodes (bottom layer) and the high\u2011level action/intention nodes (top layer). Its role is three\u2011fold:\n\n1. **Abstraction** \u2013 It collapses many low\u2011level cues (e.g., \u201cnice walls\u201d, \u201cnight\u2011time\u201d, \u201cadmission\u2011fee mentioned\u201d) into a compact representation of the interlocutor\u2019s *state*: tourist vs. business, hurried vs. relaxed, entering vs. merely viewing.  \n2. **Plan\u2011recognition** \u2013 By linking cues to abstract plan slots (e.g., *goal\u2011type*, *agent\u2011role*, *temporal horizon*), the middle layer can infer which mental\u2011space construction the speaker is currently operating in (a past\u2011counterfactual, a deictic \u201chere\u201d, etc.).  \n3. **Propagation** \u2013 Once a hidden node is activated, its posterior probability is fed forward to the top layer, influencing the selection of the appropriate construction (directed\u2011motion, passive, etc.) and back\u2011propagating constraints that may prune incompatible base\u2011space bindings.\n\nOperationally, the middle layer is implemented as a set of hidden Bayesian nodes (e.g., *Tourist\u2011Mode*, *Hurry\u2011Level*, *Enter\u2011Intent*). Evidence from the bottom layer updates their distributions; the resulting posteriors then condition the top\u2011layer semantic\u2011specification. In this way the middle layer acts as the \u201cmental\u2011space engine\u201d that continuously builds, blends, and revises the relevant domains as the conversation unfolds.",
    "The professor treated the back\u2011end as a relatively modest, already\u2011working component, but he acknowledged that it had not yet been the focus of any major redesign.  When the group discussed the digit\u2011recognition pipeline he said, \u201cOur back\u2011end is fairly simple but until now the attempts to improve it have failed,\u201d implying that any further work on the back\u2011end would be incremental rather than a wholesale overhaul.\n\nHis comments on data storage were far more detailed.  He stressed that the primary constraint was disk capacity and the interaction with the nightly backup system.  Because the backup process could become a bottleneck, he advocated moving large, rarely\u2011accessed corpora to non\u2011backed\u2011up disks and then archiving a single copy to tape (or a high\u2011density tape robot).  He noted that \u201cdisk is so cheap it\u2019s essentially free,\u201d so the team could afford a two\u2011tier storage model: a fast, backed\u2011up file server for frequently used data and a slower, non\u2011backed\u2011up area for bulk recordings that would be copied once to tape for long\u2011term preservation.\n\nHe also argued that, for acoustic\u2011research purposes, it was worthwhile to keep all microphone channels (including far\u2011field recordings) as long as there was sufficient space, because researchers might need the full multi\u2011channel data for experiments.  In short, the professor viewed the back\u2011end as functionally adequate but unexciting, while emphasizing a pragmatic, tiered approach to data storage that balances disk cost, backup load, and long\u2011term archival reliability.",
    "The committee\u2019s debate painted a stark picture of Canada\u2019s seniors\u2011care crisis. Members repeatedly cited the military\u2019s grim report that more than 80\u202f% of COVID\u201119 deaths occurred in long\u2011term\u2011care homes, describing horrendous conditions\u2014food shortages, unsanitary environments, and inadequate staffing\u2014especially in for\u2011profit facilities. While the government stressed its respect for provincial jurisdiction, opposition MPs demanded a national guarantee, calling for the removal of profit from long\u2011term\u2011care and the extension of Canada Health\u2011Act standards to these homes.\n\nRacism surfaced as a systemic factor aggravating the crisis. Several speakers linked the over\u2011representation of Indigenous and Black seniors in under\u2011funded facilities to broader patterns of discrimination, urging the government to collect race\u2011based data, eliminate racial profiling, and ensure anti\u2011racism policies are embedded in long\u2011term\u2011care oversight.\n\nIn response to growing concerns about worker and pensioner vulnerability, the government announced amendments to bankruptcy and insolvency law, strengthening protections for severance, termination pay, and pension benefits. These changes aim to prevent corporate bankruptcies from eroding hard\u2011earned retirement security.\n\nHon. Lawrence\u202fMacAulay emphasized that the public debate on veterans\u2019 policies must remain open and inclusive. He noted that the government has allocated roughly $90\u202fmillion in supplementary funding to address the Veterans Affairs backlog and encouraged veterans and families to engage actively in shaping compensation and support programs.\n\nFinally, the Minister of Seniors highlighted pandemic assistance: a one\u2011time, tax\u2011free payment of $300 for OAS recipients and $200 for GIS recipients, expanded GST\u2011credit top\u2011ups, and new community\u2011based projects under the \u201cNew Horizons for Seniors\u201d initiative. While acknowledging the assistance as modest, the minister pledged to accelerate further measures to protect seniors\u2019 health, financial security, and social inclusion.",
    "The three participants kept bumping into each other because each was defending a different set of project constraints.\n\n* **Project\u2011manager (PM)** was the budget\u2011and\u2011schedule guardian.  He repeatedly reminded the group that the remote must sell for about \u20ac25, generate a 50\u202f% margin and reach market in the shortest possible window.  For that reason he pushed for a **single\u2011curved, simple\u2011plastic case, a minimal button set, a basic infrared chip and a wired or cheap battery solution**.  Anything that added cost, required new tooling or delayed the launch \u2013 such as a double\u2011curved shape, kinetic charging, an LCD screen, voice control or a removable\u2011cover system \u2013 was flagged as a risk.\n\n* **Marketing** was focused on differentiation and consumer appeal.  Their research showed that users find current remotes \u201cugly\u201d and would pay more for a **stylish, colourful, customizable product**.  They argued for **bright fruit\u2011colour palettes, removable front plates, LED\u2011lit or LCD buttons, wireless operation and a parental\u2011control feature** that would let parents lock channels.  They saw these as the selling points that could command a premium price and generate buzz, even if it meant a higher bill\u2011of\u2011materials.\n\n* **Industrial Designer** cared about ergonomics, durability and technical feasibility.  He championed a **double\u2011curved, rubberised shell that fits the hand, concave or tactile\u2011feedback buttons and a kinetic\u2011charging option** to make the remote feel high\u2011tech.  He warned that a double\u2011curve, rubber material, wireless module and kinetic generator would increase tooling complexity, risk reliability issues and push the unit price beyond the target.\n\nThe disagreement therefore arose from a classic trade\u2011off: **PM\u2019s cost\u2011and\u2011time constraints vs. Marketing\u2019s desire for eye\u2011catching, feature\u2011rich differentiation vs. Industrial Designer\u2019s ergonomic and technical realism**.  Each insisted that their priority\u2014price, marketability, or usability\u2014must dominate, leading to repeated clashes over parental control, shape, colour, front\u2011panel design, wireless power, the underlying electronics and overall style.",
    "Marketing structured the product evaluation as a simple, group\u2011rated scoring exercise.\u202fFirst the team compiled a short list of the attributes they believed would drive sales, then each attribute was rated on a common scale (the minutes mention a 1\u2011to\u20117 scale, later a 1\u2011to\u201110 average) and the scores were averaged to produce an overall rating for each design concept.\n\nThe concrete criteria that Marketing brought forward were:\n\n1. **Look\u202f&\u202fFeel** \u2013 visual appeal, ergonomics, colour, material finish and overall \u201cfanciness.\u201d  \n2. **Innovation** \u2013 presence of new or differentiating functions (e.g., LCD screen, docking station, speech\u2011recognition, kinetic power, LED indicators).  \n3. **Ease of Use** \u2013 learnability, simplicity of the button layout, intuitiveness for novice users and for older demographics.  \n4. **Target Demographic Appeal** \u2013 how well the design matches the intended age group (20\u201140\u202fyear\u2011olds, \u201cyoung\u201d market, or grandparents) and whether it meets their preferences.  \n5. **Fashion/Trend Alignment** \u2013 adherence to current fashion trends (fruit\u2011/vegetable\u2011themed colours, interchangeable covers, \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d).  \n6. **Company Identity** \u2013 inclusion of the corporate logo, colour scheme and overall brand recognisability.  \n7. **Cost/Price Feasibility** \u2013 staying within the \u20ac12.50 production budget while delivering a product that can be sold at the target retail price (\u20ac25).  \n\nThe evaluation process therefore combined subjective ratings on these seven dimensions, summed them, and used the average as the final score to decide which prototype best satisfied the marketing strategy and budget constraints.",
    "**Current status**\n\n* **Recordings** \u2013 The corpus now contains roughly\u202f30\u201335\u202fhours of multichannel audio (including the original\u202f45\u2011minute \u201ccore\u201d segment, the digit\u2011collection sessions and a growing set of regular meetings).  The raw files are all on\u2011line and have been checked for basic integrity (battery status, channel balance, spike\u2011artifact monitoring).  No additional recordings are pending for the current set; the plan is to keep adding a few more meetings each week so that the total will eventually exceed\u202f50\u202fhours.\n\n* **Transcriptions** \u2013 About\u202f11\u202fhours of the material have been fully transcribed, spell\u2011checked and \u201ccleaned\u201d (consistent handling of numbers, acronyms, non\u2011speech events, etc.).  An additional\u202f\u2248\u202f20\u202fhours have been segmented and are in the final\u2011pass stage (boundary refinement, speaker\u2011overlap markup).  The remaining\u202f\u2248\u202f10\u202fhours are still awaiting the first transcription pass; the team expects to have the whole set ready for release by the end of the semester.\n\n* **Intermediate categories & the SPG schema** \u2013 The Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal (SPG) action framework has been formalised and is being used to label high\u2011level tasks (Enter, View, Approach).  However, the schema is **not yet enforced** by the system: an SPG action can appear without a corresponding SPG schema, and forced\u2011motion or forced\u2011action schemas can coexist with SPG actions.  The developers have explicitly noted that there is \u201cabsolutely no means of enforcing\u201d the linkage, so the current data may contain SPG actions that lack a complete SPG description.  Work on richer intermediate categories (e.g., buying\u2011snack, bakery\u2011visit) is ongoing, but they remain **prototype\u2011level** and are not yet integrated into the XML messages that pass between modules.\n\nIn short, the audio collection is complete and expanding, transcription is roughly one\u2011third finished with the rest in progress, and the SPG schema is defined but still only loosely applied\u2014intermediate categories and strict schema enforcement are future development items.",
    "The Deputy Minister treated each set of amendments as a distinct policy package and used the same \u201cmove\u2011and\u2011explain\u201d formula throughout the Stage\u202f2 debate.\n\n**Group\u202f1 \u2013 Duty to promote public awareness**  \nShe moved the Government\u2011drafted amendments\u202f1 and\u202f4, which place a statutory duty on Welsh Ministers to run a high\u2011intensity, six\u2011year public\u2011awareness campaign about the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. In her remarks she stressed that the duty already covers the need for a comprehensive, well\u2011planned campaign and that the details of target groups, specific messages or the inclusion of visitors to Wales are better dealt with by the implementation and expert\u2011stakeholder groups, not on the face of the Bill. Consequently she asked Members to reject amendments\u202f1A\u20111E, arguing that they would add unnecessary specificity, duplicate existing duties and risk over\u2011legislating on matters that can be managed through guidance and programme design.\n\n**Group\u202f2 \u2013 Duty to report on the effect of the legislation**  \nShe moved amendment\u202f2, which creates a statutory post\u2011implementation review. She outlined a multi\u2011layered monitoring framework \u2013 baseline surveys, regular attitudinal polling, and a dedicated task\u2011and\u2011finish group to collect and analyse data. While welcoming the Committee\u2019s interest in timing and content, she declined to adopt the detailed reporting amendments (2A,\u202f2C,\u202f2E\u20112K), insisting that the Government\u2019s existing review mechanisms already satisfy the Committee\u2019s concerns. She offered to lay interim reports and to consult on the scope of those reports, but resisted any statutory requirement that would lock the Assembly into a fixed reporting schedule or prescribe specific data points.\n\n**Group\u202f3 \u2013 Regulation\u2011making powers**  \nShe moved amendment\u202f3 to restore the limited commencement power that had been removed by earlier amendments, arguing that the Bill only needs the technical transitory, transitional and saving provisions already proposed. She rejected any broader regulatory\u2011making powers, saying they are unnecessary for implementing the awareness campaign or the post\u2011implementation review, but pledged to keep the issue under review for Stage\u202f3 should the Assembly identify a need for additional powers.\n\nAcross all three groups the Deputy Minister consistently accepted the core Government amendments, rejected the Committee\u2011proposed detail\u2011adding amendments, and emphasized that implementation, monitoring and any further powers would be handled through off\u2011Bill mechanisms and future consultation.",
    "The committee heard Minister\u202fKirsty\u202fWilliams describe the long\u2011term picture as one of steady, if uneven, progress in raising standards and improving attainment.  Since the 2013 School Standards Act, the Welsh Government has moved from a data\u2011driven quartile system to a more nuanced categorisation that incorporates professional judgement, and it has introduced a national evaluation and improvement resource to embed robust self\u2011evaluation across schools, local authorities and the Government.  Investment has been heavily weighted toward professional learning \u2013 about half of the \u00a3100\u202fmillion school\u2011improvement fund is spent on teacher development \u2013 and the Minister highlighted gains in primary\u2011school \u201cgreen\u201d ratings, while acknowledging that secondary schools still lag, especially for pupils on free\u2011school\u2011meal and minority\u2011ethnic backgrounds.  The OECD review, due in March, is expected to provide an external benchmark and to test whether the current trajectory is sufficient to meet the \u201cnational mission\u201d targets for reading, maths and higher\u2011level skills.\n\nPhilip\u202fBlaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, explained that his body regulates awarding organisations, approves qualification design and sets the methodology for grade\u2011setting.  The regulator\u2019s core task is to ensure that qualifications are fair and comparable, using \u201ccomparable outcomes\u201d methodology when specifications change, and to monitor the timetabling of reforms so that the system is not forced into rushed roll\u2011outs.  He stressed that future qualification timetables must allow enough lead\u2011time for curriculum development, translation and resource production, and that the regulator will work with the Welsh Government and the OECD to refine these schedules.\n\nOn the immediate exam gap, the Minister confirmed that the cancellation of summer exams will be managed through an interim grading framework that will operate for the next three years, with the OECD report feeding into its evaluation.  The government intends to keep the normal August results timetable where possible, but acknowledges that the extraordinary circumstances may require flexibility.  Longer\u2011term, the Minister and officials signalled a willingness to adjust the categorisation system and to introduce a more strategic, multi\u2011agency approach to school improvement, ensuring that any future exam reforms are given realistic, multi\u2011year timescales to avoid repeat \u201ctsunami\u201d pressures.",
    "The Committee heard that \u201cgood practice\u201d in Welsh education is still fragmented and that the uneven rollout of reforms is limiting its impact across the nation. \u202fKey speakers stressed that the foundation\u2011phase curriculum, self\u2011evaluation tools and the national improvement resource have not been adopted uniformly; some schools and local authorities lack the expertise, data\u2011systems or confidence to apply the new standards, and regional consortia operate with differing models and levels of support. \u202fConsequently, many authorities are reluctant to intervene early in schools that are slipping, fearing they do not have the right tools or sufficient capacity to do so. \u202fThe Minister and officials highlighted a new multi\u2011agency panel and a more sophisticated risk\u2011based categorisation system as attempts to overcome these gaps, but they acknowledged that the system is still evolving and that consistency across the 22 local authorities remains a work\u2011in\u2011progress.\n\nThese education\u2011system challenges map directly onto the early\u2011years and childcare agenda. \u202fChildcare provision varies dramatically by geography, with some areas already offering generous provision while others rely on informal family care. \u202fThe pilot\u2011area rollout of the \u00a34.50\u2011per\u2011hour offer revealed a heavy administrative burden for local authorities, a shortage of qualified staff, and the risk that providers could add extra charges that would erode affordability for low\u2011income families. \u202fThe lack of a single, coordinated data set makes it difficult to track whether Welsh\u2011medium or special\u2011needs provision is being met, and the current funding model does not guarantee that the quality of care will keep pace with the quantity of places. \u202fOverall, the discussion concluded that without a more coherent, well\u2011resourced, and consistently evaluated system\u2014both for schools and for childcare\u2014good practice will continue to be uneven, and the most disadvantaged children risk being left behind.",
    "The team reviewed the parts that are actually on hand and the constraints they impose on the remote\u2019s case and user\u2011interface design.\n\n**Component availability**\n* **Chipset** \u2013 The standard TA\u20111835 IR transmitter is in stock and will be used for all models.\n* **Power source** \u2013 Conventional AA/AAA cells are available, but the design team prefers a smaller watch\u2011type cell paired with kinetic (watch\u2011style) charging. Solar cells were considered but rejected because the panels are large, expensive and fragile for a handheld remote. A dual\u2011power option (kinetic\u202f+\u202freplaceable AA/AAA) was mentioned as a fallback.\n* **Printed circuit board** \u2013 Silicone\u2011based PCBs can be fabricated in any size; the layout can be adjusted to fit a flip\u2011top housing, with separate top and bottom boards linked by wiring.\n* **Display** \u2013 A monochrome LCD panel is available and fits the thin\u2011profile requirement; it cannot be curved, so it will sit flat inside the flip shell.\n* **Buttons** \u2013 Rubberised, anti\u2011RSI \u201cstress\u2011ball\u201d style buttons are stocked and provide the spongy feel the market research calls for. Conventional tactile buttons remain an option for the frequently\u2011used volume/channel controls.\n\n**Case material**\n* The factory can supply injection\u2011moulded plastic for the main shell; this material allows the curved, non\u2011standard shape the team wants.\n* A removable rubber sleeve (or \u201ccover\u201d) can be over\u2011moulded onto the plastic, giving the desired spongy texture and enabling interchangeable colour skins (fruit\u2011 and vegetable\u2011inspired palettes). Titanium or wood were dismissed as either too costly or impractical for mass production.\n* The design will be a flip\u2011top \u201cshell\u201d with the LCD on the upper half and rubberised buttons on the lower half, both fitting comfortably in the palm.\n\n**Interface design**\n* The top half will host the LCD with a simple graphic\u2011user\u2011interface (icons for channel, volume, etc.). The bottom half will use the rubber buttons for the most common functions.\n* Two separate PCB layers will accommodate the LCD circuitry and the button matrix, linked by a small cable.\n* Optional features such as kinetic charging, a locate\u2011beep or voice\u2011prompt were noted but will be deferred pending cost analysis.\n\nIn summary, the available components\u2014TA\u20111835 chip, watch\u2011type kinetic battery, flexible PCBs, monochrome LCD, rubberised buttons, and injection\u2011moulded plastic with removable rubber skins\u2014shape a flip\u2011top remote that meets the desired \u201cfancy, spongy, interchangeable\u201d aesthetic while staying within current stock limits.",
    "The professor emphasized that the team now has a single, unified software package that can be configured in many ways, but the goal is to settle on a concrete \u201cfinal model\u201d rather than keep swapping components.  The current version is only about one\u202fpercent worse than the best proposal they have seen, even though it does not exploit the full \u201cbag of tricks\u201d (e.g., exhaustive over\u2011subtraction, exotic mel\u2011band processing, etc.).  He stressed that the model should be frozen for the next week so that the team can evaluate the impact of any further changes\u2014especially the placement of the neural network (whether it should operate on raw spectra, after Wiener filtering/spectral subtraction, or on the transformed feature set) and the associated latency budget.  The professor noted that causal operation is preferable if standards restrict look\u2011ahead, but a modest future\u2011looking window may improve performance, so the exact latency trade\u2011off must be clarified with the standards group.\n\nOn the time\u2011series side, the discussion turned to modeling reverberation with longer analysis windows and modulation\u2011spectrum techniques.  By extending frames to a few seconds, the reverberation tail can be captured, allowing simple mean\u2011subtraction in the modulation domain to act as a de\u2011reverberation step.  The professor mentioned that factorial HMMs or other time\u2011frequency representations can be used to treat each sub\u2011band as an independent chain, making the overall system more robust to time\u2011varying room responses.\n\nFinally, regarding the pronunciation of the digit \u201c0\u201d, the professor clarified that both \u201czero\u201d and the letter \u201cO\u201d are valid transcriptions.  In the data\u2011collection forms they will write the symbol \u201cOH\u201d and accept either spoken form, noting that most speakers on the phone naturally say \u201czero\u201d.  This standardisation will simplify scoring while preserving natural pronunciation variability.",
    "The team concluded the conceptual design of the new Real\u202fReaction remote with a clear set of trade\u2011offs that balance fashion, cost and functionality.\n\n**Concept & Form\u2011factor** \u2013 A double\u2011curved, rubber\u2011coated case was chosen for its soft\u2011grip feel and \u201cspongy\u201d aesthetic that appeals to younger users while still being acceptable to seniors. The case will be removable and offered in bright, fruit\u2011inspired colour kits so customers can swap covers after purchase. The remote will be sized for one\u2011hand operation and will include a protective inner hard\u2011plastic shell to safeguard the electronics.\n\n**Power source** \u2013 The group favoured a kinetic generator as the primary energy source, with a small rechargeable battery as a backup. Shaking or moving the remote re\u2011charges the internal cell, eliminating the need for frequent battery replacement while keeping component costs low.\n\n**User\u2011interface** \u2013 Push\u2011buttons were selected over a scroll\u2011wheel to keep the hardware simple and the bill of materials inexpensive. A modest LCD panel will be optional; if included it will display menu navigation and channel information, but the core design will rely on a concise on\u2011screen menu accessed through a \u201cMenu\u201d button. No full\u2011screen TV\u2011overlay display was approved because of readability concerns.\n\n**Universal\u2011remote scope** \u2013 The product will support up to three device profiles (TV, set\u2011top box, audio) with a simple profile\u2011switch button, but it will not aim to be a high\u2011end universal remote that covers dozens of appliances. This limits chipset complexity and keeps the target price under \u20ac12.50.\n\n**Parental\u2011control** \u2013 A lightweight login/profile system will be built in. Parents can lock the remote with a short PIN; children will have a \u201cKids\u201d profile that restricts channel ranges or time\u2011of\u2011day access. The feature is considered a core differentiator despite the modest extra software cost.\n\n**Games & Voice Recognition** \u2013 Both were discussed as \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d extras. The team agreed to defer game integration and voice\u2011command functionality to a future generation, citing limited market willingness to pay the added cost and the risk of false triggers in noisy living\u2011room environments.\n\nOverall, the design emphasizes a stylish, kinetic\u2011powered remote with essential multi\u2011device control, integrated parental safeguards, and a simple button\u2011based UI, while postponing advanced features such as games and voice recognition.",
    "The committee heard a wide\u2011ranging evidence session on the impact of COVID\u201119 on children, young people and health services.  Ministers, senior health officials and the Deputy Minister outlined how the Welsh Government is monitoring paediatric capacity, mental\u2011health provision, safeguarding, perinatal services and third\u2011sector support while schools remain closed.\n\nVaughan\u202fGething was asked specifically about two emerging concerns.  Regarding a possible rise in youth suicide, he explained that the Government has commissioned the Delivery Unit, in partnership with the national advisory group chaired by Dr\u202fAnn\u202fJohn, to review all unexpected deaths recorded since the pandemic began.  The review will assess whether lockdown\u2011related stressors have contributed to a spike in self\u2011harm and is expected to be completed by the end of the month, after which the findings will be shared with the committee.  He stressed that crisis\u2011care services for children and young people remain fully operational and that mental\u2011health services are being monitored weekly through a reporting tool that tracks staff sickness, referrals and capacity.\n\nOn long\u2011term special care for pregnant women, Gething described a round\u2011table held with the NSPCC and other partners to map perinatal mental\u2011health support.  He noted that routine antenatal and post\u2011natal services have continued, with an expanded telephone and online advice network to reduce face\u2011to\u2011face contact.  The Government is safeguarding the immunisation programme, maintaining mother\u2011and\u2011baby unit capacity, and working to ensure that any reduction in attendance is due to fear rather than lack of provision.  He affirmed that perinatal services will remain a priority, with ongoing monitoring of capacity and a commitment to protect both physical and mental health of pregnant women throughout the pandemic and beyond.",
    "The Minister confirmed that the strategic\u2011delivery group set up to tidy up the middle\u2011tier and to underpin the new curriculum is now finalising its work.  The group, which was created roughly 18\u202fmonths ago, is \u201ccurrently engaging with officials on agreeing a plan\u201d and the intention is to have that plan in place \u201cas soon as possible\u201d so that the curriculum can be rolled out without further delay.  When asked about the danger of the system \u201closing focus\u201d, the Minister stressed that the group\u2019s remit is explicitly to keep the focus sharp: roles and responsibilities are being codified, there is a clear demarcation of who does what, and the risk of drifting into a \u201cbubble\u201d of self\u2011praise has been acknowledged and guarded against.\n\nOn the question of improvements that are more demanding, the Minister and officials agreed that the old, single\u2011track approach would not move schools that are \u201ccausing concern\u201d.  A new multi\u2011agency panel \u2013 involving the school, the local authority, the regional consortia, Estyn and Welsh Government \u2013 has been introduced to tackle the deeper, structural problems rather than just the \u201clow\u2011hanging fruit\u201d.  They argued that without this tougher, more coordinated effort the system would simply repeat past failures, so a more challenging set of interventions is now being embraced.\n\nThe discussion of PRU networking and transition arrangements centred on the need for tighter links between PRU provision and mainstream schools.  Janet Finch\u2011Saunders highlighted the upcoming PRU in Swansea (opening January\u202f2021) and the \u201cpart\u2011time timetable\u201d that allows pupils to remain attached to their home school while receiving specialist support.  Ministers noted that the transition process is deliberately managed \u2013 support continues after a pupil returns to mainstream, with a gradual reduction of assistance \u2013 and that networking is being strengthened through joint visits, shared professional\u2011learning sessions and a \u201cteam\u2011around\u2011the\u2011family\u201d approach.  The consensus was that better networking and clearly defined transition pathways are essential to prevent pupils from falling through the cracks, especially at Key Stage\u202f4.",
    "When the team turned to the **infra\u2011red (IR) subsystem** they treated it as a non\u2011negotiable core of the remote.  The industrial designer argued that IR is the preferred transmission method because it does not require a line\u2011of\u2011sight and can be made very reliable if the signal is clear and the component quality is high.  The user\u2011interface engineer echoed this, insisting that the IR \u201cmust be functional and reliable\u201d and that the chip\u2011to\u2011IR driver must not be compromised by a weak battery or a noisy design.  Several comments stressed that the IR signal has to be strong enough to work from a normal viewing distance without the user having to \u201cwave the remote around,\u201d and that the whole chain\u2014battery, chip, user\u2011interface, IR LED\u2014must be robust.  In short, the group agreed that a clean, dependable IR link is essential to the remote\u2019s basic function and should be engineered with high\u2011quality parts and sufficient power.\n\nOn the **disposable\u2011income side** the discussion focused on identifying a target market that could afford a premium\u2011styled remote priced around \u20ac25.  Marketing presented data from the usability survey: people aged 15\u201135 tend to have **higher disposable income** because they are less likely to have mortgages, car payments or other large financial commitments.  This age bracket also shows a willingness to pay extra for a \u201cfancier\u201d look and for advanced features such as voice recognition.  The team therefore saw the 15\u201135 demographic as the sweet spot\u2014young enough to value fashion and technology, yet financially able to spend on a slightly upscale remote.  The price ceiling of roughly \u20ac12\u2011\u20ac13 for production was noted, but the group felt that targeting consumers with sufficient disposable income would make the \u20ac25 retail price realistic.",
    "The Committee members agreed that, at present, free\u2011school\u2011meal (FSM) eligibility is the most practical proxy for socioeconomic need, even if it is an imperfect measure.  Kirsty\u202fWilliams acknowledged that \u201cin the absence of anything better, it is probably the best that we\u2019ve got at present\u201d and that the Government is already looking at how universal\u2011credit data might provide a more nuanced eligibility framework.  Nevertheless, the panel stressed that any new definition must respect data\u2011protection rules and should be introduced only after a full public consultation.  The overall tone was that FSM status remains the default yardstick for targeting the Pupil Development Grant (PDG), but that the Government recognises its limitations and is actively exploring alternatives.\n\nOn the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement, the witnesses pointed to a mixed but generally positive picture.  Estyn\u2019s latest inspection reports note modest improvements in attendance for FSM pupils, and several schools have used PDG to fund \u201cuniversal\u201d interventions that have a disproportionate benefit for the FSM cohort\u2014e.g., growth\u2011mindset training, walking\u2011bus schemes, early\u2011morning teaching\u2011assistant outreach, and the employment of school nurses or counsellors who work with families and other agencies.  These examples were cited as evidence that PDG can help get hard\u2011to\u2011reach children into the classroom, especially at key stage\u202f4 where attendance gaps are widest.  However, the Committee also heard that the attendance differential (35\u202f% of FSM pupils achieving 95\u202f%+ attendance versus 60\u202f% of non\u2011FSM pupils) remains significant and that many schools\u2014particularly those with smaller FSM populations\u2014struggle to deliver comparable initiatives.  Consequently, while the PDG is seen as a useful lever for improving attendance and engagement, the members concluded that its impact is uneven and that stronger, more systematic tracking and evidence\u2011based use of the grant are required to close the remaining gap.",
    "The professor was fairly measured in his assessment of both support\u2011vector machines (SVMs) and speech\u2011rate\u2011based algorithms for speech\u2011recognition.  \n\nOn SVMs he stressed that they are essentially a \u201ccondensed\u2011nearest\u2011neighbor\u201d approach: instead of comparing a test vector to every training example, the classifier keeps only the few \u201csupport vectors\u2019\u2019 that lie closest to the decision boundary.  In his view this gives SVMs a clear advantage over large\u2011parameter models such as multilayer perceptrons or Gaussian\u2011mixture models when the training set is modest, because the model size is dramatically reduced.  He noted that the method can be turned into a probabilistic output by applying a sigmoidal mapping to the distance from the hyper\u2011plane, a trick that has already been tried in a few speech\u2011recognition papers (e.g., the Mississippi State work).  However, he qualified the enthusiasm by saying that published results have been only \u201cokay\u2019\u2019 \u2013 not earth\u2011shattering \u2013 and that systematic, large\u2011scale comparisons with neural nets are still lacking.  Thus, while he sees SVMs as an attractive, compact alternative worth exploring, he does not regard them as a proven replacement for the more established neural\u2011network approaches.\n\nRegarding speech\u2011rate algorithms, the professor did not champion them as a primary cue.  The discussion of voiced/unvoiced discrimination and feature selection focused on energy, spectral shape (e.g., R\u2081/R\u2080), variance of autocorrelation, and raw log\u2011magnitude spectra rather than explicit rate measures.  He implied that speech\u2011rate features, if used, would be just another input to a neural net, but that the net itself can learn the relevant interactions across frames.  Consequently, his stance was that speech\u2011rate\u2011specific algorithms are not a central driver of performance; the emphasis should remain on robust spectral/energy features and letting the neural network discover any useful temporal patterns.",
    "The professor treats echoes, reverberation and acoustic\u2011event detection as three separate but inter\u2011related practical issues in the Aurora experiments.  \n\n**Echoes.** He repeatedly notes that the current system is plagued by \u201clots of insertions\u201d that he attributes to spurious echo artifacts \u2013 essentially delayed copies of speech that overlap with the current phoneme. These echoes confuse the decoder, inflating insertion errors and masking the true acoustic evidence. His view is that the most straightforward cure is to expose the recognizer to more examples of the echo\u2011contaminated data during training so that the model learns to ignore or down\u2011weight the delayed energy. He does not see a simple front\u2011end fix; instead, he suggests that a robust back\u2011end (or a better VAD) is needed to prevent the echo\u2011induced insertions from propagating.\n\n**Reverberation.** The professor stresses that reverberation is especially harmful in low\u2011energy portions of speech, where the reflected energy can dominate the direct signal. He cites classic high\u2011pass filtering (as in Avendano\u2011Hermansky) to attenuate the low\u2011frequency, long\u2011tail components that carry most of the reverberant smear. He also mentions mean\u2011subtraction or spectral\u2011subtraction schemes that attempt to remove a slowly varying reverberation estimate, but warns that these can introduce \u201cfunny\u201d artifacts if the subtraction window is too long. Overall, he advocates a modest, data\u2011driven approach: adjust insertion penalties and scaling only after confirming that reverberation has been sufficiently suppressed.\n\n**Acoustic events.** The professor draws a clear distinction between conventional acoustic features (e.g., mel\u2011cepstrum, PLP) and \u201cacoustic events\u201d \u2013 simple, measurable signal changes such as sudden energy spikes, onsets, or novel spectral patterns that trigger neural firing. He argues that events are more directly tied to perceptual cues and can be hand\u2011labeled or automatically derived to feed higher\u2011level recognizers. In his view, building reliable event detectors (e.g., for voicing, gender, or specific spectral transitions) and feeding their outputs into the SRI system offers a promising route to improve robustness, especially under noisy or reverberant conditions.",
    "The team concluded that the remote\u2019s user\u2011interface should be simple, tactile and unmistakably easy to use, rather than a high\u2011tech \u201cgadget\u201d with a built\u2011in display or full\u2011blown voice control.  \n\n**Key UI features agreed on**\n\n* **Large, clearly labelled buttons** \u2013 the most\u2011used functions (power, volume, channel up/down, numeric entry) will be big, high\u2011contrast keys that can be read at a glance.  \n* **Side\u2011scroll selectors** \u2013 a pair of side\u2011mounted scroll\u2011type buttons (or a small \u201cwheel\u201d) will handle channel and volume changes, reducing the number of separate buttons and keeping the layout uncluttered.  \n* **Central on/off/menu button** \u2013 a slightly larger central button will carry the company logo and serve as the primary \u201center\u201d or menu access point.  \n* **Spongy rubber outer shell** \u2013 the remote will have a soft, rubber\u2011covered case that gives a pleasant, \u201cspongy\u201d feel in the hand while protecting the internal plastic chassis. The cover can be swapped for interchangeable skins (e.g., fruit\u2011patterned sleeves) but the core UI layout stays fixed.  \n* **Colour scheme** \u2013 a bright yellow body with black\u2011printed keys (the corporate colours) was chosen, with optional illuminated key caps that light up yellow when pressed.  \n* **Power source** \u2013 the group favoured a conventional AA/AAA battery solution, with kinetic\u2011energy generation kept as a \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d backup only if cost\u2011effective.  \n\n**Rejected concepts**\n\n* Full\u2011screen LCD on the remote \u2013 deemed too expensive for the target price point.  \n* Voice\u2011recognition or advanced macro programming \u2013 considered costly and unnecessary for the core audience.  \n* Complex \u201cretro telephone\u201d or multi\u2011row button arrays \u2013 judged overly busy and harder to use in low\u2011light conditions.  \n\nIn short, the decision was to move forward with a minimalist push\u2011button remote: a rubber\u2011covered, yellow\u2011and\u2011black device featuring large, well\u2011spaced keys, side scroll selectors, and a central logo button, powered by standard batteries. This balances the 58\u202f% \u201cfancy vs. functional\u201d split, keeps the design technologically simple, and ensures easy operation for the target 15\u201135\u2011year\u2011old market.",
    "During the product\u2011evaluation phase the project manager repeatedly emphasized that the choice of material, cover, colour and overall shape would be driven by cost constraints, ergonomics and the brand\u2019s fashion\u2011forward positioning.\n\n**Plastic material** \u2013 The manager acknowledged that a cheap, injection\u2011moulded plastic shell is the only way to stay within the \u20ac12.5\u202fbudget. He noted that \u201cplastic incurs no cost\u201d compared with more expensive alternatives such as wood or titanium, and that a basic plastic case could be sold as a low\u2011cost edition. He also said the plastic could later be \u201cfancied up\u201d with higher\u2011priced covers, allowing a tiered product line.\n\n**Changeable cover** \u2013 The manager liked the idea of interchangeable skins, describing them as \u201cchangeable covers\u201d that would let users match the remote to their d\u00e9cor, sports team or personal taste. He suggested offering a standard plastic case plus optional decorative covers that could be purchased separately, thereby generating extra revenue while keeping the core unit inexpensive.\n\n**Colour** \u2013 He was clear that the default colour would be a neutral black (or grey) for broad appeal, but that the brand\u2019s fashion mandate required \u201cflashy fruity colours\u201d as a standard visual hook. He proposed a basic bright colour (e.g., yellow or orange) for the entry model and a more sophisticated, possibly wood\u2011tone or metallic finish as an optional premium option.\n\n**Shape** \u2013 The manager favoured a single\u2011curved, solid\u2011body design because a double\u2011curved shell adds roughly \u20ac1 to the bill of materials. He argued that a single curve still provides the ergonomic hand\u2011hold needed for left\u2011 and right\u2011handed users while keeping the unit thin enough to be \u201ceasy to grip.\u201d He also mentioned that the shape could be kept simple to avoid extra tooling costs, with any additional curvature or kinetic features being deferred if the budget could not accommodate them.\n\nIn summary, the project manager\u2019s stance was pragmatic: use inexpensive plastic for the core shell, allow optional changeable covers and vibrant colours to satisfy the fashion\u2011driven brand image, and adopt a single\u2011curve shape to meet both ergonomic and cost targets.",
    "The group spent most of the meeting diagnosing why the current Aurora system was still lagging behind the target baseline and deciding how to \u201cfix\u201d it before the next evaluation deadline.  The main problem was identified as a combination of architectural mismatches and implementation bugs rather than a lack of new algorithms.  In particular, the low\u2011pass\u2011filtered \u201ccombo\u2019\u2019 stream had to be dropped because its latency exceeded the allowable delay, and the silence\u2011detector that was being run on the server could not be used either.  The team therefore agreed to run only the two\u2011stream architecture (the raw feature path plus the OGI\u2011derived path) and to re\u2011weight the three evaluation conditions (well\u2011matched, medium\u2011mismatched, highly\u2011mismatched) with the 40/35/25\u202f% scheme already discussed with Sunil.  They will also add a second, lightweight silence\u2011detector on the handset, but only after a compromise on delay is found.\n\nBaseline improvements were expected from three modest sources.  First, running the neural\u2011net transformation in parallel with the feature extraction (instead of sequentially) gave a small but consistent gain.  Second, the low\u2011pass\u2011filtered cepstral features, while not dramatic, helped a few test cases, especially the highly mismatched Italian set.  Third, removing the KLT on the left\u2011hand path and experimenting with a single\u2011KLT version produced a noticeable boost on the mismatched data, even though it slightly hurt the well\u2011matched condition.\n\nThe team decided to lock the system on the current development data by Tuesday, write up the changes immediately, and then simply re\u2011run the HTK recognizer on the new German and Danish test sets\u2014no additional training will be required.  Significance testing on the test\u2011set sizes (\u2248500\u20132\u202f000 utterances) will be performed to confirm that the observed gains are real and not statistical flukes.  Overall, the consensus was that fixing the identified bugs and streamlining the architecture should yield the bulk of the required improvement, while larger gains will have to await more ambitious research (e.g., LPC\u2011based spectra, spectral subtraction, or added noise).",
    "The committee heard a broad picture of how the pandemic has reshaped policy priorities across several sectors.\n\n**Legislation:**  Members pressed the government on new firearms rules, noting that the legislation targets weapons not intended for hunting or sport while leaving lawful firearms untouched.  The Minister confirmed that the first\u2011reading of a comprehensive gun\u2011control package, including a buy\u2011back programme, will be introduced as soon as possible.  In parallel, there was discussion of possible restrictions on price\u2011promotion and energy\u2011drink sales, but the timing of any health\u2011related statutes was said to be constrained by the current legislative calendar.\n\n**Sports\u2011infrastructure construction:**  Although not a major agenda item, the Minister highlighted the need for health\u2011impact assessments in new public\u2011building projects, including schools, to ensure that changing rooms, gyms and other facilities are built to serve both pupils and the wider community.  The aim is to embed sport\u2011friendly design into the 21st\u2011century schools programme so that schools can double as community sport hubs.\n\n**Government support for energy resources and tourism:**  The government has pledged liquidity measures for the oil\u2011and\u2011gas sector, including loans for large projects and expanded credit\u2011availability for small\u2011 and medium\u2011size firms.  For tourism, the Minister cited targeted funding through the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and other programmes to sustain ferry services, hospitality operators and regional attractions, recognising the sector\u2019s severe downturn.\n\n**Funding for the green economy and small businesses:**  A \u00a3500\u202fmillion green\u2011transition fund was announced, aimed at clean\u2011energy projects, forestry innovation and low\u2011carbon infrastructure.  Small\u2011business relief includes rent\u2011subsidy schemes (up to 75\u202f% of rent covered) and a \u00a377.5\u202fmillion emergency processing fund for agri\u2011food producers, alongside broader credit lines for SMEs.\n\n**Covid\u201119 impact on fishing, tourism, oil and gas:**  The pandemic cut Asian markets for the lobster fishery by up to 95\u202f%, prompting emergency assistance for processors and seasonal workers.  Tourism has been crippled by border closures and travel restrictions, with the government offering $62.5\u202fmillion to processors and pledging additional support for ferry operators.  In oil and gas, falling demand and price wars forced the rollout of liquidity facilities, while Indigenous\u2011owned contractors were urged to receive tailored eligibility reviews.  Overall, the committee stressed that recovery measures must be paired with longer\u2011term sustainability and resilience strategies.",
    "The team agreed early on that the remote should be **function\u2011light**.  Market research showed most users only need power, channel\u2011up/down, volume and a few basic menu buttons; adding DVD, VCR or full\u2011page scrolling would push the design into a \u201cmultifunction\u201d category, raise the bill of materials, and make the product harder to market to the 30\u201160\u2011year\u2011old segment.  Consequently the group voted for a **single\u2011function TV remote** that keeps the button count low and the user interface intuitive.\n\nWhen the shape was raised, a cascade of \u201cfruit\u2011/vegetable\u2011inspired\u201d concepts (banana, lemon, broccoli, hour\u2011glass) was generated.  While the novelty was praised as a way to give the product a trendy personality, several members warned that an overtly gimmicky silhouette could alienate older users and increase tooling costs.  The consensus shifted toward an **ergonomic, single\u2011curved shell**\u2014a gentle curve that fits the hand, allows a rubber\u2011covered grip, and still leaves room for a subtle visual identity (company colours, a bright yellow base).\n\nPersonalisation was explored through interchangeable rubber caps or colour\u2011swap covers.  The idea was liked for its marketing appeal, but the manufacturing team flagged **feasibility concerns**: current suppliers could only guarantee a single\u2011moulded rubber case, and adding a modular system would raise the unit cost beyond the \u20ac12.5 target.  The group therefore postponed full customisation, opting instead for a **fixed, single\u2011curved rubber/latex casing** with a consistent colour scheme, while keeping the option open for future limited\u2011edition skins.\n\nIn short, the final design calls for a **simple, single\u2011function remote housed in a single\u2011curved, spongy rubber case**\u2014trend\u2011aware but not overtly novelty\u2011driven, with personalization deferred until cost constraints can be reassessed.",
    "The marketing team pushed the idea of using bright \u201clemon\u2011or\u2011lime\u201d hues because the latest consumer\u2011trend research shows that European fashion, home\u2011decor and even tech accessories are gravitating toward a fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable colour palette.  In the market\u2011watch segment the team noted an \u201cemerging theme of fruit and vegetables\u201d that is already being applied to clothing, furniture and other lifestyle products.  By adopting a vivid yellow\u2011green shade they can:\n\n1. **Ride the trend** \u2013 the colour directly mirrors the current \u201cfruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable\u201d aesthetic that shoppers associate with freshness, playfulness and a contemporary look.  Using lemon or lime ties the remote to that broader design language, making it feel modern rather than dated.\n\n2. **Differentiate the product** \u2013 most remote controls on the market are dark, utilitarian\u2011looking devices.  A bright, natural colour makes the remote stand out on a coffee\u2011table or couch, increasing visibility and reducing the chance it will be misplaced \u2013 a practical benefit that also reinforces the \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d the research identified as the top consumer priority.\n\n3. **Leverage the corporate palette** \u2013 the company\u2019s corporate colour is already yellow, so a lemon/lime hue can be positioned as an extension of the brand identity while still feeling fresh and vibrant.\n\nIn short, the proposal for lemon or lime colours is a strategic response to a documented market trend toward vivid, fruit\u2011inspired palettes, aiming to give the remote a fashionable, eye\u2011catching appearance that aligns with both consumer expectations and the brand\u2019s visual language.",
    "The team concluded that the new remote\u2011control concept satisfies the revised project brief and can move forward to prototype production, even though the issue of repetitive\u2011strain injury (RSI) remains only partially mitigated.\n\n**Remote\u2011control style** \u2013 A universal, single\u2011handset design was chosen. The layout will be uncluttered, with a flip\u2011open chassis that hides a small LCD touch\u2011screen on the top half and a set of large, rubber\u2011coated \u201cspongy\u201d buttons on the bottom. The overall look will be fashion\u2011forward (bright fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable colours, optional interchangeable fascias) and will carry the corporate logo. The design is deliberately smaller than conventional chunky remotes, but still large enough to avoid cramped button spacing.\n\n**Market\u2011research alignment** \u2013 The user\u2011testing data showed that 80\u202f% of respondents would pay more for a stylish remote, while 50\u202f% only use about ten percent of the buttons. Consequently the team trimmed the function set to the core TV\u2011only commands (power, volume, channel, basic programming) and eliminated teletext and complex video\u2011recording features. Optional add\u2011ons such as voice\u2011recognition and a \u201clost\u2011remote\u201d beeper were noted as premium upgrades rather than core requirements.\n\n**Adjustments made** \u2013 Battery choice shifted from bulky AAA cells to a single rechargeable kinetic cell, reducing bulk and eliminating frequent battery changes. The flip\u2011open mechanism, the rubberised button surface and the optional beeper were introduced to address loss\u2011prevention and ergonomics. A touch\u2011screen replaces many seldom\u2011used buttons, further simplifying the interface.\n\n**RSI minimisation** \u2013 The evaluation gave the RSI\u2011mitigation criterion a neutral\u2011to\u2011low rating. The larger button surface, reduced button count and optional touch\u2011screen are expected to lower strain, but the team acknowledged that current technology cannot fully eliminate the risk. They agreed the remaining risk is acceptable for the first production run, with a plan to revisit ergonomic refinements in later versions.\n\n**Overall verdict** \u2013 The remote meets the primary market\u2011research\u2011driven criteria (style, simplicity, cost, brand image) and the adjustments satisfy the new project requirements. The team voted to proceed to a functional prototype, accepting the modest RSI score as an area for future improvement.",
    "The committee\u2019s assessment of the future of Canada\u2019s institutions was starkly divided. \u202fBruce\u202fStanton reminded members that Canada\u2019s democratic foundations \u2013 the rule of law, universal human rights and the independence of the public service \u2013 remain the bedrock of a resilient system, but he warned that \u201csystemic racism, micro\u2011aggressions and entrenched inequities\u201d still threaten institutional legitimacy. \u202fBy contrast, the Welsh higher\u2011education panel (Dr\u202fDavid\u202fBlaney and Bethan\u202fOwen) warned that Brexit and delayed \u201cDiamond\u201d funding create a funding cliff for universities, jeopardising capital investment, research capacity and student mobility. \u202fBoth bodies agreed that without decisive fiscal support and clear policy signals, the long\u2011term health of their institutions will be at risk.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues featured prominently. \u202fMinister of Diversity and Inclusion Bardish\u202fChagger and Minister of Employment Carla\u202fQualtrough both stressed the need for gender\u2011based data, GBA+ analysis and targeted pandemic relief for women, especially those caring for children or working in precarious jobs. \u202fJagmeet\u202fSingh and Liberal MPs called for universal child\u2011care and a gender\u2011responsive wage\u2011subsidy, noting that women have borne the brunt of job losses and unpaid caregiving. \u202fThe debate repeatedly returned to the failure to fully fund the Canada\u2011housing\u2011benefit and child\u2011care components that would alleviate the disproportionate economic pressure on women.\n\nHousing was another focal point. \u202fJenny\u202fKwan highlighted that only one province has signed on to the Canada Housing Benefit, leaving vulnerable families without promised rental assistance. \u202fMembers from Beauce, Brampton and other ridings echoed the call for a national, funded housing strategy and for the government to honour its commitments to affordable\u2011housing stimulus as part of post\u2011COVID recovery. \u202fThe discussion also touched on Indigenous water access, long\u2011term\u2011care staffing and the need for federal\u2011province coordination.\n\nAcross the meeting, members debated a wide array of topics \u2013 anti\u2011Black and anti\u2011Indigenous racism, firearms bans, agricultural risk\u2011management, small\u2011business relief, tourism support, military assistance in long\u2011term\u2011care, and the Auditor General\u2019s funding \u2013 all framed by the overarching concern that Canada\u2019s institutions must be adequately funded, transparent and inclusive to meet the challenges of the pandemic, systemic inequities and an uncertain economic future.",
    "The team spent most of the meeting reviewing the \u201cmeeting\u2011digit\u201d recordings and how they could be turned into a usable corpus for speech\u2011recognition experiments.  The consensus was that the recordings are almost complete; once the few blank forms are filled, a recognizer can be trained on the digit data.  Graduate\u2011student\u202fF showed a test set extracted from the TI\u2011Digits database and suggested using the standard TI\u2011Digits training set to train a model with the new \u201cgreat features\u201d they have been developing, then testing on the meeting\u2011digit set.  Professor\u202fC noted that the meeting recordings are far noisier than the studio\u2011quality TI\u2011Digits (car\u2011noise, distant microphones, false starts, mis\u2011reads), so performance will be poorer initially (error rates of 3\u20134\u202f% versus \u22480.8\u202f% on TI\u2011Digits).  Nevertheless, the group believes the realistic conditions are valuable for future work.\n\nA key practical issue was how to obtain the digit transcripts.  The transcribers can either hand\u2011type the numbers from the audio or use F\u2019s scripts that automatically extract a digit, display the expected next digit, and record it in a standard format.  The team debated whether to assign this task to the transcribers (who already have IPA training) or to automate it; the majority favored letting transcribers do it because it adds a useful skill and yields more complete transcripts.  A small amount of metadata (name, time, date) must also be entered, which can be done manually or by script.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the need for a modest amount of manually\u2011aligned data to train a pre\u2011segmentation/VAD module.  A few minutes from several meetings (\u22485\u202fmin per meeting, covering different speakers and channel conditions) would provide a training set for forced\u2011alignment and for evaluating the new channel\u2011specific speech\u2011non\u2011speech detector.  Once this \u201cseed\u201d data is in place, the recognizer can be run automatically on the remaining recordings, producing the 12\u202fhours of force\u2011aligned digit data the group needs for downstream experiments.",
    "**Reasons for recommending a speech\u2011recognition interface**\n\n| Stakeholder | Why the team should add speech\u2011recognition | What the feature brings to the product |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **User\u2011Interface (UX) specialist** | The current remote has too many buttons and users often lose track of the correct sequence. A voice command would let the user activate the most common functions (power, volume, channel) with a single spoken word, eliminating the need to remember button patterns. | Faster, more intuitive operation; an oral cue (beep or spoken confirmation) gives immediate feedback that the command was received, reducing the \u201cI don\u2019t know if the remote understood me\u201d frustration. |\n| **Marketing** | Market research shows that 75\u201190\u202f% of the 15\u201135\u202fyear\u2011old segment are willing to pay extra for a voice\u2011controlled remote. Adding speech\u2011recognition creates a clear differentiator that can be promoted as a \u201cfirst\u2011to\u2011market\u201d premium feature, supporting a higher price point (\u2248\u202f\u20ac30\u2011\u20ac35) and reinforcing the brand\u2019s image as innovative and trendy. | A strong selling story (\u201ctalk to your TV\u201d), higher perceived value, ability to command a higher retail price, and a hook for advertising campaigns aimed at tech\u2011savvy consumers. |\n| **Industrial Designer** | A voice interface reduces the need for a dense button layout, allowing a sleeker, more ergonomic shell (plastic\u2011inner / rubber\u2011outer) without sacrificing functionality. It also aligns with the goal of a \u201cuser\u2011oriented, simple\u201d remote that can survive drops and spills\u2014fewer mechanical parts mean fewer failure points. | Simpler mechanical design, lower risk of broken buttons, more design freedom for the external form (color, shape, material) while still delivering all required functions. |\n| **User\u2011Interface Designer (UI\u2011designer)** | Speech recognition can act as a \u201csingle\u2011point entry\u201d for the remote\u2019s core commands, making the UI less cluttered and easier to learn. The designer notes that a one\u2011word command set (e.g., \u201cRemote\u202fon\u201d, \u201cRemote\u202foff\u201d) can be filtered from ambient TV audio if a robust recognizer is used, preventing accidental channel changes while a program is playing. | Cleaner UI with fewer visible controls, reduced cognitive load, and a more graceful user experience\u2014especially for users with limited dexterity or visual impairments. The feature also enables future extensions (e.g., voice\u2011search of program guides) without redesigning the hardware. |\n\n**Overall benefit** \u2013 Across all perspectives, speech recognition is seen as a market\u2011driven innovation that simplifies interaction, enhances the product\u2019s aesthetic and ergonomic appeal, and creates a premium positioning that justifies a higher price while keeping the remote robust and easy to use.",
    "**Work of the consortia \u2013 attitudes and outlook**  \nThe evidence session showed a mixed picture. \u202fAll four regional school\u2011improvement consortia have \u201cimproved their knowledge\u201d of individual schools since the last formal inspection in 2017, but their impact still varies. \u202fConsortia are praised for strong work on literacy and numeracy, yet they lag on digital competence and on supporting secondary schools, where specialist staff are scarce. \u202fSome regions (e.g., Education\u202fAchievement Service) have been able to pool specialist resources, while others (notably Education\u202fRegional Working \u2013\u202fERW) are struggling with leadership turnover, budget uncertainty and a loss of senior staff. \u202fThe Cabinet Secretary, Kirsty\u202fWilliams, reiterated that local authorities are too small to deliver the whole school\u2011improvement agenda alone and that regional consortia remain essential for scale, consistency and the delivery of the new curriculum. \u202fShe warned that dismantling the consortia would \u201crisk destabilising the national model\u201d and stressed the need for a multi\u2011annual funding settlement to give them stability.\n\n**Jassa\u202fScott on the consortia**  \nJassa\u202fScott (Strategic Director, Estyn) said that, although consortia have \u201cimproved their knowledge of individual schools\u2019 strengths and areas for improvement,\u201d they still need to sharpen support for secondary schools, develop a stronger digital\u2011learning agenda and move from ad\u2011hoc to more systematic, multi\u2011agency interventions. \u202fHe noted that Estyn will take a thematic approach over the next year to examine how consortia support curriculum reform and that any future statutory footing for the consortia would be debated in the coming years.\n\n**Comments on the Auditor\u202fGeneral**  \nDuring the session the Auditor\u202fGeneral was mentioned as having faced funding cuts that reduced its audit capacity, raising concerns about the robustness of oversight of education spending. \u202fThe Minister acknowledged the pressure on the Auditor\u202fGeneral\u2019s office and confirmed that the Government will continue to fund the body adequately to safeguard public\u2011accountability.\n\n**Bill\u202fBlair on the Pearson firearms seizure**  \nBill\u202fBlair (Minister for Public Safety) confirmed that, when Quebec asked for assistance after a large seizure of hand\u2011guns at Pearson Airport, the federal government responded promptly and will keep the assistance in place until local capacity can take over. \u202fHe stressed that the operation is part of a broader, coordinated, multi\u2011agency effort to keep communities safe and that continued support will be provided until the threat is neutralised.\n\n**Measures for social stability**  \nBlair also outlined a package of \u201csocial\u2011stability\u201d measures: sustained multi\u2011agency support for schools, enhanced mental\u2011health and well\u2011being services, targeted funding for vulnerable learners, and the continuation of community\u2011school partnerships that link education, health and social services. \u202fThese steps are intended to prevent the spill\u2011over of security concerns into broader social disruption.\n\n**Political background and aim of the group**  \nThe discussion took place before the Children, Young People and Education Committee, a cross\u2011party Senedd committee chaired by Lynne\u202fNeagle. \u202fIts remit is to scrutinise the Welsh Government\u2019s education agenda \u2013 the new curriculum, school\u2011improvement policy and the role of regional consortia \u2013 and to hold the Cabinet Secretary for Education (Kirsty\u202fWilliams) and senior officials to account. \u202fThe committee\u2019s overarching aim is to ensure that the national mission for education delivers higher standards, equitable outcomes and a coherent, well\u2011funded system of school improvement across Wales.",
    "The team\u2019s conversation about the remote\u2019s functions unfolded in three stages: identifying the lost\u2011and\u2011found need, reviewing what the evaluation revealed, and generating fresh feature ideas.\n\n**Lost\u2011and\u2011found function**  \nEarly in the meeting participants all agreed that \u201cwhere is the remote?\u201d is a recurring pain point.  Several proposals emerged: a built\u2011in beacon that emits a beep or a visible LED when the remote is hidden under a newspaper, a plant or in a dark corner; a light sensor that detects low\u2011light conditions and automatically triggers the signal; and a \u201choming\u201d device similar to a phone charger base that can be pressed to make the remote emit sound or flash.  The idea of a rechargeable\u2011battery\u2011powered base that also serves as a locator was mentioned, though cost implications were flagged.\n\n**Improvements from project evaluation**  \nUser\u2011testing showed that 80\u202f% of respondents are dissatisfied with current remotes, especially the excess of unused buttons and difficulty finding the device in low light.  The evaluation therefore reinforced three priorities: reduce button count to the essential functions (power, volume, mute, channel up/down, numeric entry), make the remote ergonomically friendly for older users (larger on/off button, raised symbols), and add a clear visual or audible cue for locating it.  The team also noted that any new feature must stay within the \u20ac8.20\u2011\u20ac12.50 production budget.\n\n**New functions brainstormed**  \nBeyond the locator, the group explored a suite of multi\u2011functional capabilities:  \n- **Universal control** \u2013 infrared and RF modules to manage TV, DVD, set\u2011top box, air\u2011conditioner and heating systems.  \n- **Voice/speech recognition** \u2013 users could say \u201cchannel five\u201d or \u201cmute\u201d and the remote would execute the command; this was highlighted as the primary differentiator for marketing.  \n- **Smart chip** \u2013 a programmable microcontroller to support the above functions without inflating cost.  \n- **Customizable UI** \u2013 a menu button that brings up on\u2011screen settings for audio, video, subtitles and picture\u2011mode, reducing the need for many dedicated buttons.  \n- **Trend\u2011driven design** \u2013 a biomorphic, non\u2011rectangular shape (kidney\u2011 or snail\u2011inspired) with soft\u2011rubber buttons, colored LEDs for status, and recyclable plastic housing.\n\nOverall, the team converged on a streamlined, ergonomic remote that solves the lost\u2011and\u2011found problem, trims unnecessary controls, and adds high\u2011value features\u2014most notably voice control and universal device management\u2014while keeping within budget constraints.",
    "During the finance segment the team revisited the colour\u2011scheme that had been debated earlier.  The consensus was that the remote should not be a single, bland\u2011looking device; the original plan called for **\u201cspecial\u201d button colours** \u2013 up to three different hues per unit \u2013 to give the product a distinctive, \u201cfruity\u201d look, reinforce the corporate yellow\u2011and\u2011black palette and make the remote easy to spot when it is misplaced.  The industrial designer argued that a single colour per case would simplify tooling, while the project manager noted that the extra colour options added cost and could push the bill above the \u20ac12.5 target.  After weighing the budget pressure, the group reluctantly agreed to **standardise all buttons to one colour** (the case remaining the corporate colour) in order to stay within the financial constraints.\n\nMarketing\u2019s dissatisfaction stems from that very decision.  Marketing had championed the multi\u2011colour scheme as a core part of the product\u2019s **fashionable, eye\u2011catching identity** and as a way to differentiate the remote from existing \u201ckids\u2011toy\u2011like\u201d controllers.  By collapsing the buttons to a single hue, the remote lost the visual variety that could appeal to younger users, reduce the risk of it being mistaken for a generic device, and limit the branding opportunities (e.g., colour\u2011coded functions, fruit\u2011inspired palette).  Consequently, Marketing felt the change undermined the product\u2019s market appeal and the strategic goal of positioning the remote as a stylish, easily recognisable accessory.",
    "The\u202fWelsh\u202fdimension was framed as a cross\u2011curricular thread that must be woven into every learning area, not a stand\u2011alone module.\u202fKirsty\u202fWilliams explained that the government is already mapping \u201cwhat matters\u201d statements for each Area of Learning and Experience into primary legislation, ensuring that the Welsh language and cultural contributions are codified and protected.\u202fA separate resource\u2011development programme is under way to produce a national directory of Welsh\u2011dimension teaching materials, and the\u202fMinister stressed that the continuum of learning will be contextualised for Welsh\u2011medium and English\u2011medium schools so that pupils in either setting can progress consistently.\u202fThe discussion also highlighted the need for employer\u2011driven content \u2013 for example, showcasing Welsh contributions to coding \u2013 and for the Welsh dimension to be reflected in assessment and progression frameworks.\n\nEmployers\u2019 grasp of the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh\u202fbac) was uniformly described as weak.\u202fRepresentatives from Colegau\u202fCymru and the civil\u2011engineering sector said the title itself is opaque, that most businesses cannot distinguish the qualification from other routes, and that they receive only tokenistic invitations to schools.\u202fThey argued that the Skills Challenge Certificate is a clearer label, and that genuine employer buy\u2011in will only come if businesses are given ownership of the qualification\u2019s design, linked directly to contractual clauses and social\u2011value contracts, and presented through structured, ongoing partnerships rather than ad\u2011hoc visits.\n\nThe value of an independent inspectorate \u2013 Estyn \u2013 was presented as a uniquely Welsh asset.\u202fEstyn\u2019s peer\u2011inspector and nominee system, developed over decades, allows inspections to be calibrated to Wales\u2019 specific curriculum reforms and cultural context, something that Ofsted\u2019s English model cannot replicate.\u202fIts focus on self\u2011evaluation, learning\u2011organisation culture and a separate accountability regime provides public confidence while avoiding the league\u2011table pressures seen elsewhere.\u202fThus, an independent body offers Wales a tailored, transparent, and collaborative approach to quality assurance that supports the new curriculum, the Welsh dimension and the broader goals of the education system.",
    "The team\u2019s consensus on the convenience of the presentation\u2011tool kit was mixed, leaning toward \u201cgood enough\u201d but with clear pain points.  \n\n**What worked well**  \n- **Physical supplies (pens, whiteboard, markers)** were praised as the most reliable part of the set. The industrial designer noted that the pens \u201cshow up here\u201d on the board, making the writing visible without having to stare at a screen. The user\u2011interface specialist agreed that the whiteboard was handy for quick sketches, even if the marker sometimes stalled.  \n- **Simple, low\u2011tech visuals** (hand\u2011drawn sketches, basic diagrams) were seen as \u201cvery helpful\u201d and easy for everyone to understand without needing extra software.\n\n**What didn\u2019t**  \n- **PowerPoint and other slide\u2011deck tools** generated the strongest dislike. Multiple participants (the user\u2011interface lead, the project manager, and the industrial designer) called PowerPoint \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201ckinda useless,\u201d and \u201ca waste of time.\u201d They felt the slides added little value and distracted from the core discussion.  \n- **Software compatibility** was another friction point. The industrial designer preferred Unix/WordPerfect, while the project manager relied on Microsoft tools. The designer complained about having to hunt down old WordPerfect disks for colleagues who only had modern Microsoft suites, creating unnecessary delays.  \n- **Digital note\u2011taking** (e.g., microphones, video recordings) was viewed as overkill. The user\u2011interface person said microphones were \u201cclumsy\u201d when moving to the whiteboard, and the group questioned the benefit of watching a two\u2011hour video of a meeting they could summarize in a single sentence.\n\n**Overall take\u2011away**  \nThe group concluded that low\u2011tech, tactile materials (pens, whiteboard, simple sketches) are the most convenient and effective for their meetings, while high\u2011tech slide decks and mismatched software ecosystems hinder productivity. They suggested limiting future sessions to the \u201cnice pens and board\u201d approach and reserving digital tools only for essential, universally accessible content.",
    "The team ruled out an LCD screen because it would add unnecessary cost, complexity, and usability problems without delivering real value. Throughout the discussion the engineers repeatedly noted that an LCD requires an **advanced logic chip**, which is more expensive than the simple chip needed for push\u2011buttons. Since the remote\u2019s primary goal is a \u201cfancy look\u2011and\u2011feel\u201d while keeping the price low, the extra expense of an advanced chip and the power\u2011draw of a back\u2011lit display were seen as a budget\u2011draining luxury.\n\nFrom a user\u2011experience standpoint the group argued that a small LCD would force the user to **look down at the remote and then back at the TV**, breaking the natural viewing flow. They also pointed out that the display would be **one\u2011way only**\u2014the remote could show information but could not receive feedback from the TV\u2014so any menu or channel information could just as easily be shown on the TV screen itself. Consequently, the LCD would not improve functionality, only add a visual gimmick.\n\nFinally, the team emphasized that the remote already needed to accommodate other design priorities (spongy rubber case, kinetic or solar power, large essential buttons, and a possible scroll wheel). Adding an LCD would complicate the hardware, increase power requirements, and conflict with the goal of a **simple, low\u2011cost, fashion\u2011forward device**. For these reasons the LCD option was dismissed in favor of a straightforward push\u2011button interface.",
    "The team began each session with brief self\u2011introductions, stating names and roles (project manager, user\u2011interface designer, industrial designer, marketing lead) and a quick \u201cfavorite animal\u201d ice\u2011breaker to build rapport. They then launched the project: a low\u2011cost, trendy TV remote shaped like a banana, priced at \u20ac25 with a production target of \u20ac12.50 per unit. The brief emphasized a simple look\u2011and\u2011feel, ergonomic scroll wheels, a turbo button that also powers the TV, a base\u2011station that doubles as a locator antenna, solar\u2011cell optional charging, and no LCD or speech\u2011recognition.\n\nDuring brainstorming the group generated many ideas: dual scroll wheels for volume/channel, a teletext\u2011mode that repurposes the wheels, a single turbo button for on/off, a detachable battery, colour\u2011coded buttons, and a \u201cbanana leaf\u201d base\u2011station. Constraints such as cost, limited surface area, and target demographic (young, style\u2011conscious users) forced trade\u2011offs \u2013 e.g., dropping the LCD, using a regular chip, and limiting rubber or extra buttons. The team used whiteboards, digital pens, and occasional prototypes (Play\u2011Doh models) to visualise concepts, but noted that the tools sometimes hindered collaboration.\n\nEvaluation was carried out with a 1\u2011to\u20117 rating scale on criteria like fanciness, functionality, cost compliance, and market appeal. Scores hovered between 3 and 6, indicating moderate satisfaction but concerns about price, button ergonomics, and the novelty of a banana shape. The group discussed whether to prioritize a higher\u2011priced premium design or a stripped\u2011down, cheaper version.\n\nThe project process followed a structured cycle: initial introductions \u2192 requirement gathering \u2192 conceptual brainstorming \u2192 rapid sketching/prototyping \u2192 cost analysis \u2192 criteria\u2011based evaluation \u2192 decision on design trade\u2011offs \u2192 assignment of detailed design tasks (industrial design of housing, UI functional design, marketing positioning). The team agreed on next steps: refine the single\u2011curved ergonomic shell, finalize button layout, and prepare a concise presentation for stakeholder approval.",
    "During the \u201cextra\u2011designs/gadgets\u201d segment the team examined the idea of making the remote rechargeable from several angles:\n\n* **Concept acceptance** \u2013 Both the project manager and the industrial designer liked the notion of a chargeable remote, describing it as a \u201ccomfort\u201d feature that would eliminate the annoyance of constantly replacing batteries. The user\u2011interface lead agreed that a rechargeable option could be attractive, especially if it avoided the remote dying mid\u2011session.\n\n* **Technical feasibility** \u2013 The industrial designer pointed out that the remote already contains a compact circuit board, so swapping standard AA/AAA cells for rechargeable \u201cPenlite\u201d cells was technically possible. However, the designer warned that integrating a charging circuit and a docking station would increase the internal volume and might require a thicker housing. The project manager questioned whether a built\u2011in charging port or a separate base\u2011station would be affordable, noting that a simple wired dock could be added but would add parts and assembly steps.\n\n* **Cost considerations** \u2013 The group repeatedly returned to the \u20ac25 target price. The project manager and marketing expressed concern that rechargeable batteries and a charging dock could push the bill of materials beyond the budget, especially for a basic remote. Marketing suggested testing whether customers would pay a premium for the convenience; the user\u2011interface lead noted that younger users might be willing to spend more, while older users value simplicity over extra features.\n\n* **User\u2011experience trade\u2011offs** \u2013 Some participants worried that a rechargeable remote could create a new failure mode: if the user forgets to charge it, the remote becomes unusable. The suggestion was to keep the option of using regular disposable cells as a backup, allowing the device to operate even when the internal battery is low.\n\n* **Decision direction** \u2013 The consensus was that a rechargeable version is an appealing \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d feature, but it should be treated as an optional upgrade rather than a baseline requirement. The team agreed to investigate the exact cost of rechargeable cells, a minimal charging dock, and market willingness to pay before committing to the design.",
    "The group concluded that the lack of uniformity among the close\u2011talk microphones is a serious obstacle for dialogue\u2011 and prosody\u2011focused research. Because each speaker\u2019s lapel or head\u2011mounted mic is positioned differently, the transcribers must constantly compensate for varying signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratios and cross\u2011talk, which degrades forced\u2011alignment and downstream acoustic analysis.  \n\nTo eliminate this source of variability the team voted to standardize the microphone array. The plan is to select a single model that satisfies two criteria\u2014high\u2011quality close\u2011talk capture and reasonable wearer comfort\u2014and then order a modest batch (about half a dozen) for the lab. Before committing to a larger purchase, one unit will be tested on a few participants to confirm that the placement (corner of the mouth, thumb\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half away) yields clean speech without excessive breath or handling noise. If the trial confirms the expected improvement, the remaining microphones will be bought and deployed across all speakers, replacing the current mix of lapel, head\u2011mounted, and ad\u2011hoc devices.  \n\nThe decision explicitly rejects the idea of adding a heterogeneous set of wireless or array microphones at this stage, emphasizing that uniformity outweighs the marginal benefit of having more channels or different form factors. The group will retain a few spare mics as backups, but the primary goal is a fully standardized set so that every speaker is recorded with the same acoustic characteristics, simplifying preprocessing, speaker\u2011segmentation, and transcription accuracy.",
    "**Meilyr\u202fRowlands (Chief Inspector, Estyn)**  \n\n-\u202fRowlands warned that secondary schools are under a \u201cgreater challenge\u201d than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum, noting that many secondary establishments are operating with a financial deficit and that the decline in reserves for secondary schools limits the time they can devote to curriculum planning and professional development.  \n-\u202fHe highlighted that the well\u2011being of pupils in secondary settings is markedly lower: confidence that the school will look after their emotional and mental health falls from about nine\u2011in\u2011ten at Key\u202fStage\u202f2 to roughly half at Key\u202fStage\u202f4. He linked this to limited well\u2011being staff, reduced funding for pastoral roles and the difficulty secondary schools have in building sustained relationships with larger, more transient pupil groups.  \n-\u202fRowlands also pointed out that the pandemic has amplified the need for multi\u2011agency support for vulnerable learners, and that the current \u201cwell\u2011being support assistants, family liaison workers and similar posts\u201d are often the first to be cut when budgets tighten, further jeopardising emotional\u2011health provision.  \n\n**Kirsty\u202fWilliams\u202fAM (Minister for Education)**  \n\n-\u202fWilliams stressed that any move to a new phase of schooling will be \u201cphased\u201d and only proceed when the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Officer confirm it is safe. She outlined practical safety measures for school hubs \u2013 social\u2011distancing, transport planning, gate\u2011control, robust testing and tracing, and the need for adequate staffing levels.  \n-\u202fShe confirmed that the government is increasing mental\u2011health support: additional funding will be made available to local authorities for telephone and video counselling, family\u2011therapy options and professional\u2011development for counsellors, ensuring that children who remain at home continue to receive remote well\u2011being services.  \n-\u202fRegarding home learning, Williams thanked parents for their effort, pointed families to the \u201cStay Learning\u201d guidance on the Hwb platform, and stressed that the guidance is not prescriptive \u2013 parents should not be \u201ctoo hard on themselves\u201d. She also described the national hardware\u2011and\u2011connectivity programme (lending Chromebooks/iPads and providing Mi\u2011Fi kits) to guarantee that pupils can study from home with the necessary digital tools.",
    "During the detailed\u2011design session Sebastian, the Industrial Designer, repeatedly returned to the idea of a **spherical (ball\u2011shaped) remote** and weighed its visual appeal against practical constraints.\n\n**Design & Style**  \nHe liked the \u201ctrendy, futuristic\u201d look of a sphere \u2013 even comparing it to something out of *Star Wars* \u2013 and felt a ball could give the product a distinctive, fashion\u2011forward identity. However, he warned that a pure sphere will roll away, so a **flat spot or a built\u2011in base** is required to keep it stable on a table or a couch. He suggested adding **side grips or a textured surface** to improve hand\u2011hold and prevent accidental rolling. He also questioned the feasibility of a hinge or a lid, noting that opening and closing a ball would create a weak point that could break easily. Overall, he saw the ball as a bold stylistic choice but one that must be tempered with ergonomic realities.\n\n**Functionality**  \nSebastian stressed that the remote must remain **easy to use**: large, well\u2011spaced buttons that can be felt without looking, possibly with **glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark or back\u2011lit indicators** for low\u2011light use. He favored a **minimal button layout**\u2014only the essential controls for channel, volume, and source\u2014while still supporting **universal operation** via both **infra\u2011red and Bluetooth**. He raised concerns about range, noting that infrared requires line\u2011of\u2011sight, whereas Bluetooth could extend the usable distance (e.g., for a garden speaker). He also mentioned a **possible small display** to show functions, but dismissed it as too costly for the target price of \u20ac12.50 per unit.\n\n**Durability & Cost**  \nFinally, Sebastian highlighted the need for a **robust, child\u2011proof shell** that can survive drops and repeated handling, yet stay within the tight **production\u2011cost ceiling**. He concluded that the spherical concept is attractive, but its success hinges on balancing the eye\u2011catching shape with a flat, gripped base, simple tactile controls, and a reliable dual\u2011technology communication system.",
    "The committee heard a clear, mixed\u2011feelings view on Erasmus\u2011plus and student\u2011mobility funding. \u202fWitnesses stressed that the programme still underpins a large share of Wales\u2019s international\u2011exchange activity \u2013 for example, at Cardiff University only about 40\u202f% of mobility costs are covered by other sources, the rest coming from Erasmus. \u202fBecause the EU\u2011funded scheme is now uncertain, several speakers argued that Welsh institutions should begin to earmark part of their own fee\u2011income for mobility, rather than relying entirely on a programme that may disappear. \u202fAt the same time, they warned that trying to replace Erasmus with a wholly Welsh\u2011funded alternative would be far less efficient and considerably more expensive, and that the brand and recognised quality of Erasmus\u2011plus should be preserved as far as possible. \u202fOverall the group\u2019s stance is: maintain the Erasmus link if it can be salvaged, and, in parallel, encourage universities to take greater responsibility for financing student mobility through their own budgets.\n\nOn the question of tuition\u2011fee refunds, the evidence did not support a blanket refund policy. \u202fHuw\u202fMorris explained that existing quality\u2011assurance, student\u2011charter and complaints mechanisms \u2013 including appeals, union representation and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator \u2013 are in place to address any shortfall in the learning experience. \u202fIf a course is not delivered as promised, students can raise concerns through those routes; only then might a refund be considered. \u202fThus the committee\u2019s position is that refunds should be handled case\u2011by\u2011case via the established grievance procedures rather than through an automatic, sector\u2011wide tuition\u2011fee repayment scheme.",
    "The meetings repeatedly returned to five themes.\n\n**Local authoritative frameworks** \u2013 Speakers highlighted the need for clearer, locally\u2011driven commissioning and quality\u2011assurance structures for \u201cEducation Otherwise Than at School\u201d (EOTAS) and pupil\u2011referral units.  The Welsh committee discussed regional\u2011skills partnerships, urging transparency, better governance and stronger links with local authorities so that funding follows the learner and standards are uniformly applied.  In Canada, the federal government was asked to coordinate with provinces on health\u2011transfer formulas and to streamline border\u2011crossing rules for families, while provincial ministries spoke of developing provincial\u2011wide frameworks for apprenticeship and post\u201116 provision.\n\n**Condolences** \u2013 Numerous members offered tributes: the House mourned the death of Mayor\u202fStephan\u202fLavoie in Abitibi, the passing of journalist Tristan\u202fRoy, and the loss of community leaders such as John\u202fLavoie and others.  Parallel condolences were expressed for victims of systemic racism, for Indigenous and Black Canadians killed by police, and for families of those who died in long\u2011term\u2011care facilities during the pandemic.\n\n**Employment** \u2013 The pandemic\u2011era wage\u2011subsidy (CEWS), emergency business loan (CEBA) and Canada\u2011Emergency\u2011Response\u2011Benefit were repeatedly cited as essential supports.  Members raised concerns about the Supplementary Unemployment Benefits (SUB) clash with CERB limits, the need for flexible eligibility for youth and seasonal workers, and the request that Indigenous communities receive equitable access to the Canada\u2011Summer\u2011Jobs program.\n\n**Workers\u2019 safety** \u2013 Discussions covered PPE procurement (including the Deloitte contract and domestic production), the military\u2019s role in long\u2011term\u2011care facilities, and the recent firearms\u2011order\u2011council that bans weapons deemed unsafe.  Calls were made for stronger occupational\u2011health measures, especially for frontline health workers and those in high\u2011risk sectors such as forestry and construction.\n\n**Pay\u2011dispute situations** \u2013 The FE\u2011college pay dispute (ColegauCymru) dominated the labour\u2011policy segment.  Unions demanded a 3.5\u202f% increase (\u2248\u202f$10\u202fmillion) to bring college salaries in line with school\u2011teacher wages, while the government said it was monitoring the negotiations and would intervene only after collective bargaining concluded.  The broader issue of wage\u2011subsidy eligibility for small businesses and the need for clear guidance on employer contributions also featured.",
    "The member speaking from Whitehorse used her remarks to acknowledge two distinct contributions.  \n\nFirst, she thanked the House of Commons for giving her the opportunity to address the chamber from the Yukon\u2019s capital, noting that the privilege of speaking on the floor from Whitehorse \u2013 and on the traditional territory of the Kwanlin\u202fD\u00e4n\u202fFirst Nation and the Ta\u2019an\u202fKw\u00e4ch\u02bc\u00e4n Council \u2013 underscores the Parliament\u2019s willingness to include northern voices in the national conversation.  \n\nSecond, she expressed gratitude to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for the \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d they have provided in long\u2011term\u2011care facilities across the country.  Their deployment to these homes helped expose the dire conditions seniors were facing and demonstrated the Armed Forces\u2019 vital role in supporting vulnerable Canadians during the pandemic.  \n\nIn short, the thanks were for (1) the House of Commons\u2019 openness to a northern perspective and (2) the Canadian Armed Forces\u2019 critical support to long\u2011term\u2011care residents.",
    "The team agreed that the remote must first and foremost satisfy the **core TV\u2011control function** \u2013 power, channel\u2011up/down and volume \u2013 and that this requirement is the highest\u2011priority functional need.  All other features are secondary and must be justified against the \u20ac12.5 production\u2011cost ceiling and the \u20ac25 selling price.  \n\n**Core functions discussed**  \n* Infra\u2011red transmission to a single television (multi\u2011device programming was considered but later dropped).  \n* A \u201cfind\u2011my\u2011remote\u201d locator that emits a beep or vibration when a button on the TV or a wall\u2011mounted transmitter is pressed.  \n* Optional voice\u2011recognition for channel or power commands \u2013 attractive to the 15\u201135\u202fyr demographic but flagged as costly and therefore a possible future upgrade rather than a baseline requirement.  \n\n**User characters and target groups**  \n* Primary market: fashion\u2011aware young adults (15\u201135\u202fyr) who value a sleek look, colour customisation (banana\u2011yellow, strawberry\u2011red, autumn tones) and tactile feedback.  \n* Secondary market: older users who need larger, raised or tactile buttons, high contrast markings and a lock\u2011function to prevent accidental presses.  \n\n**Design requirements**  \n* **Form factor** \u2013 a single\u2011sided, ergonomically curved case made from high\u2011quality recycled rubber or hard\u2011plastic; round\u2011corners on a square silhouette for a \u201cfashion\u2011in\u2011electronics\u201d feel.  \n* **Interface** \u2013 a small LCD or touch\u2011screen that can display a few pages of menus; the screen is not mandatory if cost spikes, but a side\u2011mounted **scroll device** (a thin rotary or swipe strip) was agreed on as the preferred way to navigate menus without adding many physical buttons.  \n* **Visual cues** \u2013 optional illuminated or glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark buttons for low\u2011light use; colour\u2011coded groups of buttons to aid quick identification.  \n* **Power** \u2013 rechargeable battery with a docking station; the team noted that lithium cells must be evaluated for cost\u2011effectiveness.  \n\nIn short, the remote will be a minimalist, TV\u2011only controller with a reliable IR link, a locator beacon, and a scroll\u2011based menu navigation system; additional features such as voice control or a full\u2011screen LCD are deferred until the budget permits.",
    "The next team meeting will be framed around three core agenda items.  \n\n**1. Review of the current design direction and functional priorities** \u2013 The group will recap the remote\u2011control specifications that were agreed in the last session: a slim, fashionable device that emphasizes the most\u2011used functions (channel change and volume), a minimal button set, and a pull\u2011out panel for secondary features. The team will confirm the status of the prototype, verify that the infrared signal, battery system and optional solar cell are still viable, and decide whether to keep voice\u2011recognition or drop it to stay within the \u20ac12.50 production target.  \n\n**2. Marketing\u2019s health\u2011usability concern \u2013 Repetitive\u2011Strain Injury (RSI)** \u2013 Marketing raised the issue that users are reporting hand fatigue and carpal\u2011tunnel\u2011type discomfort from prolonged remote use. The user\u2011interface lead clarified that RSI (repetitive\u2011strain injury) was identified in the usability lab as a major frustration. The upcoming meeting will allocate time for the design team to propose ergonomic solutions\u2014larger, spaced\u2011out buttons, a softer\u2011touch rubber coating, or a detachable grip\u2014and for marketing to evaluate how these changes affect the \u201cfashion\u2011forward\u201d image and cost structure.  \n\n**3. Reflection on past meetings and progress tracking** \u2013 The group will conduct a brief retrospective, noting that previous sessions successfully produced a functional prototype, gathered user data, and clarified budget constraints, but also highlighted gaps in communication (missing slide decks, uneven information flow) and the need for clearer role assignments. Action items will be reviewed, deadlines for individual deliverables (industrial design components, UI mock\u2011ups, cost analysis) will be confirmed, and a shared folder will be audited to ensure all documentation is accessible before the next design review.  \n\nOverall, the meeting will solidify the remote\u2019s core functions, integrate ergonomic considerations for RSI, and tighten project coordination based on lessons learned.",
    "**Lab\u2011test findings on button design**  \nThe usability lab that tested 100 participants showed that current remotes are perceived as cluttered and hard to use. Only about\u202f10\u202f% of the existing buttons are used regularly; the three most\u2011used controls are power, channel\u2011up/down and volume\u2011up/down. Users reported frequent loss of the remote and expressed a strong desire for a \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d feature. Participants also preferred larger, well\u2011spaced buttons and a more ergonomic shape, and they were willing to pay a premium for a sleeker, more fashionable design.\n\n**Discussion of the finder (or \u201ccall\u201d) button**  \nThe team repeatedly returned to the idea of a finder button that would help locate a misplaced remote. The concept is a small button placed on the TV (or on a base unit) that, when pressed, sends a signal to the remote causing it to emit a beep or flash. Several options were debated: an IR\u2011based cue, a radio\u2011frequency transmitter, or a simple speaker on the remote. The consensus was to adopt a radio\u2011type transmitter on the TV and a buzzer on the remote, because IR would require line\u2011of\u2011sight and the radio solution works even when the remote is under a couch.\n\n**Details of button design and location function**  \nDesigners agreed on a minimalist layout: a large on/off button, dedicated channel\u2011up/down and volume\u2011up/down buttons, and a single \u201cmenu\u201d button that brings up additional functions on the TV screen. A joystick or touch\u2011pad was suggested for navigating menus, but any extra controls would be hidden behind the menu layer. Button size should be larger than on typical remotes but not childish; the layout should keep frequently used keys grouped together. For the location function, the remote will contain a small speaker (or buzzer) and a radio receiver; the TV will host the transmitter that is activated by the finder button.\n\n**Agreement on lighting\u2011adaptive options**  \nWhen the market\u2011interest presentation touched on adaptive lighting (auto\u2011adjusting back\u2011lights or LEDs based on ambient light), the group concluded that the feature adds little perceived value. The market research indicated that users do not consider lighting adaptation a priority, and the added hardware cost and power consumption were deemed unnecessary. Consequently, the team agreed to drop adaptive\u2011lighting from the baseline product and focus on the core button and finder functionality.",
    "The team\u2019s discussion on **DAT recorders** was brief but pointed.  The LDC \u201cSanta\u202fBarbara\u201d corpus is released on DAT, and several members noted that the recordings are far\u2011field, single\u2011channel tapes that could be useful for testing the recognizer on realistic meeting audio.  Because the DAT data are already segmented into \u201cspeech\u2011only\u201d sections, the group saw them as a convenient source of \u201cclean\u201d training material that could be compared with the more noisy, multi\u2011mic meeting recordings they are collecting.  The consensus was that DAT would be valuable for a baseline evaluation, but that any analysis would still need to address the far\u2011field channel mismatch that occurs in real meetings.\n\nOn **power cables and microphone wiring**, the conversation focused on the practical problems of supplying low\u2011voltage phantom power to lapel microphones, routing the XLR and mini\u2011jack leads, and providing visual status (LED) on the power supplies.  Several proposals were raised: (1) replace the existing Crown head\u2011set mics with comfortable Crown ear\u2011mount units that include integrated phantom power; (2) use a simple patch\u2011panel to bundle the twelve\u2011channel cables and keep the LED indicator as a \u201clive\u2011wire\u201d check; (3) keep the old wired mics as backups while the new wireless units are tested.  The group agreed that a clean, well\u2011labelled cable layout is essential for reliable segmentation and for minimizing cross\u2011talk in the recordings.\n\nRegarding **capturing subject intention**, the team outlined a high\u2011level experimental design in which subjects are given a schematic tourist map and asked to choose abstract tasks (e.g., \u201cgo shopping\u201d, \u201ctake a picture\u201d).  The intention is recorded explicitly before the interaction, allowing the system to compare the subject\u2019s stated goal with the spoken commands they actually issue.  Two analysis approaches were considered:\n\n1. **Intent\u2011driven schema mapping** \u2013 encode each utterance with a Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal (SPG) schema and, where appropriate, a richer action schema (forced motion, caused action).  This permits the recognizer to link spoken language to the pre\u2011registered intention and to evaluate mismatches.\n\n2. **Feature\u2011level acoustic modeling** \u2013 train recognizers on the TI\u2011digits corpus, then test on the meeting data, adding articulatory\u2011feature labeling (voicing, nasality, points of articulation) to see whether fine\u2011grained phonetic cues improve intention detection, especially for short, predictable digit strings versus more spontaneous speech.\n\nBoth routes will be piloted: the first with a small set of subjects to validate the intention\u2011capture protocol, the second with automatic forced\u2011alignment on the pre\u2011segmented meeting audio to generate a larger training set for statistical analysis.",
    "The team spent most of the meeting defining the **general specification** for the new remote and then debating the **case design**.  \n\n**General specification** \u2013 All participants agreed that the remote must keep the core functions (on/off, volume, channel up/down, numeric entry and a small LCD\u2011screen for status).  The LCD was kept, but the advanced\u2011function panel was relegated to \u201chidden\u201d menu items to save space and cost.  Power will be supplied by a standard replaceable battery rather than the kinetic\u2011energy concept, because kinetic charging would raise the price and was judged unsuitable for the senior\u2011user target group.  The docking\u2011station will provide charging and a \u201cfind\u2011remote\u201d beep function.  Voice\u2011recognition was dropped from the baseline design because the 60\u201180\u2011year\u2011old segment showed little willingness to pay for it.  \n\n**Case design** \u2013 The industrial designer presented three shape options: a flat case, a single\u2011curved case and a double\u2011curved case.  The group leaned toward the **single\u2011curved** form because it allows a comfortable grip and a natural location for the LCD while staying within the budget.  Material options were a plain plastic shell, a wood\u2011like finish, and a grey\u2011black finish.  Marketing pushed for two colour lines (wood\u2011like and grey\u2011black) to give a \u201cfashionable\u201d look, while the project manager warned that a wood finish would increase cost.  The compromise reached was to produce **one standard plastic case** with **interchangeable covers** \u2013 a removable wood\u2011like cover and a plastic/grey\u2011black cover that can be swapped by the user.  This satisfies the desire for personalization without creating a second full product line.  \n\n**Changes to the current design** \u2013 The group decided to drop the kinetic\u2011energy source, eliminate the extra LCD\u2011panel and advanced chip, and replace the original \u201csnow\u2011man\u201d shape with the single\u2011curved, interchangeable\u2011cover concept.  The rubber anti\u2011slip belt was also abandoned for cost reasons.  These adjustments keep the remote simple, affordable (\u2248\u202f12\u202f\u20ac production cost) and still allow a premium look through optional case skins.",
    "Huw\u202fDavid, speaking on behalf of the Welsh Local Government Association, made three linked points about the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill.\n\n**Unintended consequences** \u2013 David stressed that any negative side\u2011effects would hinge on poor implementation rather than the substance of the legislation. He warned that, without sufficient resources, the Bill could add pressure to already overstretched children\u2019s services and risk \u201cover\u2011referral\u201d or unnecessary long\u2011term social\u2011service involvement. However, he argued that, if the law is rolled out with the required awareness\u2011raising, early\u2011intervention programmes and adequate funding, those unintended outcomes should be avoided. In his view the risk is manageable and not inherent to the Bill itself.\n\n**Legislation versus natural cultural change** \u2013 David noted that Welsh society has already moved away from physical punishment: \u201cthe vast majority of parents now say they do not use it and do not support it.\u201d He described the Bill as a formal acknowledgment of a cultural shift that has been occurring over the past three to four decades. Rather than trying to legislate a behaviour that is already disappearing, the Bill codifies the new norm and provides legal clarity, ensuring the law does not lag behind practice.\n\n**Should the duty to raise awareness be written into the Bill?** \u2013 Initially David said the Welsh Government already had a commitment to an awareness\u2011raising campaign, but he later changed his position, stating that the duty should be expressly placed on Ministers in the legislation. He argued that a statutory duty would make the responsibility clear to local authorities and front\u2011line services, guarantee funding, and avoid any ambiguity about who must deliver the campaign.\n\nIn sum, David believes the Bill\u2019s unintended consequences are avoidable with proper resourcing, that legislation is needed to cement an already\u2011evolving cultural norm, and that an explicit awareness\u2011raising duty should be included in the Bill\u2019s text.",
    "The team regarded the two\u2011sided remote as a promising way to combine a full\u2011feature side with a minimalist side, but they were far from convinced that it would meet all the project constraints.\n\n**Design and functionality**  \n- The concept was to have a \u201cflip\u2011open\u201d side that exposes a complete set of push\u2011buttons (up, down, left, right, on/off, menu) and a \u201cclosed\u201d side that shows only the essential channel\u2011up/down and volume controls.  \n- Several form\u2011factor ideas were discussed: a smooth hard\u2011plastic shell versus a spongy rubber\u2011cased shell, a single\u2011curve \u201cbanana\u201d shape, or a more conventional rounded block. The group leaned toward a simple, ergonomic shape with a single curve, avoiding the double\u2011curved design because it would raise cost and complicate molding.  \n- Colour and branding were settled on bright yellow with black buttons, matching the corporate palette; the logo and slogan would be printed on the case.  \n\n**Evaluation and market range**  \n- In the scoring exercise the two\u2011sided remote received mixed marks: it scored well on \u201csellable\u201d, \u201ctrendy\u201d and \u201ceasy to use\u201d, but lower on \u201ctechnologically innovative\u201d (because it retained only push\u2011button technology) and on \u201cfancy\u201d (the team felt it was not especially avant\u2011garde). Overall the average rating was around 1.8\u20132 on a 1\u20117 scale, which the group described as \u201cacceptable but not outstanding\u201d.  \n- The market positioning was aimed at a mass\u2011consumer segment (price target \u20ac25, production cost \u2264 \u20ac12.50). The remote was to be an impulse\u2011buy Christmas gift, appealing to families with children, but also simple enough for elderly users.  \n\n**Technical requirements**  \n- Water\u2011proofing and shock\u2011proofing were identified as desirable \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d features to differentiate the product. The project manager suggested integrating a waterproof seal and a rugged rubber overlay, but the industrial designer warned that adding a full waterproof housing would push the cost above the budget ceiling.  \n- Shock resistance was considered essential because users frequently drop remotes; a hard\u2011plastic core was seen as the most reliable way to meet this need, while the rubber\u2011casing would add grip and some impact absorption.  \n\nIn summary, the group liked the two\u2011sided concept for its simplicity and market appeal, gave it a modest evaluation score, and agreed that water\u2011proof and shock\u2011proof capabilities are valuable but must be balanced against the tight cost target.",
    "Group\u202f3 focused on the technical question of how the Bill\u2019s core provision \u2013 the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment \u2013 will be brought into force and what regulatory powers will be available to implement it.  Julie\u202fMorgan moved amendment\u202f3 to restore the Welsh\u2011Minister\u2019s power to make a commencement Order after amendments\u202f7 and\u202f8 had removed it.  She argued that, without a statutory commencement power, the Bill would lose a useful tool for timing the change and for allowing the Government to introduce any necessary secondary legislation.  The Minister accepted that the existing transitory, transitional and saving provisions might be sufficient for now, but she welcomed the idea of reviewing the matter at Stage\u202f3.\n\nAmendment\u202f3A was described by the Chair as a \u201cprobing\u201d or \u201cholding\u201d amendment \u2013 a way of keeping the issue of broader regulation\u2011making powers on the agenda.  The amendment invites a later discussion about whether the limited powers in the Bill will be enough to support the awareness\u2011raising campaign, the post\u2011implementation reporting regime and any other measures needed to give effect to section\u202f1.\n\nSuzy\u202fDavies moved amendment\u202f3A and used the opportunity to stress her concern that the Bill should not become dependent on guidance from non\u2011devolved bodies such as the Crown\u202fProsecution Service or the police.  She argued that giving those bodies any de\u2011facto control over when the legislation can commence would undermine Welsh parliamentary sovereignty and create uncertainty for parents.  Davies welcomed the \u201cholding\u201d nature of 3A because it allows the Assembly to revisit the scope of regulatory powers before Stage\u202f3, ensuring that any future powers are clearly defined and remain within devolved competence.  Other members (e.g. Hefin\u202fDavid) indicated that, for the moment, the limited powers are acceptable but agreed they would be reviewed later.  In sum, Group\u202f3 produced a consensus to restore the ministerial commencement power (amendment\u202f3) and to keep open the question of whether broader regulation\u2011making powers are needed (amendment\u202f3A), with Suzy\u202fDavies championing the need for that review to protect devolved authority and parental rights.",
    "Brexit is already shaping the fee\u2011and\u2011access plans that Welsh higher\u2011education institutions must submit for 2019\u201120.  The plans are built on forecasts of student enrolments and fee income; a fall in EU\u2011domiciled applicants \u2013 an 8\u202f% drop for Welsh universities versus a 2\u202f% rise in England \u2013 reduces the projected fee revenue that many institutions had counted on.  Five universities explicitly reference Brexit in their draft plans and flag the need to adjust fee\u2011income assumptions if the EU\u2011student pipeline continues to shrink.  In response, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) runs a dedicated Brexit\u2011working group, receives quarterly forecasts from institutions, and tests a range of scenarios (including reduced EU research funding and mobility).  HEFCW\u2019s executives challenge any institution whose forecasts appear out\u2011of\u2011step, require evidence\u2011based assumptions and, where necessary, approve amendments to fee\u2011and\u2011access plans.  Student protection is reinforced through a memorandum of understanding with NUS Wales, mandatory student charters and quality\u2011code provisions that obligate providers to safeguard students if courses close or funding gaps emerge.\n\nThe committee also examined domestic PPE production.  Novo\u202fTextiles has re\u2011tooled its plant to supply surgical masks and is preparing to make Canadian\u2011designed N95 respirators; a contract with Medicom in Montreal secures additional N95 capacity, and a separate agreement with General Motors delivers surgical\u2011mask output.  Ministers confirmed that 101.3\u202fmillion surgical masks have already been distributed to provinces and that 24 domestic contracts are in place, underscoring a commitment to expand UK\u2011based production.\n\nRegarding Canadian infrastructure, Liberal MP Luc\u202fBerthold asked how many projects are still pending provincial approval.  Infrastructure Minister Catherine\u202fMcKenna replied that \u201chundreds of projects have been approved in recent weeks\u201d but did not provide a precise tally.  She affirmed ongoing virtual meetings with provinces and a focus on clearing the backlog to enable a swift summer construction season.",
    "**Key points on the middle\u2011tier role and on government support for seniors and other vulnerable Canadians**\n\n1. **Middle\u2011tier coordination (Canada)**  \n   * The parliamentary record does not contain a detailed discussion of a formal \u201cmiddle\u2011tier\u201d in the Canadian social\u2011service system.  What does emerge, however, is a clear emphasis on **multi\u2011agency and regional collaboration** to reach vulnerable groups.  Examples include:  \n   *\u202fJoint work between the **federal government, provinces/territories and municipal authorities** on long\u2011term\u2011care standards, housing for seniors and the New\u202fHorizons for Seniors programme.  \n   *\u202fThe **strategic delivery group** (mentioned in the Welsh context) is mirrored in Canada by inter\u2011governmental working groups that map out responsibilities across federal, provincial and local levels, ensuring that services such as home\u2011care, health\u2011care and income\u2011support are not duplicated and that gaps are identified early.  \n\n2. **Direct financial assistance for seniors**  \n   * A **one\u2011time, tax\u2011free payment of up to\u202f$500** was announced for the most vulnerable seniors \u2013\u202f$300 for those receiving Old Age Security (OAS) and an additional $200 for those receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).  \n   * The **GST credit** has been expanded to help low\u2011income seniors with everyday expenses.  \n   * **$20\u202fmillion** has been earmarked to expand the **New\u202fHorizons for Seniors** program, which funds community\u2011based services such as grocery\u2011delivery, digital\u2011connectivity and social\u2011isolation mitigation.  \n\n3. **Broader safety\u2011net measures that affect vulnerable Canadians**  \n   * **Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)** and related income\u2011support programmes were designed to keep Canadians, including low\u2011income seniors and those with disabilities, afloat during the pandemic.  Adjustments were made to the earnings\u2011threshold rules to avoid penalising recipients who take a small amount of work.  \n   * **Universal pharmacare** remains a priority in the government\u2019s recovery agenda, with the goal of ensuring that all Canadians\u2014including seniors and people with chronic conditions\u2014have reliable access to medicines regardless of employment status.  \n   * **Long\u2011term\u2011care reform**: the government has committed to stronger national standards, federal funding tied to compliance, and increased oversight to protect residents of both public and private facilities.  This is aimed at the most at\u2011risk elderly population, who have borne the brunt of COVID\u201119 mortality.  \n\n4. **Targeted programmes for other vulnerable groups**  \n   * **Indigenous seniors and remote\u2011community elders** are receiving additional outreach funding and culturally appropriate health services through Indigenous Services Canada.  \n   * **Homeless and low\u2011income seniors** are supported by a **$300\u202fmillion** investment in the national housing strategy, which includes emergency shelter upgrades, rapid\u2011rehousing and rental\u2011assistance measures.  \n   * **Looked\u2011after children and youth** (a parallel vulnerable group) are receiving new funding for virtual\u2011school pilots and coordinated case\u2011management, illustrating the same multi\u2011agency approach applied to other at\u2011risk populations.  \n\n5. **Accountability and data\u2011driven oversight**  \n   * The government stresses the importance of **transparent data collection** on senior outcomes (e.g., health\u2011service utilisation, housing stability, and income\u2011support uptake) to guide policy adjustments.  \n   * Provincial and territorial ministries are required to **report on the implementation of senior\u2011support measures**, ensuring that the federal\u2011level funding is used effectively and that service gaps are identified early.  \n\n**Bottom line:** While the Canadian transcript does not label a specific \u201cmiddle tier,\u201d the overarching theme is coordinated, multi\u2011level governance that brings together federal, provincial, municipal and community partners to deliver targeted financial aid, health\u2011care access and long\u2011term\u2011care reforms for seniors and other vulnerable Canadians.  Direct cash payments, expanded tax credits, dedicated program funding (New\u202fHorizons, universal pharmacare, housing) and stronger oversight mechanisms together form the core of the government\u2019s support strategy.",
    "The marketing expert frames the remote\u2011control project as a \u201cbrand\u2011able\u201d device that must be instantly recognizable and personally meaningful to each user.\u202fHe stresses that the product\u2019s success will hinge on three pillars: a striking, \u201cfancy\u201d look that users can identify with; novel technology that creates conversation value; and enough practical utility to keep the device in use.\u202fTo that end, he pushes for features that enable user identification\u2014speaker\u2011dependent speech\u2011recognition and a \u201cwho\u2011is\u2011using\u2011it\u201d sensor that could log favorite channels, volume habits, and even restrict access for certain users (e.g., a child).\u202fHe sees this as a powerful sales hook: a remote that not only knows the house but knows the person, allowing personalized shortcuts and a sense of ownership that differentiates the product from generic competitors.\n\nFrom a market positioning standpoint, he argues for a premium\u2011niche approach rather than a low\u2011margin mass market, targeting a price band of \u20ac35\u2011\u20ac50 and emphasizing a lifetime guarantee to reinforce perceived quality and reliability.\u202fHe also stresses that the product should be environmentally sensitive, ergonomic, and durable, with a simple button layout complemented by a small LCD display for feedback.\u202fFinally, he suggests the design be upgradable\u2014modular hardware or firmware that can add future features without replacing the whole unit\u2014so the brand can evolve while retaining its identifiable identity. In short, the marketing view is that user identification is both a functional advantage and a branding opportunity, and the remote must combine eye\u2011catching design, cutting\u2011edge tech, and dependable performance to command a premium price.",
    "The committee\u2019s post\u2011legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act\u202f2015 focused on three inter\u2011linked themes \u2013 the prospect of universal adoption of the regime, the benefits the Act has delivered, and the shortcomings that will need to be remedied in the forthcoming PCET Bill.\n\n**Universal adoption**  \nMinister Kirsty\u202fWilliams stressed that the government intends the 2015 Act to be \u201cthe norm\u201d for all Welsh tertiary providers \u2013 a universal framework that guarantees every institution can be held to the same regulatory standards while preserving institutional autonomy.  She noted that, although the Act was not originally drafted to be future\u2011proof, the aim now is to extend its reach so that every university, college and the very small number of private providers are able to operate under a common set of expectations.  The Minister also warned that any universal roll\u2011out must be accompanied by sufficient professional\u2011learning funding to ensure schools and colleges can deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate and related outcomes to a high standard.\n\n**Advantages**  \nThe Act introduced a clear four\u2011point strategic purpose \u2013 regulation of Welsh institutions, protection of public\u2011funded value, fair access and the safeguarding of autonomy.  It gave the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) new powers of intervention, sanctions and outcome\u2011based monitoring, enabling the government to influence national priorities through the annual remit letter (e.g., living\u2011wage commitments, ethical procurement, mental\u2011health initiatives).  The legislation also provided a proportional regulatory model: public\u2011funded universities are tightly regulated, while the few private providers are assessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, protecting quality without stifling innovation.  Early data on student\u2011finance reforms showed marked increases in postgraduate, part\u2011time and disadvantaged\u2011student participation, suggesting the Act has helped broaden access.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nCommittee members identified several gaps.  The Act does not embed national outcome targets in law, leaving the government to rely on the remit letter rather than statutory obligations.  Fee\u2011and\u2011access plans remain input\u2011focused, bureaucratic and limited to a one\u2011year horizon, reducing their strategic impact.  Governance provisions are indirect; the Act does not directly address poor governance, relying instead on existing HEFCW assurance processes.  HEFCW\u2019s intervention powers were described as \u201ccumbersome\u201d and lacking a graduated scale, making swift, proportionate action difficult.  Finally, the legislation was not designed for the growing diversity of providers (e.g., private or work\u2011based learners) and therefore needs to be updated to future\u2011proof the sector.\n\nIn sum, while the 2015 Act has created a useful regulatory backbone and facilitated wider participation, the committee concluded that its lack of statutory outcome mechanisms, limited governance tools and insufficient flexibility for emerging provider models constitute the principal weaknesses that the new PCET legislation must address.",
    "The group\u2019s evaluation\u2011criteria segment began with Cat outlining the rubric that would be used to judge the remote\u2011control concept. The rubric consisted of a series of binary or Likert\u2011style statements (e.g., \u201cthe design is unique,\u201d \u201cit is functional,\u201d \u201cthe material is spongy,\u201d \u201cit integrates fruit/vegetable motifs,\u201d \u201cthe ergonomics match user behaviour,\u201d \u201cit is easy to lose,\u201d \u201cthe design is simple,\u201d \u201cit is fashionable,\u201d and \u201cit meets the target demographic\u201d). Each participant was asked to assign a score from\u202f1\u202f(to\u202fstrongly agree) to\u202f7\u202f(to\u202fstrongly disagree), after which the scores would be averaged to produce a single quantitative rating for each criterion.\n\nDuring the scoring, the team quickly identified points of consensus and divergence. All agreed the remote was highly unique (most gave a\u202f1\u202for\u202f2) and functional (mostly\u202f1\u20112). The spongy\u2011rubber feel also received a strong endorsement (mostly\u202f1). The fruit\u2011/vegetable theme was viewed positively but with mixed intensity, yielding scores around\u202f3\u20114. Ergonomic fit for the majority right\u2011handed user was acceptable (scores\u202f2\u20113), though concerns were raised about left\u2011handed usability, resulting in a slightly higher (worse) rating. The risk of loss was debated; some felt the bright colour mitigated loss (score\u202f4), others thought it remained easy to misplace (scores\u202f5\u20116). Simplicity and fashionability were both rated moderately well (\u2248\u202f2\u20113), while the appeal to the intended young\u2011trend\u2011setter demographic received a mixed response (\u2248\u202f4\u20115).\n\nAfter tabulating the numbers, the average across all criteria settled around\u202f6.5\u202fon the 1\u20117 scale, indicating the design met most expectations but still had notable weaknesses\u2014especially in loss\u2011prevention, left\u2011handed ergonomics, and cost\u2011fit. The team agreed the rubric was useful but needed clearer definitions and possibly weighted categories for future assessments.",
    "**Using CDs for backup** \u2013 The group agreed that CDs are not a reliable long\u2011term storage medium.  Burned CD\u2011ROMs tend to deteriorate after a few years, and the write\u2011once/\u200bread\u2011once nature makes them unsuitable as the sole archive.  While CD\u2011ROMs are still useful for public distribution (e.g., LDC releases), the team favoured a more robust strategy: keep a master copy on a non\u2011backed\u2011up disk, archive it on high\u2011capacity tape (or a dedicated tape robot), and supplement with additional media only when needed.  The consensus was to treat CDs as a convenience layer rather than a primary backup.\n\n**Probability computation** \u2013 The discussion centred on how to populate the conditional tables of the belief\u2011net that will decide between \u201cVista\u201d, \u201cEnter\u201d and \u201cTango\u201d intentions.  An initial na\u00efve approach \u2013 counting votes and dividing by the total \u2013 was dismissed as too symmetric; it assumes equal weight for every expert node.  Participants advocated a weighted\u2011average scheme, where each expert\u2019s contribution is multiplied by a learned weight that sums to one.  For situations where expert reliability varies, a \u201cmixture\u2011of\u2011experts\u201d hidden node (H) was proposed to select or blend the appropriate weighting dynamically.  The group stressed that the weights must be derived from data (e.g., the digit\u2011string corpus) and that the hidden node should be trained rather than hand\u2011coded.\n\n**Experimental setup of the computer\u2011navigation system** \u2013 The prototype will use a portable PDA placed on a meeting table to record interactions, with both high\u2011quality close\u2011talk microphones (ground\u2011truth audio) and far\u2011field pressure\u2011zone microphones (acoustic research).  Digit\u2011string recordings will serve as a controlled baseline.  The system will simulate a \u201cwizard\u201d computer that can fail mid\u2011session, allowing the collection of both human\u2011computer and human\u2011human dialogues.  Contextual information (GPS location, user intent modes \u2013 Vista, Enter, Tango) will be logged, and all channels will be synchronously recorded for later beam\u2011forming experiments.  Consent forms will be signed, transcripts anonymised, and the corpus released through the LDC for broader research use.",
    "The team rejected the idea of placing identical button groups on both sides of the remote because they felt it would undermine the \u201cease\u2011of\u2011use\u201d they were targeting for seniors aged 60\u201180.\u202fDuring the discussion the Project Manager noted that adding channel\u2011up/down and volume\u2011up/down controls on each side \u201cwould certainly yield great options for the design,\u201d but the User\u2011Interface lead quickly countered that \u201cease of use will be a lot more difficult\u201d if the layout is duplicated.\u202fThe consensus was that a single, well\u2011defined side \u2013 with the power button and channel controls positioned where the thumb naturally rests \u2013 would be simpler for the primary user group and would avoid confusing users who might otherwise have to decide which side to operate.\n\nWhen the Project Manager later suggested producing a right\u2011handed and a left\u2011handed version of the remote, the reaction was mixed but generally positive.\u202fThe User\u2011Interface engineer joked that \u201cif we build rocket ships why can\u2019t we build left\u2011handed and right\u2011handed remotes,\u201d and the Marketing representative raised the practical question of families needing two separate units.\u202fIndustrial\u2011Design and Marketing both acknowledged that it was feasible and could be marketed as a differentiator, while the Project Manager called the idea \u201cgreat.\u201d\u202fOverall, the team did not see the dual\u2011handed versions as a blocker; they viewed it as an optional extension that could be pursued without compromising the core design, provided it did not add undue complexity or cost.",
    "The team spent most of the meeting trying to bring the remote\u2011control\u2019s bill\u2011of\u2011materials down to the \u20ac12.5 ceiling that the finance department set as the maximum viable cost.  The consensus was that the most expensive, low\u2011value items had to be eliminated first.  Both the solar\u2011cell power source and the voice\u2011recognition module were identified as \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d features that could not be justified at the target price; dropping voice recognition alone saved enough to stay under budget.  The special\u2011colour finish and the double\u2011curved, titanium\u2011style housing were also scrapped because they added material cost and tooling complexity without delivering a proportional market benefit.\n\n  To keep the product attractive while still cutting cost, the group agreed on a modular\u2011cover approach.  The base unit would be built with a simple plastic shell and standard\u2011colour (black/grey) buttons, which are cheap and durable.  Optional rubber \u201cspongy\u201d covers could be sold separately for customers who want the premium feel, allowing the core design to stay inexpensive while still offering a customization path.  The LCD display, although relatively pricey, was retained because the team judged it more valuable to the user experience than the voice\u2011recognition feature.\n\n  In short, cost reduction was achieved by abandoning solar cells, voice\u2011recognition, special colour, and the premium curved titanium case, and by switching the primary housing material to plastic.  The remaining design\u2014basic plastic shell, standard buttons, and an LCD screen\u2014fits the \u20ac12.5 target, with optional add\u2011on covers providing a revenue\u2011boosting customization option without inflating the base production cost.",
    "**Pros of voice\u2011recognition that emerged in the discussion**\n\n1. **Market appeal and differentiation** \u2013 Several participants noted that voice control is seen as a \u201chigh\u2011tech\u201d feature that can make the remote feel modern and fashionable, giving it a clear selling point in a crowded market.  \n2. **User\u2011friendly / intuitive** \u2013 The marketing data presented showed that a sizable portion of respondents would pay extra for a remote that feels \u201cmore intuitive,\u201d and voice commands were identified as a way to simplify operation, especially for basic functions such as power, channel selection and volume.  \n3. **Accessibility** \u2013 The group highlighted that voice activation could be an advantage for users with physical disabilities, expanding the product\u2019s appeal beyond the typical \u201cyoung professional\u201d segment.  \n4. **Willingness to pay** \u2013 Survey results indicated that 15\u201135\u2011year\u2011old consumers were prepared to spend an additional \u20ac15\u201135 for a remote that includes speech recognition, suggesting a potential revenue boost if the feature is delivered well.  \n\n**Cons of voice\u2011recognition that were raised**\n\n1. **Cost and complexity** \u2013 Implementing a reliable microphone, processing unit and associated firmware would increase the bill of materials and overall development effort, potentially pushing the product out of the desired price band.  \n2. **Technical maturity** \u2013 One user recounted a real\u2011world experience where the voice system performed poorly, requiring the user to shout for extended periods. The consensus was that the technology still needs refinement before it can be a core feature.  \n3. **Power consumption** \u2013 Adding a constantly\u2011listening microphone and signal\u2011processing circuitry would draw more power, raising concerns about battery life or the need for a rechargeable solution.  \n4. **Impact on time\u2011to\u2011market** \u2013 The project manager warned that any added complexity could delay launch, contradicting the new requirement to keep the remote simple and focused solely on TV control.  \n5. **Usability trade\u2011offs** \u2013 There was debate about whether voice should be an always\u2011on function or a toggle, and whether it might distract from the primary, tactile controls that users already expect.  \n\nIn summary, the team saw voice recognition as a potentially compelling, market\u2011driven differentiator that could improve accessibility and justify a higher price, but they were also mindful of the current technology\u2019s reliability, cost, power, and schedule implications. The group leaned toward treating it as an optional, carefully scoped feature rather than a mandatory core function.",
    "The industrial designer opened the battery discussion by stating the remote must have a **long\u2011life power source that does not dominate the shape**.  The general requirement is a cell that can stay in the remote for weeks of intermittent use, draws very little current, and can be placed in a thin, ergonomically\u2011curved housing.  \n\n**Benefits and drawbacks of the common options** were weighed.  AA cells are cheap, widely stocked and give the longest run\u2011time, but their diameter forces the remote to be bulky.  AAA cells are smaller and would let the handset be slimmer, yet they hold far less capacity and would need replacement far more often.  Small lithium\u2011ion packs were mentioned as a \u201cwatch\u2011type\u201d rechargeable cell; they would meet the size goal but the cost and the need for a dedicated charging circuit were flagged as potential budget overruns.  The team also explored kinetic (dynamo) and solar harvesters.  Both are attractive because they eliminate user\u2011replaced batteries, but the kinetic unit would require a protruding wind\u2011up mechanism that adds volume, and solar panels would need a relatively large surface area and are not robust enough for the drops a remote typically endures.  \n\nTo **conserve battery life**, the designer proposed a standby mode that powers down any back\u2011lighting after 5\u201310\u202fseconds of inactivity and keeps the infrared transmitter in a low\u2011draw state when not in use.  This approach reduces the average current draw to a few microwatts, extending the life of any chosen cell.  \n\nAfter reviewing cost, availability, and form\u2011factor, the group **settled on standard AA/AAA cells** for the consumer version, accepting the modest size penalty in exchange for low price and easy replacement.  For the **industrial\u2011working design**, however, the industrial designer recommended a **rechargeable charger station** rather than a replaceable battery.  In a professional environment the remote is likely to be used continuously, and frequent battery swaps would cause downtime and waste.  A dock\u2011type charger attached to the TV or workbench guarantees that the remote is always topped up, eliminates the need for users to keep spare cells on hand, and aligns with the design goal of a reliable, low\u2011maintenance power source.",
    "The team decided to turn the project into a conference paper for several practical and strategic reasons. First, they wanted a **formal record of what had been built**\u2014the Bayes\u2011net architecture, the \u201cwhere\u2011is\u2011X\u201d construction handling, and the integration of ontology\u2011driven discourse cues. By documenting these components, they could preserve the work for future reference and avoid losing the details of the many ad\u2011hoc experiments they had already run.\n\nSecond, the **interdisciplinary nature of the venue** (a conference that blends cognitive, neural, psycholinguistic, and NLP perspectives) made the project a good fit. The paper could showcase how a traditionally \u201cAI\u2011only\u201d system now incorporates cognitive\u2011linguistic motivations, neuro\u2011biologically plausible representations, and a probabilistic decision\u2011making model, thereby appealing to the broad audience the conference attracts.\n\nThird, the group saw the paper as a **means to obtain external feedback and validation**. Presenting a concise, four\u2011 to six\u2011page description would let peers critique the novelty of treating \u201cwhere\u2011is\u2011X\u201d questions as both location\u2011 and path\u2011requests, the use of intention generation, and the self\u2011questioning architecture. Even a rejected submission would provide valuable reviewer comments to steer further development.\n\nFourth, the upcoming return of their manager (Wolfgang Walster) and the need to **demonstrate progress to senior leadership** created pressure to have something tangible to show. A conference paper serves as a visible deliverable that signals the project\u2019s seriousness and justifies continued funding and staffing.\n\nFinally, the team recognized the **career\u2011development benefit** of having a publication on a reputable interdisciplinary venue, which can strengthen individual CVs and the group\u2019s reputation within the SmartKom community. All these factors combined to motivate the inclusion of the project in a conference paper.",
    "Kirsty\u202fWilliams made it clear that the \u00a35\u202fmillion earmarked for the regional consortia is not a blanket grant but a pool that is passed straight to schools via the consortia.  She said the money \u201cgoes via the consortia to schools\u201d and that any school which identifies a professional\u2011learning need for the Welsh Baccalaureate should be able to spend the funding on that purpose.  She stressed that the government will not \u201csecond\u2011guess\u201d individual school decisions but expects the consortia and head\u2011teachers to allocate the money where it will improve delivery of the qualification.\n\nWhen the committee raised worries about university governance, Williams replied that the issue is being tackled head\u2011on.  She noted an independent Gillian\u202fCamm review commissioned jointly by Universities Wales and HEFCW, and said she now meets chairs one\u2011to\u2011one to challenge them on governance standards.  She confirmed that the forthcoming tertiary\u2011education bill will contain a regulatory condition on good governance and that the government is keen to improve board diversity and embed stronger outcome\u2011agreement mechanisms.\n\nOn university mergers she described the government\u2019s stance as \u201cagnostic\u201d.  She said there is no policy drive to force re\u2011configurations, but that if an institution can demonstrate a clear benefit for students a merger would be welcomed.  She cited the past Cardiff\u202fMet\u2011University\u202fof\u202fGlamorgan merger debate as an example of a decision that was left to the institutions themselves.\n\nFinally, the group discussed a dip in university admissions \u2013 especially the fall in EU enrolments after the tuition\u2011fee grant was removed \u2013 and how to reverse it.  Williams pointed to the Diamond reforms, extra funding for Global\u202fWales marketing, a \u00a35\u202fmillion boost for postgraduate support and a \u00a35\u202fmillion package for part\u2011time study, and stressed that outcome\u2011based \u201cfee\u2011and\u2011access\u201d plans and multi\u2011year funding settlements will be used to stabilise recruitment.  She said the government is working closely with Universities Wales and HEFCW to monitor admissions, adjust fee structures and improve student\u2011support packages to restore confidence in Welsh higher education.",
    "**Energy\u2011source decision**  \nThe team examined three power options \u2013 disposable batteries, solar cells and kinetic/hand\u2011dynamo charging. After weighing weight, size and cost, they rejected solar (incompatible with the soft\u2011rubber cover) and the hand\u2011dynamo (still untested). The consensus was to use a rechargeable lithium cell as the primary source, supplemented by a kinetic\u2011energy harvesting mechanism that recharges the battery when the remote is shaken or moved. This hybrid solution satisfies the \u201cno\u2011wires\u201d requirement while keeping the unit compact and affordable.\n\n**Technological innovation**  \nInnovation was anchored in three areas:  \n\n1. **Kinetic power** \u2013 the new energy\u2011harvest module is the only novel hardware element that will be integrated into the production model.  \n2. **Ergonomic double\u2011curved housing** \u2013 a hand\u2011shaped plastic shell with a soft\u2011latex overlay, large tactile buttons and side\u2011scroll wheels, allowing operation by feel in low\u2011light conditions.  \n3. **Selective voice\u2011enabled locator** \u2013 a limited voice\u2011recognition chip was prototyped for \u201cfind\u2011my\u2011remote\u201d functionality, but full voice\u2011controlled channel changing was dropped as too complex and costly.  \n\nLED\u2011backlit buttons, replaceable fruit\u2011pattern latex skins and a bright yellow logo strip were added for visual appeal, but were not treated as core innovations.\n\n**Overall evaluation**  \nUsing a seven\u2011point rubric the team rated the prototype low on ease\u2011of\u2011use (\u22482) and fashionability (\u22482) because the clay model still needed refinement. Technological novelty received a moderate score (3\u20114) \u2013 kinetic charging and the locator were seen as genuine advances, while other features were deemed incremental. On \u201cuniqueness/marketability\u201d the remote scored high (\u22481\u20112), and on \u201crisk of loss\u201d it scored low (\u22487) thanks to the bright locator strip. The cost analysis confirmed the design stays under the \u20ac12.5\u202fk budget, and the group agreed the remote is ready for a production run, with a plan to later offer left\u2011handed variants and higher\u2011end titanium finishes.",
    "The team\u2019s conversation broke into four clear strands:\n\n**Technical issues** \u2013 The group spent most of the time weighing functionality against cost.  A rubber, double\u2011curved case was chosen for its ergonomic feel and anti\u2011RSI benefits, but that decision forced the use of rubber push\u2011buttons and ruled out a metal or titanium shell.  They agreed on a **simple\u2011button layout** (power, channel\u202f\u00b1, volume\u202f\u00b1, numeric keypad) and rejected a high\u2011end LCD, chip\u2011on\u2011print or voice\u2011recognition module because those would raise the bill of materials and complicate the board.  The remote will not include a display, scrolling wheel or fancy scroll\u2011wheel; instead it will rely on a straightforward IR transmitter and a few mechanical keys.  The team also discussed adding a lock\u2011button to prevent accidental presses, but kept the overall design minimal to stay within the \u20ac12.50 cost ceiling.\n\n**Energy source** \u2013 Several power options were evaluated.  A conventional disposable battery remains the baseline, but the designers explored **kinetic harvesting** (a hand\u2011dynamo or squeeze\u2011generated generator built into the rubber case) and **solar cells**.  Solar was dismissed as unreliable indoors, while kinetic energy was liked because the rubber case could be \u201csqueezed\u201d to recharge the battery.  A low\u2011cost charging cradle was also mentioned as a possible supplemental solution.\n\n**Project\u2011announcement email** \u2013 At the end of the meeting the project manager confirmed that each discipline would receive a follow\u2011up email outlining next steps: the industrial designer would start the physical case design, the UI designer would flesh out the button layout and circuitry, and marketing would draft the launch communication.  The email will also contain the finalized task list and deadlines.\n\n**Sample sensor** \u2013 A newly\u2011developed sensor/speaker prototype was brought up.  The team noted that it would be the **most expensive component** and offered limited functional value for a TV remote.  While it could enable speech\u2011recognition or feedback tones, the consensus was that the cost\u2011benefit ratio was poor and the feature would not be integrated into the first\u2011generation product.  It may be revisited in later versions if the budget permits.",
    "The most recent meeting was a detailed\u2011design review of the prototype remote\u2011control. The team confirmed that the basic ergonomic layout \u2013 a double\u2011curved, rubber\u2011coated body with thumb\u2011powered power, finger\u2011assigned channel and volume controls, a lock button, and a numeric keypad \u2013 meets the original functional goals. The new kinetic\u2011energy/solar\u2011cell power source and the voice\u2011recognition module were highlighted as the primary technological differentiators, although their cost and reliability raised concerns.  \n\nKey problems surfaced:  \n\n1. **Budget pressure** \u2013 The target price of \u20ac12.50 per unit is being exceeded (current estimate \u20ac11.99 without the solar cell, but overall still above budget). Removing the solar cell or backup battery would bring costs down, but would also strip away the \u201cenvironmental\u201d selling point.  \n\n2. **Left\u2011handed vs. right\u2011handed design** \u2013 The current prototype is right\u2011handed only; the team debated producing a mirrored version to avoid alienating left\u2011handed users.  \n\n3. **Component complexity** \u2013 Voice\u2011recognition and the kinetic power system require sophisticated chips and sensors, increasing both cost and development risk. The team questioned whether a simpler infrared\u2011only solution might suffice.  \n\n4. **Material choices** \u2013 Rubber housing provides durability and a \u201cspongy\u201d feel, but the feasibility of alternative finishes (cloth, wood\u2011like panels) and colour options remains unresolved.  \n\n5. **Usability issues** \u2013 Concerns about losing the remote led to proposals for a beep/light locator, but the sensor design and activation method (clap, voice, darkness) need refinement.  \n\nOverall, the prototype is functional and aesthetically distinct, but the group must decide whether to keep the solar\u2011cell/voice\u2011recognition features or sacrifice them for cost, and whether to develop a left\u2011handed version before moving to final production.",
    "Hefin\u202fDavid\u202fAM and Minister\u202fHuw\u202fIrranca\u2011Davies both flagged a set of inter\u2011linked worries about the \u00a34.50\u2011per\u2011hour childcare rate and the broader scheme.  \n\n**Fee and access\u2011plan design** \u2013 David warned that the current fee\u2011and\u2011access\u2011plan process is overly bureaucratic, requiring parents to supply wage slips, birth certificates and other paperwork for each pilot area. He argued that this administrative load discourages the lowest\u2011income families the policy is meant to help and risks creating a \u201cpaper\u2011only\u201d barrier to access.  \n\n**Affordability for the poorest working families** \u2013 Both speakers stressed that the \u00a34.50 rate must remain truly affordable. David questioned whether extra charges for food, snacks, transport or consumables (up to \u00a37.50 a day) would erode the benefit for low\u2011paid households, effectively creating an \u201cEasyJet\u2011style\u201d service where richer parents can top up while the most vulnerable are left with a reduced offering. Irranca\u2011Davies replied that the rate has been welcomed and is higher than the English average, but he acknowledged that add\u2011ons could undermine affordability and that the government will monitor and, if necessary, adjust the rate after the pilots.  \n\n**Pilots in Cardiff and Newport** \u2013 David pointed out that the scheme has not yet been tested in higher\u2011cost areas such as Cardiff and Newport, where providers worry the \u00a34.50 may be insufficient to attract staff or cover higher rents. Irranca\u2011Davies agreed the pilots will soon move into those locales and that any evidence of a shortfall will trigger a review of the rate or a differentiated regional rate.  \n\n**Workforce qualification and quality** \u2013 Both men linked the fee level to staff pay and professional standards. David asked whether the \u00a34.50 could sustain a qualified, well\u2011trained workforce, especially as the government plans a 10\u2011year workforce\u2011development programme. Irranca\u2011Davies said the current rate appears to support quality provision in existing pilots, but stressed that the \u00a34.50 must be paired with the capital and training investment promised in the \u00a360\u202fmillion fund to avoid a decline in staff quality.  \n\nIn sum, David and Irranca\u2011Davies agree that the \u00a34.50 rate is a good starting point, but they demand streamlined access, protection against hidden extra costs, evidence from pilots in high\u2011cost areas, and a clear, funded pathway to maintain a qualified, high\u2011quality childcare workforce.",
    "The group spent most of the meeting reviewing PhD\u202fC\u2019s recent work on on\u2011line cepstral normalisation.  He is training two separate running means \u2013 one for speech frames and one for silence \u2013 and switching between them with the VAD probability.  He notes that the means for C\u20110 and C\u20111 differ far more than for the higher coefficients, and that C\u20111 behaves oddly when the background noise changes: the silence\u2011mean can drift to a different value, producing a \u201cstrange\u201d trajectory for that coefficient.  To counter this, PhD\u202fC tried three tricks: (1) an adaptive time\u2011constant that is short at the start of an utterance and then capped at a threshold; (2) a per\u2011band threshold that adds white\u2011noise 15\u202fdB below the utterance\u2011peak, which whitens the silent portions and makes the MFCC trajectories smoother; and (3) experimenting with different normalisation settings for each MFCC.  The added noise makes the clean\u2011and\u2011noisy MFCCs almost indistinguishable, but the word\u2011error rate is unchanged \u2013 neither better nor worse \u2013 confirming his suspicion that normalising C\u20111 brings little benefit, while C\u20110 remains the most critical coefficient.\n\nThe discussion then turned to phase normalisation.  Grad\u202fG reported two attempts: simple phase\u2011unwrapping (which degraded performance) and a more radical idea of operating directly on complex spectra and dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of the usual log\u2011subtraction.  He warned that scaling issues arise because the logarithm\u2019s Taylor expansion assumes values near one.  Professor\u202fB echoed the need for a systematic study, pointing out that the team has only explored a few ad\u2011hoc tricks and that any gain must be weighed against possible increases in insertion or deletion errors.  He also stressed that the current phase\u2011normalisation experiments have produced \u201cgarbage\u201d results, so further error\u2011type analysis is required before adopting a standard approach.\n\nRegarding qualifications, Professor\u202fB noted that graduate\u202fA is preparing for the upcoming quals in July and will run \u201ccheating\u201d experiments to gauge the usefulness of intermediate feature categories.  While PhD\u202fC did not comment on quals, the professor\u2019s overall stance is that both phase\u2011normalisation and the broader feature\u2011selection work need clearer, quantifiable evidence before they can be incorporated into the final system or used as part of the quals portfolio.",
    "The group spent a good portion of the meeting trying to pin down which linguistic cues should be made explicit in the transcription model and how those cues can be incorporated without exploding the model\u2019s complexity.  The consensus was that a small set of binary \u201chigh\u2011level\u201d variables\u2014sonorant, nasality, voicing, and a few similar articulatory properties\u2014are the most useful for distinguishing phones.  Rather than rely on hand\u2011crafted canonical mappings, the team suggested extracting these cues directly from the acoustic streams, treating each cue as a separate feature stream (e.g., one stream per frequency band or per low\u2011pass\u2011filtered version of the MFCCs).  This multi\u2011stream view mirrors Saul\u2019s earlier work, where each stream is processed by its own detector and the results are later combined.\n\nThe advantage of a Noisy\u2011OR (or its soft\u2011OR analogue) was highlighted as a way to fuse the independent streams.  A Noisy\u2011OR treats each cue as an independent cause of a higher\u2011level decision and approximates the logical \u201cOR\u201d by taking the maximum of the individual probabilities.  This yields a compact conditional\u2011probability table, avoids the combinatorial blow\u2011up of a full CPT, and can be learned with EM in the same way as the hidden variables that drive the phone labels.  Because the Noisy\u2011OR does not require hard truth\u2011marks for each cue, the model can be trained on the existing transcripts while still allowing the cues to influence the posterior probabilities.\n\nFinally, the team agreed to embed these binary cue variables into the transcription formalism as hidden nodes.  Their weights (the \u201csoft\u2011AND\u201d for conjunctions and the \u201csoft\u2011OR\u201d for disjunctions) will be estimated jointly with the acoustic model, giving a unified Bayesian network that captures both low\u2011level acoustic evidence and high\u2011level linguistic structure without manual labeling.",
    "The team spent a good portion of the meeting reviewing how the system will be shown in upcoming demos.  The consensus was to use the Transcriber interface as the visual front\u2011end, augmenting it with the prosodic displays that Don has been developing and with the THISL information\u2011retrieval tools.  By porting the Tcl/Tk front\u2011end to a Windows machine and merging the Snack\u2011based Transcriber with the THISL IR, the demo can let users type a keyword, see a hit list, and click to listen to the corresponding audio segment.  The demo will also illustrate speaker\u2011turn detection and, if time permits, a simple prosody waveform overlay.\n\nBackup strategy was another hot topic.  Because the meeting\u2011recording disks are near capacity, the group agreed to keep a small \u201cnon\u2011backed\u2011up\u201d pool for data that can be regenerated in under a day, while all other recordings will continue to be archived on the regular backup system.  Dave Johnson confirmed that manual NW\u2011archive copies are acceptable and that burning CD\u2011ROMs for backup is discouraged; instead the team will acquire a few extra high\u2011capacity disks and schedule periodic consolidation of older 9\u2011GB drives onto larger media.\n\nCollecting notes was revisited in the context of Switchboard\u2011style overlap analysis and the CrossPad/PDA note\u2011taking prototypes.  The discussion highlighted the difficulty of synchronising timestamps between the pen\u2011based notes and the audio stream, the overhead of maintaining the required infrastructure, and the limited uptake of the CrossPad.  The group leaned toward a lightweight approach: use a scribe to annotate important moments after the meeting (leveraging the already\u2011available transcripts) rather than insisting on live digital note\u2011taking.\n\nRegarding future scheduling, Professor\u202fB (the professor) recommended that meetings be kept short and focused, alternating the agenda every other week (e.g., one week on demo integration, the next on data\u2011management or analysis).  He also suggested limiting regular meetings to a small core group (two\u2011 to three\u2011person sessions) and holding separate, topic\u2011specific gatherings only when enough material warrants a deeper dive.  This alternating, bite\u2011sized schedule is intended to keep progress steady without over\u2011loading participants.",
    "The committee asked why the Welsh Government had abandoned the plan to run the childcare\u2011offer administration through HM\u202fRevenue & Customs (HMRC) and what problems had emerged.\u202f\u202fSian\u202fGwenllian highlighted that the original decision had been presented as a straightforward technical solution, yet the Minister\u2019s office later cited \u201cissues\u201d that forced a change of course.  \n\nJulie\u202fMorgan explained that the HMRC option was dropped for three inter\u2011linked reasons. First, the Welsh language standards required of the scheme proved difficult to embed in HMRC\u2019s IT systems. Special Welsh characters and the bilingual data\u2011handling rules would have forced HMRC to develop bespoke functionality that was not compatible with its existing platforms. Second, the cost estimates supplied by HMRC after the discovery phase were substantially higher than the figures originally set out in the regulatory\u2011impact assessment, raising serious value\u2011for\u2011money concerns. Third, using HMRC would have limited the flexibility needed to expand the offer to training, education and \u201con\u2011the\u2011cusp\u201d parents, because those groups would have to be processed through a central UK body rather than through the local Welsh authorities that are closer to families.  \n\nMorgan stressed that the work with HMRC was not wasted; it clarified the technical and financial constraints and confirmed that a locally\u2011run system would be cheaper, more adaptable and keep the investment within Wales. Consequently, the Government decided to retain administration with the eight pilot local authorities, providing a ring\u2011fenced grant (about \u00a32.5\u202fmillion) to cover the administrative function. This approach, she argued, offers greater control, respects Welsh\u2011language requirements and allows the system to evolve as policy priorities change.",
    "**Professor\u202fC\u2019s comment on the workshop** \u2013 He said the recent workshop was useful but reminded everyone not to over\u2011engineer the next steps: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get carried away with fancy tricks; we should start with something simple and see whether the basic energy\u2011based features already give us a signal.\u201d\n\n**Team feedback on the person in Grenada** \u2013 When the name of the researcher from Grenada came up (Jose\u202fCarlos\u202fSegura), the group treated it as a positive lead. Professor\u202fC noted, \u201cHe\u2019s the guy in Grenada; his work on the VTS model could be useful for us,\u201d and the team agreed to look at his results.\n\n**Required elements in the new form arrangement** \u2013 The consensus was that the new digit\u2011form must contain, at a minimum, **Name, Email, Date, Time**, and the **Native\u2011language/Region** fields. Professor\u202fC stressed that the \u201cName\u202f+\u202fEmail\u202f+\u202fTime\u201d trio is the core, while the \u201cProfessional\u2011use\u2011only\u201d line and the region field are optional but helpful for later analysis.\n\n**Suggested structure of the belief\u2011net** \u2013 The group sketched a three\u2011layer net:  \n\n1. **Observable feature nodes** (energy, pitch, harmonicity, duration, etc.).  \n2. **Intermediate hidden nodes** representing high\u2011level user states \u2013 e.g., *Tourist vs. Business vs. Errand* and *Hurry vs. Leisure*.  \n3. **Decision nodes** (Enter, View, Approach) that receive input from the hidden layer.  \n\nThey also mentioned \u201csituation\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d sub\u2011nodes that feed into the hidden layer, keeping the overall architecture modular.\n\n**Grad\u202fB\u2019s opinion on the belief\u2011net structure** \u2013 Grad\u202fB urged a **minimalist design**. He argued that the net should start with the basic energy\u2011based feature distribution and only add a middle layer if the data clearly demand it. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it simple first; extra layers will only complicate learning and inference,\u201d he concluded.",
    "Grad\u202fE\u2019s view was that the experiment was essentially a feasibility check on the mean\u2011log\u2011magnitude spectral\u2011subtraction front\u2011end that the SmartKom team is planning to adopt.  He set up three conditions \u2013 a 12\u2011second \u201cpast\u2011plus\u2011present\u201d mean, a 12\u2011second centred mean, and shorter windows (2,\u202f4,\u202f6\u202fs).  The 12\u2011second past\u2011plus\u2011present estimate gave the best numbers; the centred\u2011window version produced a tiny, but measurable, drop in performance.  When the subtraction window was reduced, word\u2011error\u2011rate rose modestly (typically <\u202f0.5\u202f% and at most \u22480.8\u202f%).  Even when the training and test windows were matched, the baseline error stayed around 9\u201310\u202f%.  Grad\u202fE concluded that the approach is promising \u2013 the degradation with shorter windows is small enough to be tolerable, and the technique could be deployed in an interactive system, provided the system can accumulate a few seconds of speech before the first utterance.\n\nGrad\u202fA\u2019s opinion focused on a different goal: estimating how much \u201ccheating\u201d \u2013 i.e., supplying perfect voicing information \u2013 would help intermediate phonetic\u2011category classifiers.  He proposed a set of phone\u2011recognition experiments in which the LNA posteriors for non\u2011voiced phones are forced to zero whenever the segment is known to be voiced.  The purpose is to quantify the relative contribution of voicing cues before his qualifying exams in July.  Grad\u202fA expressed confidence that the experiments would be completed in time for his quals and that the results would give a clear picture of the usefulness of perfect voicing knowledge for improving phone\u2011recognition accuracy.  In short, he was optimistic that the experiments would validate the hypothesis and provide actionable insight for the broader system.",
    "The UI designer consistently pushed for a remote that is simple, ergonomic and technologically forward.  She argued that the control should have **as few physical buttons as possible**, relying on an **LCD screen** to present the most\u2011used functions (power, channel\u2011up/down, volume\u2011up/down) while hiding rarely\u2011used menus behind scrollable screens.  The UI stressed that the device must feel comfortable in the hand, recommending a **rubbery, slightly soft\u2011touch case** (hard\u2011rubber or a softer latex) in the company\u2019s colour palette, with the corporate logo clearly displayed on the front.  \n\nRegarding the wireless link, the UI was confident that **radio\u2011frequency (RF) can be used without causing interference**.  She explained that the transmitter would be tuned to a **specific, legally\u2011allowed frequency band** and could embed a simple **identification code or \u201chand\u2011shaking\u201d protocol** so that only the paired TV responds, even if a neighbour\u2019s remote operates on the same band.  This approach would give the user the freedom to point the remote in any direction, unlike infrared.  \n\nWhen the budget surplus was raised, the UI saw an opportunity to **upgrade the LCD size and add speech\u2011recognition hardware** (a small microphone and the necessary firmware).  She argued that these enhancements would not jeopardize the \u20ac14.6\u202f\u20ac target because the extra \u20ac2 could be allocated to the larger display, a more robust RF module, and the speech\u2011recognition chip.  In the final decision, the team adopted the UI\u2019s concept: a **minimal\u2011button, rubber\u2011cased remote with an LCD screen, RF communication tuned to a safe frequency, and the extra budget earmarked for a bigger screen and speech\u2011recognition capability**.  This solution satisfies ergonomic concerns, avoids radio\u2011wave interference, and leverages the remaining funds to add high\u2011value features.",
    "The professor\u2019s view of noise in the speech\u2011recognition front\u2011end can be broken down into four points.\n\n**Effect of noise on speech frequencies** \u2013 He stresses that the modest high\u2011pass filter they already use (cut\u2011off \u2248\u202f20\u202fHz, with only a mild roll\u2011off up to about 100\u202fHz) does not appreciably attenuate any of the speech band, even the lowest voiced formants. The filter is deliberately gentle so that the spectral shape of speech remains intact; the only noticeable impact is the removal of the 5\u2011Hz hum that occasionally appears in distant\u2011mic recordings.\n\n**Adding noise and smoothing** \u2013 When a low\u2011frequency contaminant is present, the solution is not a sophisticated new algorithm but a simple digital filter. He notes that the 5\u2011Hz component can be eliminated with a straightforward FIR smoothing filter, avoiding the need for elaborate de\u2011reverberation or adaptive schemes. The filter is linear\u2011phase, so it does not introduce phase distortion, and its latency is kept low (a few milliseconds) by using a short FIR window rather than a long IIR cascade.\n\n**FIR versus IIR filters** \u2013 The team has been experimenting with FIR designs that mimic the frequency response of the existing LDA (low\u2011delay) IIR filters but with far less group\u2011delay. Although FIR filters lack the infinite\u2011impulse\u2011response flexibility, their linear\u2011phase property and predictable latency make them preferable for the real\u2011time PDA\u2011mic pipeline.\n\n**Dealing with additive noise** \u2013 For broader additive noise, the professor favors classic spectral\u2011subtraction combined with on\u2011line mean/variance normalization. He warns that na\u00efve subtraction can raise the variance of the residual (\u201cmusical noise\u201d), so the subtraction factor should be scaled by an SNR\u2011dependent gain and followed by variance normalization. He also recommends a modest high\u2011pass pre\u2011emphasis before feature extraction, and stresses that a good voice\u2011activity detector (VAD) should be run first to isolate non\u2011speech frames for noise estimation. In short, simple linear filtering, careful spectral subtraction, and proper VAD/normalization are sufficient; more exotic nonlinear or deep\u2011learning approaches are unnecessary for the current noise conditions.",
    "The team agreed that the remote\u2019s **primary object** is to be a simple, ergonomic controller for a television, with the possibility of limited extra\u2011device control (e.g., a CD player) but without turning it into a full\u2011blown universal remote.  The shape must fit comfortably in one hand, be usable by left\u2011 or right\u2011handed users, and be thin enough (\u22481.5\u202fcm) to sit easily on a coffee\u2011table or in a pocket.  A rubber\u2011over\u2011plastic shell was favoured for durability, with interchangeable colour\u2011coded covers (white/metallic for a neutral look, bright \u201cfruity\u201d caps for younger buyers).  A small LCD or touch\u2011screen panel was discussed as a way to reduce the number of physical buttons while still displaying the most\u2011used functions\u2014power, volume, channel up/down, numeric entry and a teletext shortcut.  The LCD would also serve as a mode indicator for any extra features.\n\nOn **function**, the consensus was to keep the core set (on/off, volume, channel selection, numeric keypad) and to expose a **\u201cfavourite\u2011channel\u201d** capability.  The UI designer proposed a scroll\u2011wheel\u2011like interface that could be programmed with a list of favourite channels; the user would press a \u201cprogramme\u201d button, enter the channel numbers, and then roll the wheel to cycle through the saved list.  This would be implemented either as a physical wheel or as a touch\u2011controlled scroll on the LCD, with a mode\u2011switch light (or back\u2011lit button) to indicate when the wheel is in \u201cfavourites\u201d mode.\n\nThe **kinetic function**\u2014using user motion to generate power\u2014was debated.  Proposals included a hand\u2011crank generator, a kinetic\u2011energy\u2011harvesting rubber bumper, or a solar panel.  Because the kinetic system would add roughly \u20ac1 per unit and complicate the design, the group voted to **drop the kinetic energy feature** in the first production run, opting instead for a conventional rechargeable battery and a docking\u2011station cradle for charging and locating the remote.  The kinetic idea was retained as a possible future upgrade if cost targets could be met.",
    "**Proposed demographic\u2011marketing design**\n\nThe team agreed to focus the remote\u2011control on a youthful, tech\u2011savvy segment (18\u201135\u202fyears) while also opening niche sub\u2011markets such as users with visual or mobility limitations.\u202fTo appeal to these groups the product will be offered in a range of interchangeable case finishes\u2014standard silver/black, natural\u2011wood tones, olive\u2011green and other \u201corganic\u201d colours\u2014so customers can pick a style that matches their d\u00e9cor.\u202fA modular, up\u2011gradable architecture (a base\u2011station button that can be swapped for a locator or extra function module) will let the device evolve with user needs, extending its lifespan and supporting the promised lifetime\u2011warranty.\u202fPricing is positioned at \u20ac30\u2011\u20ac50, targeting a premium\u2011but\u2011affordable niche rather than a mass\u2011market low\u2011price race.\n\n**Industrial Design\u202f\u2194\u202fMarketing agreement on appearance presentations**\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing converged on a visual language that blends durability with a premium feel.\u202fThe remote will combine a white\u2011plastic core with a rubber\u2011covered \u201cred\u201d (or colour\u2011coded) grip area, giving a tactile, drop\u2011resistant surface.\u202fBoth sides endorsed the use of silver/black as the baseline palette, while allowing optional colour skins for personalization.\u202fA slightly curved, double\u2011curved or \u201corganic\u201d silhouette was favoured over a flat, utilitarian shape, and the final presentation will showcase the non\u2011remote\u2011looking, sleek form\u2011factor together with the interchangeable casings.\n\n**Industrial Designer\u2019s marketing\u2011plan proposal**\n\nThe designer suggested a three\u2011tier plan: (1) launch the core remote with voice\u2011recognition (the most marketable feature given existing in\u2011house technology), (2) sell optional case skins and upgrade modules (locator, extra buttons) to generate recurring revenue, and (3) promote a lifetime\u2011guarantee to reinforce durability and brand trust.\u202fA price\u2011point of \u20ac35\u2011\u20ac50 was recommended to position the product as an exclusive, high\u2011value offering.\n\n**Marketing\u2019s view of the product\u2019s marketability**\n\nMarketing praised the voice\u2011recognition capability as the \u201cmost marketable\u201d differentiator, arguing it will attract early adopters and justify a premium price.\u202fThey also highlighted the ergonomic rubber grip, durable construction and customizable aesthetics as strong selling points, while rejecting the costly touch\u2011screen option in favour of the cheaper, ready\u2011to\u2011launch voice\u2011control solution.\u202fOverall, the team believes the design\u2019s blend of style, functionality and demographic targeting makes the remote highly marketable.",
    "**Grad\u202fG\u2019s view**\n\n*Capturing the subject\u2019s intention* \u2013 Grad\u202fG treats the idea of explicitly modelling a subject\u2019s intention as a necessary step for the new \u201chigh\u2011level task\u201d experiments. He notes that the current belief\u2011net design already contains an \u201cintention\u201d node and argues that keeping this node separate (rather than conflating it with concrete actions) will make the data easier to analyse. He therefore backs the proposal to refine the intention\u2011capture stage before the wizard\u2011human switch\u2011over.\n\n*MSG* \u2013 Grad\u202fG is intrigued by the MSG front\u2011end but does not see it as a short\u2011term solution. He repeats Professor\u202fD\u2019s comment that MSG has \u201cinteresting temporal properties\u201d and suggests that, while it may eventually improve robustness, the team should first settle on a solid baseline before investing heavily in MSG.\n\n*Pronouncing \u201czero\u201d* \u2013 When the group debates whether speakers should say the digit \u201cO\u201d or \u201czero\u201d, Grad\u202fG sides with the pragmatic approach: the transcription sheet should record a single symbol (the digit \u201c0\u201d) and speakers should be instructed to say \u201czero\u201d. He worries that allowing two pronunciations will add unnecessary variability to the training data.\n\n*Hiring Fey* \u2013 Grad\u202fG is strongly in favour of bringing Fey on board. He points out that she has already acted as the \u201cwizard\u201d for data\u2011collection, performed well in unscripted interactions, and therefore would be an ideal candidate for the new \u201cinstructor\u201d role that will guide subjects through the refined tasks.\n\n**The professor\u2019s view (Professor\u202fD)**\n\n*Capturing the subject\u2019s intention* \u2013 The professor agrees that a clear, numbered list of tasks (including an explicit \u201cintention\u201d node) will help subjects follow the protocol. He supports the idea of a separate \u201cintention\u201d variable in the belief\u2011net, noting that it should be a single node with values such as \u201ctour\u201d, \u201cbusiness\u201d, or \u201churried\u201d.\n\n*MSG* \u2013 Professor\u202fD is one of the strongest advocates for MSG. He describes it as \u201cthe most promising component\u201d because of its distinct temporal dynamics and believes that, once the other engineering work is finished, MSG should be integrated into the system as a core feature extractor.\n\n*Pronouncing \u201czero\u201d* \u2013 He acknowledges that both \u201cO\u201d and \u201czero\u201d are legitimate pronunciations, but for consistency in the database he recommends using the written form \u201c0\u201d (or \u201cOH\u201d) on the transcription sheets and instructing speakers to say \u201czero\u201d. He notes that this mirrors standard practice in digit\u2011recognition corpora.\n\n*Hiring Fey* \u2013 The professor praises Fey\u2019s performance as a wizard, saying she \u201cresponded nicely to unexpected questions\u201d and was \u201cmore present than expected\u201d. He endorses her hiring, arguing that her experience and reliability make her a valuable addition to the team, especially for the upcoming subject\u2011interaction experiments.",
    "The Industrial Designer\u2019s comments fell into three clear areas:\n\n**1. Appearance and overall look**  \nHe repeatedly stressed that the new remote must stay a low\u2011cost, mass\u2011produced item.\u202fHis mental picture was a simple, inexpensive plastic shell that could be placed in almost every household (\u201cone in every ten households\u201d).\u202fHe warned against over\u2011designing the case or adding too many colours, because any extra material or finishing work would push the unit above the \u20ac12\u2011\u20ac15 price ceiling.\u202fAt the same time he acknowledged the market data that 80\u202f% of users would pay more for a \u201cfancy\u201d looking remote, so he suggested a modest aesthetic upgrade \u2013 a sleek shape, a clean layout and a few bright accent colours \u2013 but nothing that would compromise the cheap\u2011to\u2011manufacture goal.\n\n**2. Speech\u2011recognition**  \nWhen the group raised the idea of voice control, the designer said he liked the concept (\u201cspeech recognition is a great idea\u201d) but doubted its feasibility within the budget.\u202fHe pointed out that adding a microphone, DSP and the necessary firmware would increase component cost and design complexity, and he was not sure a reliable voice\u2011assistant could be fitted into the limited space and power budget of a \u20ac12 remote.\u202fNevertheless, he proposed a low\u2011tech \u201cwhere is the remote?\u201d voice cue that could trigger a simple beep, noting that such a feature would be useful for children who frequently misplace the controller.\n\n**3. Bluetooth and other new technologies**  \nThe designer explained that today\u2019s remotes are almost universally infrared.\u202fTo introduce Bluetooth he would need the TV to support Bluetooth as well, which would mean extra hardware in both devices and a higher retail price.\u202fHe concluded that Bluetooth (or any radio\u2011frequency link) was \u201cnot possible within our budget\u201d and that the project should stick to infrared for the core functions.\u202fHe also dismissed other \u201cnew\u2011technology\u201d ideas (e.g., built\u2011in receivers for teletext, LCD screens) as unnecessary for a child\u2011focused remote, arguing that they would add cost without delivering essential value.\n\nIn short, the Industrial Designer favoured a simple, inexpensive, slightly stylised remote, was enthusiastic about speech\u2011recognition in principle but skeptical about its cost, and ruled out Bluetooth and other advanced wireless technologies as out\u2011of\u2011scope for the child\u2011oriented product.",
    "The committee heard three distinct strands of debate.\n\n**Priority of inspections** \u2013\u202fBoth Jassa\u202fScott and Janet\u202fFinch\u2011Saunders stressed that inspection work must remain a top priority.  Scott explained that, although regional consortia are not yet statutory bodies, Estyn still examines their contribution to school\u2011improvement during every local\u2011authority inspection and will soon take a thematic approach to judging how well consortia support the new curriculum.  Finch\u2011Saunders asked whether the consortia should be placed on a statutory footing and agreed with Scott that, until that happens, the focus should be on robust, regular inspection of the services they provide, especially in secondary schools where the risk of \u201cschools causing concern\u201d is greatest.  Their common conclusion was that the inspection agenda should continue to be foregrounded and that any future statutory change must preserve that emphasis.\n\n**Re\u2011opening the House of Commons and Canada\u2019s diplomatic posture** \u2013\u202fMembers pressed the government to restore full parliamentary powers, arguing that a fully\u2011functioning Commons is essential to Canada\u2019s democratic credibility abroad, particularly in relation to Hong\u202fKong and to the broader defence of liberal values.  The government replied that it is working to return to normal sittings as quickly as public\u2011health conditions allow, while continuing to voice strong support for Hong\u202fKong and to confront foreign\u2011state interference.\n\n**Allocation of funds and systematic racism** \u2013\u202fPrime Minister\u202fJustin\u202fTrudeau outlined the $14\u202fbillion federal\u2011provincial transfer that will fund health\u2011care, child\u2011care, housing and other pandemic\u2011recovery measures.  He said the money is intended to \u201cfuel a revolution in our national institutions,\u201d noting that systemic racism permeates the RCMP, health\u2011care and other public bodies and that the fund must be used to reshape those institutions, strengthen anti\u2011racism secretariats, collect disaggregated data and redirect resources toward community\u2011based services.  In short, Trudeau linked the emergency\u2011fund package to a broader agenda of institutional transformation to eradicate systemic discrimination.",
    "**Technical and functional design** \u2013 The team agreed that the remote must be a simple, hand\u2011held push\u2011button device with an on/off power button, a menu\u2011access tap, and four directional keys (up, down, left, right). An infrared emitter will sit at the \u201cstalk\u201d of the banana\u2011shaped concept, and a low\u2011cost diode will handle signal transmission. Battery insertion must be easy (a side hatch or rear compartment) and the unit may include a kinetic\u2011hand\u2011crank generator as a backup power source. A beeper/locator button and a lock\u2011out function were also discussed to prevent accidental presses. No speech\u2011recognition or internet connectivity is planned; the focus is on reliable, low\u2011tech operation.\n\n**Prototype presentation** \u2013 Two physical mock\u2011ups were shown: a spongy\u2011rubber \u201cbroccoli\u201d shell and a hard\u2011plastic \u201cbanana\u201d shell, both with interchangeable fruit\u2011themed covers (strawberry, broccoli, etc.). The rubber version offers a squishy, child\u2011friendly feel, while the plastic version provides rigidity and shock resistance. The prototypes demonstrated a single\u2011curve shape (banana) versus a flat or double\u2011curve alternative; participants preferred the single\u2011curve for ergonomics but noted that a flatter shape might improve grip.\n\n**Detailed design** \u2013 Materials were narrowed to a plastic core with optional rubber over\u2011mold for the exterior. The core will house the PCB, battery, and IR diode; the rubber layer will give the \u201cspongy\u201d tactile quality and allow interchangeable covers. Button caps will be molded rubber, colored bright yellow with black legends to match corporate branding. The overall dimensions must stay within a hand\u2011size envelope (\u2248\u202f8\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm) to satisfy the user\u2011interface team\u2019s hand\u2011holdability requirement.\n\n**Specific design requirements** \u2013  \n1. **Aesthetic trend** \u2013 fruit\u2011inspired, colorful, interchangeable shells to encourage collectors.  \n2. **Ergonomics** \u2013 single\u2011curve, thumb\u2011friendly shape, lightweight (<\u202f150\u202fg).  \n3. **Robustness** \u2013 shock\u2011resistant plastic core, optional waterproof sleeve for bathroom use.  \n4. **Cost** \u2013 target production cost \u2264\u202f12.5\u202f\u20ac (current estimate\u202f\u2248\u202f11.9\u202f\u20ac).  \n5. **Usability** \u2013 minimal button set, intuitive menu access, easy battery hatch, lock function, optional beeper for locating the remote.  \n\nThe group concluded that the design satisfies the project\u2019s \u201ctrendy, original, easy\u2011to\u2011use\u201d criteria while staying within budget, and the next step is to refine the chosen single\u2011curve, plastic\u2011plus\u2011rubber prototype for final evaluation.",
    "The team spent the meetings reviewing the entire lifecycle of the remote\u2011control project\u2014from concept through prototype evaluation and the planned production run.  \n\n**Process evaluation** \u2013 Participants agreed that the workflow was largely effective but occasionally fragmented.  The project manager set milestones and deadlines, while the industrial designer, user\u2011interface designer, and marketing lead each contributed to their specialty areas.  The group noted that the \u201chand\u2011held, squishy\u2011fruit\u201d concept was successfully translated into a functional prototype, but the evaluation stage revealed gaps (e.g., missing voice\u2011control integration, unclear curvature of the grip, and unfinished battery\u2011access design).  The team used a seven\u2011point rating system to score usability, fashionability, technological innovation, and \u201csquishy\u2011fruity\u201d feel; scores clustered around 2\u20134, indicating the prototype still needed refinement before final approval.\n\n**Work division** \u2013 Roles were loosely defined, which fostered creativity but also caused occasional overlap.  The industrial designer handled form, material selection, and interchangeable shells; the UI designer defined button layout, power\u2011switch placement, and user\u2011interaction flow; marketing supplied trend data, pricing targets (\u2248\u202f\u20ac25 retail, \u20ac12.5 max cost) and coordinated the evaluation criteria; the project manager oversaw schedule, cost spreadsheets, and decision\u2011making on batteries (lithium vs. AAA).  All members reported good collaboration, though some expressed frustration with the limited tooling (e.g., reliance on whiteboard and digital pens) and the need for clearer documentation.\n\n**Production plan** \u2013 A cost spreadsheet showed the projected bill\u2011of\u2011materials at \u20ac11.9, below the \u20ac12.5 ceiling, promising a healthy profit margin.  The plan calls for lithium cells to simplify battery replacement, a single\u2011curve ergonomic grip, and interchangeable fruit\u2011themed rubber shells that can be sold in sets of three\u2011five.  The team agreed to finalize the curvature, add a hatch for battery access, and confirm the voice\u2011recognition module before moving to tooling.  Once the prototype meets the seven\u2011point criteria, the next step will be tooling for mass production and a marketing launch targeting fashion\u2011forward tech consumers.",
    "The group closed the meeting by sketching a short\u2011term \u201croad\u2011map\u201d and a longer\u2011term research agenda.  In the short term they agreed to finish the current set of experiments, verify that the new HTK runs reproduce the baseline, and then decide which of the many feature\u2011network combinations (PLP, JRASTA, MSG, delta\u2011features, multi\u2011band MLPs, etc.) merit further testing.  The longer\u2011term direction is to address the two dominant weaknesses that have emerged: (1) the limited ability of the present\u2011size neural nets to model the large variability introduced by multilingual, multi\u2011task training, and (2) the mismatch between training and test conditions (language, noise, channel).  Proposed ideas include increasing network capacity, using articulatory or soft targets instead of hard phoneme labels, and exploring context\u2011dependent or regression\u2011style networks that preserve more information across tasks.\n\nPhD\u202fD explained the multilingual model results: networks trained on a single language (e.g., TI\u2011digits) perform best on that language; adding broad English data yields a modest error\u2011rate increase (\u22481.1\u202f\u00d7 baseline), while adding two or three additional languages raises it to \u22481.3\u20131.4\u202f\u00d7.  Excluding the task language from the multilingual set further degrades performance (\u224820\u202f% loss).  The key observation is that the error rise is driven more by the diversity of training data than by the language per se, suggesting that the current net size cannot absorb the extra variability.\n\nWhen PhD\u202fC raised the issue of using multiple languages, the professor emphasized that training on a broader language set does not automatically improve cross\u2011language testing; the gains are modest and depend on how similar the added languages are to the target.  The discussion concluded that more focused language\u2011specific data or better\u2011designed targets may be more effective than simply adding languages.\n\nFinally, the team debated the policy for releasing meeting transcripts.  They agreed to make the data publicly available on the predetermined release date (July\u202f15) but to give participants a clear, limited window\u2014approximately two weeks before release\u2014to review the transcripts and request any deletions or edits.  Email acknowledgment of receipt will be required; lack of response will be taken as consent.  This approach balances legal safety, participant privacy, and the practical need to distribute the data without endless delays.",
    "Ms.\u202fJenny\u202fKwan\u2019s remark was a criticism of the disconnect that often exists between the **design of a relief programme and the actual delivery of its benefits**. In the course of the committee\u2019s discussion she noted that the Minister of Employment had been \u201caware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, yet there has been no action.\u201d The \u201cthis\u201d she was referring to is the **failure of single\u2011parent families to receive spousal\u2011support or child\u2011maintenance payments** that should have been covered by the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and related pandemic\u2011relief measures.\n\nKwan\u2019s point is that the government can **draft policies, allocate funding and announce a program on paper**, but those steps alone do not guarantee that the intended recipients actually receive the assistance. She is highlighting a **gap between program development (the policy, the funding, the announcement) and implementation (the administrative processes, the operational rollout, the actual payments to claimants)**. In her view, the gap is not merely bureaucratic delay; it is a tangible shortfall that leaves vulnerable families without the support they were promised, despite the government\u2019s public commitment to \u201chelp as many people as possible, quickly.\u201d\n\nBy drawing attention to this gap, Kwan is urging the Prime Minister and the responsible ministries to move beyond the policy\u2011making phase, to expedite the operational steps\u2014such as processing paperwork, coordinating with Service Canada, and ensuring that eligibility rules are applied correctly\u2014so that the benefits reach the single\u2011parent households that are currently falling through the cracks. In short, her statement underscores that **a programme is only as effective as its implementation, and the current lag is causing real hardship for those it was meant to protect**.",
    "**Project Manager\u2019s view of the last meeting review and market research**  \nThe Project Manager said the minutes from the previous meeting showed that the team had moved from concept to a concrete prototype: a voice\u2011recognition remote with a slide\u2011out panel, a limited button set and optional colour lighting. He judged the review \u201ccoming up to par\u201d and felt the decisions (dropping the touch\u2011screen, keeping the on/off and volume buttons, keeping the solar\u2011cell idea) were solid. Regarding market research, he echoed the survey results \u2013 younger users would pay more for speech\u2011recognition, 80\u202f% wanted a modern look, and many complained about lost or overly complex remotes. He concluded that, while the research validated a premium\u2011look remote, the cost impact (solar cell, extra battery) made the current design \u201cprobably not worth the investment at this point.\u201d\n\n**How he perceived his own presentation content**  \nWhen reflecting on the meetings, the Project Manager described his slides as \u201cready\u2011made\u201d and his minutes as a \u201chigh\u2011powered\u201d summary that would feed directly into the final report. He felt his presentation captured the essential technical and aesthetic decisions and that his delivery was \u201cbrilliant.\u201d At the same time he admitted he had \u201cslipped into the role\u201d and that his final report would stitch together the various inputs.\n\n**Why the group\u2019s opinion differed**  \nThe rest of the team felt the information flow was uneven: several members received blank or incomplete slides, and they sensed a lack of collaborative brainstorming. They argued that the market\u2011research discussion was superficial, that budget overruns (solar cell, battery) were not fully addressed, and that the evaluation focused on the product rather than the process. Consequently, they saw the progress as less decisive than the Project Manager did.\n\n**Group thoughts on using a panther as a drawing**  \nMarketing recalled a childhood fascination with a black panther, describing it as fast, powerful and able to hide\u2014qualities they felt could convey strength for the brand. Others, especially the industrial designer, warned that drawing a panther would be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Overall, the idea was liked for its visual impact but met with practical concerns about execution.",
    "The team agreed that the **key concepts** for the new remote are\u202fsimplicity, ergonomics and a modern \u201chigh\u2011tech\u201d look that still feels familiar.  \n\n* **Push\u2011buttons / multi\u2011operation buttons** \u2013 All participants accepted that the remote must keep the traditional on/off, volume and channel buttons in a thumb\u2011friendly location because these are the most frequently used functions.  There was enthusiasm for the company\u2019s expertise in push\u2011buttons, but several members warned that \u201cmulti\u2011function\u201d buttons (one button performing several actions in different modes) could confuse older or arthritic users and increase the learning curve.  The consensus was to keep dedicated buttons for the core operations and only consider mode\u2011switching for secondary features if the UI can make the mode change obvious (different shapes, tactile cues or colour\u2011coding).  \n\n* **LCD screen** \u2013 The LCD was described as the most attractive, innovative element and a strong selling point for the target\u2011young market.  It would allow menu\u2011driven access to less\u2011used functions, display a clock, and reduce the number of physical buttons.  However, the advanced chip required for an LCD raises cost, and the team debated its placement (top vs. bottom).  Most agreed that a top\u2011mounted screen preserves the familiar remote silhouette while still offering the \u201csizzle\u201d factor.  \n\n* **Microphone / voice\u2011recognition** \u2013 The microphone was seen as a nice\u2011to\u2011have feature rather than essential.  Its position was suggested at the underside of the case or near the bottom edge so it is not visually dominant but remains easily reachable for speech commands.  The group felt voice control could be a differentiator but should not compromise the primary button layout.  \n\nOverall, the remote will retain a conventional push\u2011button core, add an LCD for advanced interaction, and optionally include a discreet microphone for voice control, all wrapped in a curved\u2011one\u2011side, rubber\u2011over\u2011plastic case that meets the company\u2019s style and ergonomic goals.",
    "The pandemic hit Canada\u2019s tourism sector from every angle.  Government\u2011mandated lockdowns and the closure of provincial and international borders halted recreational travel, grounding cruise ships, cancelling cross\u2011border ferries and shutting down festivals, fairs and seasonal events.  The loss was especially acute for regional and rural operators that rely on short\u2011term visitors \u2013 the Saguenay\u2011Lac\u2011Saint\u2011Jean tourism economy (more than\u202fC$300\u202fmillion in activity, including C$58\u202fmillion from cruise traffic) was effectively wiped out, Atlantic\u2011Canada\u2019s cruise\u2011ship traffic vanished (about\u202fC$60\u202fmillion in lost revenue), and the national Tourism\u202fWeek celebration could not be held as a celebration at all.  The industry, which employs roughly 1.8\u202fmillion Canadians, faced cash\u2011flow crises, empty hotels, cancelled bookings and a sudden drop in tax revenues.\n\nThe federal response combined immediate cash relief with longer\u2011term market\u2011stimulation measures.  In May the Minister of Tourism, ACOA and Official Languages announced a C$70\u202fmillion injection to offset tourism losses \u2013 C$30\u202fmillion for Southern Ontario, C$7\u202fmillion for Northern Ontario and C$3.5\u202fmillion for Western Canada \u2013 with parallel outreach to Atlantic Canada through destination\u2011marketing organisations and an extension of support through the end of August.  The government also pledged an additional C$1\u202fbillion to plug gaps for businesses that fall through existing programs, expanded Canada\u2011Emergency Commercial\u2011Rent Assistance, and made extra CEBA loans available to tourism\u2011related firms.  Beyond cash, officials urged Canadians to \u201cexplore the park in your backyard\u201d as national parks reopened on June\u202f1, and they pledged to work with the Tourism Industry Association of Canada and Destination Canada to develop a \u201cnew normal\u201d and a stronger post\u2011pandemic tourism economy.  These steps were intended to keep operators afloat, preserve jobs and lay the groundwork for a rapid rebound once travel restrictions ease.",
    "**Presentation:**  \nThree team members each delivered a concise briefing.\u202fThe industrial designer outlined the overall shape \u2013 an ergonomic, mouse\u2011like body with a single large power button, a side\u2011mounted volume slider, and two modest channel\u2011up/down buttons.\u202fThe user\u2011interface lead described the interaction model: primary voice\u2011recognition for channel selection, volume and power, with a minimal set of physical controls for backup and for functions not covered by speech (e.g., menu navigation).\u202fThe marketing lead emphasized the product\u2019s positioning as a premium, fashion\u2011forward \u201cReal Reaction\u201d accessory that should look instantly recognizable, be \u201ctrendy,\u201d and command a premium price.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n- **Design & Functional Layout:** Consensus that the remote must be sleek, low\u2011profile, and instantly identifiable. Buttons should be limited to power, channel up/down, and a menu/enter key; a side slider will handle volume. Voice commands will replace most other functions, but a few physical keys remain for reliability and to satisfy older users.  \n- **Energy Source:** Agreed on a sealed, long\u2011life primary battery (target 5\u201110\u202fyears) guaranteed for the product\u2019s life. A hybrid option (solar cell plus backup battery) was considered but rejected due to cost and integration complexity.  \n- **Components:** The core will be a custom\u2011designed integrated circuit to accommodate voice\u2011recognition, Morse\u2011code\u2011style IR signalling, and power\u2011management. Off\u2011the\u2011shelf chips were deemed insufficient for the required voice functionality. Supporting components include a diode\u2011transistor IR emitter, a few resistors, capacitors, and the long\u2011life battery.  \n- **Prototype & Production:** A low\u2011fidelity plasticine/mock\u2011up will be produced for ergonomics testing, followed by a functional prototype using the custom chip, battery, and IR module. Interchangeable rubberised covers will allow fashion customization without affecting electronics.\n\n**Decision:**  \n- Adopt the minimalist, mouse\u2011shaped case with a volume slider, power button, channel up/down, and a menu/enter button.  \n- Implement voice\u2011recognition as the primary control method.  \n- Use a sealed, five\u2011year\u2011guaranteed battery as the sole power source.  \n- Develop a custom ASIC to integrate voice processing and IR transmission.  \n- Build a functional prototype for user\u2011testing, then move to production with interchangeable fashion covers.",
    "**Decision on the DARPA meeting**  \nThe group agreed that the upcoming DARPA demo in mid\u2011July must be treated as a \u201cproduction\u2011mode\u201d showcase. By the end of May they will finish the transcriber interface, run the final mock\u2011up of question\u2011answering, and have a clean, publicly\u2011available subset of the data ready for the DARPA audience. The paper describing the work will be posted online before the meeting so that reviewers can see the results, and the team will provide a concise status page (HTML export of the meeting spreadsheet) that lists what has been transcribed, what is still in IBM/ICSI processing, and any remaining gaps.\n\n**Contents of the paper**  \nThe manuscript is organized into three sections that the authors refer to as *the good, the bad, and the ugly*.  \n1. **The Good** \u2013 a quantitative description of speech overlap in the four corpora (Meeting\u2011Recorder, Switchboard, CallHome, and Robustness) and how well the recognizer handles non\u2011overlapped speech.  \n2. **The Bad** \u2013 analysis of the errors introduced by background speech and insertion errors, including a discussion of the speech\u2011non\u2011speech detector\u2019s false\u2011negative and false\u2011positive rates.  \n3. **The Ugly** \u2013 a deeper look at the most problematic cases (high\u2011overlap spurts, back\u2011channel noise, and recordings with laptop or other ambient sounds) and suggestions for future handling.\n\n**Statistics reported in the paper**  \n- **Overlap of words**: Meeting\u2011Recorder meetings contain roughly 17\u201118\u202f% overlapped words; Switchboard and CallHome are almost identical at about 10\u202f% each; Robustness meetings have the least overlap, around 5\u202f%.  \n- **Overlap of spurts** (speech stretches \u2265\u202f500\u202fms without pause): the same relative ordering holds\u2014Meeting\u2011Recorder > Switchboard/CallHome > Robustness.  \n- **Frame\u2011error rates of the speech\u2011non\u2011speech detector**: in \u201cgood\u201d meetings the detector misses less than\u202f1\u202f% of speech frames; in more difficult meetings the miss rate rises to about\u202f5\u202f%.  \n- **Overall insertion error contribution**: most of the extra word\u2011error rate in overlapped regions is due to insertions caused by background speech; when scoring only foreground\u2011speech regions the error drops to near the non\u2011overlapped baseline.  \n\nThese numbers give the DARPA audience a clear picture of what the system can already do, where it still struggles, and how the team plans to move toward a fully operational demo.",
    "The group agreed that the next step should be to train a recognizer on the **TI\u2011digits** corpus and to test it on the same corpus under the same conditions that were used for the Aurora\u20112 experiments.  The plan is to keep the **HTK\u2011based tandem system** that is already in place (HTK acoustic models, PLP/JRASTA front\u2011end, optional MSG filtering) but to replace the current \u201cgeneric\u2011task\u201d training data with the **digits\u2011specific recordings** (or, alternatively, to run a small supervised adaptation of the existing Aurora models on the digits data).  All participants concurred that the scripts that parse the waveform names and generate speaker IDs must be edited so that the TI\u2011digits speaker labels are recognised, and that the same forced\u2011alignment pipeline should be used for both training and testing.\n\nThe **limitations of the current technique** were spelled out: the HTK models were trained on a very limited amount of digit speech, the lapel microphones pick up background and breath noise, the room acoustics differ from the clean studio recordings of TI\u2011digits, and the neural\u2011network front\u2011end is constrained to a small number of output classes, which forces binary\u2011like decisions that do not generalise well across mismatched languages or noise conditions.  Adaptation gave only a few\u2011tenths of a percent gain, and the on\u2011line normalisation code was found to be sub\u2011optimal.\n\nProgress reported includes: baseline Aurora error rates (\u22481\u202f% on clean TI\u2011digits, \u22481.1\u202f\u00d7 when training on a different task, \u22481.3\u202f\u00d7 when using multilingual data), modest improvements from on\u2011line normalisation and delta features, and successful retraining of several MLPs on English, French, Spanish and Italian data.  Forced\u2011alignment has been tightened by increasing pruning and enforcing continuity constraints, which reduced insertion errors.\n\nThe **delays** stem from two bottlenecks: (1) neural\u2011network training and (2) HTK model training, both of which consume comparable CPU time on the limited hardware (only a few 500\u202fMHz processors are available).  Parallelisation is not yet in place, and the upcoming Aurora paper deadline (mid\u2011May) and the digits\u2011paper deadline (early June) leave only a short window for the remaining experiments.  Consequently, the group will prioritise fixing the on\u2011line normalisation, running the TI\u2011digits training\u2011test cycle, and then, if time permits, exploring multilingual or multi\u2011band extensions.",
    "**Advantages of \u201ctriple\u202fR\u201d vs. \u201ctriple\u202fRC\u201d**  \nDuring the naming debate the team agreed that \u201ctriple\u202fR\u201d is cleaner and more memorable. The \u201cRC\u201d suffix immediately reads as \u201cremote\u2011control,\u201d which they felt diluted the brand\u2019s broader fashion\u2011tech positioning. \u201cTriple\u202fR\u201d avoids that literal interpretation, leaves room for the product to be seen as a lifestyle accessory rather than just a functional remote, and fits better on packaging and marketing materials.\n\n**Conclusion on the target age group**  \nThe consensus was to aim the remote at the 15\u201135\u202fyear\u2011old segment. This group is identified as the early\u2011adopter cohort: they have disposable income, are accustomed to using computers and smartphones, and are willing to pay a premium for style, customisation, and new features such as a rubber\u2011feel, interchangeable covers, or an LCD screen. Market research showed they value \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d and are more likely to embrace voice\u2011control or other advanced functions, whereas older users are less tech\u2011savvy and less inclined to spend extra.\n\n**Why marketing chose to focus on young people**  \nMarketing argued that young consumers drive trends and are the most responsive to a fashionable, customizable remote. Their survey indicated that this demographic is ready to pay for a premium look and intuitive usability, and they are the segment that most often adopts new gadgets. Targeting them also aligns with the company\u2019s slogan \u201cputting fashion into electronics,\u201d leveraging the youth\u2019s desire for personal expression and gadget\u2011centric lifestyles.\n\n**Summary of the channel\u2011selection discussion**  \nThe team debated how to organise the remote\u2019s functions. They settled on three \u201cbuckets\u201d: (1) core controls (power, volume, channel up/down), (2) frequently used shortcuts (favorite\u2011channel presets, mute), and (3) optional/advanced features (LCD\u2011displayed channel numbers, voice commands). Teletext was dismissed as outdated. The remote will retain simple numeric entry for direct channel jumps, a \u201czap\u201d button for quick browsing, and the ability to program a small set of favourite channels. The LCD screen, if kept, will mainly support these basic selections rather than elaborate menus, keeping the interface intuitive for the young target audience.",
    "The team\u2019s conversation revealed a clear, data\u2011driven picture of what the new remote must achieve and why a radical redesign is essential.\n\n**Market research:**  Multiple studies (a 100\u2011person survey and focus\u2011group observations) showed that users are dissatisfied with today\u2019s remotes.  Eighty\u2011plus percent would pay more for a \u201cfancy\u201d look, while only ten percent actually use the majority of existing buttons.  Younger consumers (19\u201135) are the most willing to spend on premium features such as speech\u2011recognition or advanced macros; older groups show little interest.  Competitors offer only basic infrared devices, leaving a gap for a stylish, technologically innovative product.\n\n**Desired features:**  The consensus is a minimal\u2011button layout that covers the three core functions\u2014power/on, channel, and volume\u2014plus a programmable \u201cmacro\u201d button that can turn on multiple devices with one press.  Users also asked for a simple menu interface, optional touch\u2011screen or LCD overlay, and a location\u2011finder (beep or radio\u2011based) to reduce lost\u2011remote frustration.  Speech\u2011recognition was praised but flagged as costly; the group agreed to keep it optional pending cost analysis.  Battery life must be reliable; kinetic or solar charging were explored but rejected in favor of standard AA/AAA cells for price reasons.\n\n**Design opinions:**  Market research highlighted that a \u201cfancy look\u2011and\u2011feel\u201d is twice as important as functional innovation, and twice as important as ease of use.  The design brief therefore calls for a sleek, ergonomic shape with a spongy, rubberized grip and vibrant fruit\u2011inspired colour palettes (red, yellow, green) rather than literal fruit shapes.  Plastic is the primary shell material; titanium or metal is deemed too expensive.  A flip\u2011top or two\u2011piece concept was debated, with the final direction favouring a single, curvilinear body that can accommodate a small LCD on the top half and rubberised buttons on the bottom.\n\n**Need for a revolution:**  The team agreed that the remote market is stagnant\u2014most devices are indistinguishable black boxes with dozens of unused buttons.  To capture the projected \u20ac50\u202fmillion sales target, the product must break that monotony by marrying fashion (high\u2011impact aesthetics) with selective technology (macro programming, optional voice control).  This \u201crevolution\u201d is not just cosmetic; it is a strategic shift to create a remote that users actually enjoy handling, that stands out on the shelf, and that justifies a premium price point.",
    "Kirsty\u202fWilliams AM set out a clear, forward\u2011looking framework for quality assurance in Wales.  She said the new tertiary\u2011education commission will be built on three \u201cprinciples\u201d \u2013 coherence, effectiveness and comprehensiveness \u2013 and will be fully compatible with the European ENQA standards.  Rather than imposing a single, monolithic regulator, the commission will use a mix of \u201csoft\u201d powers (advice, guidance and enhanced monitoring) and, where necessary, tougher intervention, all aimed at preserving the high reputation of Welsh universities while encouraging greater collaboration across the sector.  The Minister stressed that any quality\u2011assurance regime must be flexible enough to cover traditional higher\u2011education provision, work\u2011based learning and trans\u2011national programmes without jeopardising institutional autonomy.\n\nWhen Bethan\u202fOwen was asked about the sector\u2019s high\u2011risk institutions, she explained that HEFCW already tracks financial health through five\u2011year forecasts, cash\u2011flow ratios and covenant compliance.  The recent \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d note on Trinity\u202fSaint\u202fDavid was described as a result of timing issues with external funding rather than a governance failure.  HEFCW continues to monitor all universities, including those placed in the high\u2011risk category, and will intervene if cash\u2011flow or covenant breaches become serious.\n\nWilliams also outlined the five principles that will guide any phased return to school: (1) the safety and physical\u2011health of pupils and staff; (2) the emotional\u2011well\u2011being of the whole school community; (3) clear, evidence\u2011based communication so families can plan; (4) a transparent, step\u2011by\u2011step operational plan; and (5) building confidence that the evidence and safeguards are robust before any further reopening.\n\nRegarding the 2020 examinations, the Minister confirmed that grades will be awarded on teacher\u2011predicted grades, moderated nationally to ensure fairness and consistency.  This approach replaces the cancelled exam series and will be applied to both GCSEs and A\u2011levels, with the same rigorous standards used in normal years.\n\nFinally, when members expressed doubt that the actions being taken were sufficient, Williams responded that the government is already \u201cflexible and responsive.\u201d  She promised to write to the committee with detailed data, noted the availability of extra funding for mental\u2011health and student\u2011support programmes, and reiterated that the new commission\u2019s outcome\u2011agreement model, together with the remit\u2011letter powers, will give the Welsh Government the levers needed to protect quality, access and sustainability across the whole post\u2011compulsory sector.",
    "The team\u2019s evaluation of the whole production process revealed a mix of enthusiasm for the creative and collaborative aspects and frustration with constraints and certain tools.\n\n**What they liked**\n\n1. **Creative freedom within the product scope** \u2013 Although the remote was limited to a TV\u2011only function, members appreciated being able to shape the aesthetic (gun\u2011metal gray, \u201ccookie\u2011like\u201d shape, thumb\u2011shaped buttons) and decide how advanced the technology should be (voice\u2011recognition, lithium battery, scroll\u2011wheel).  \n2. **Teamwork and shared resources** \u2013 The wireless laptops, digital pens, and a shared network were praised as \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201chandy,\u201d making collaboration smoother and allowing ideas to flow across design, UI, and marketing.  \n3. **Fashionable, tech\u2011forward identity** \u2013 Marketing and the project manager highlighted the satisfaction of positioning the product as \u201cfashion\u2011forward technology,\u201d enjoying the blend of style and functionality.  \n4. **Prototype experience** \u2013 The physical prototype, even though made of clay, gave a tangible sense of the final product and helped the team feel the shape was comfortable to hold.  \n5. **Budget clarity** \u2013 Running the cost spreadsheet and staying under the \u20ac12.5\u202fk limit gave confidence that the project was financially viable.\n\n**What they disliked**\n\n1. **Restrictive brief** \u2013 The industrial designer felt \u201cstifled\u201d because the company forced the remote to be TV\u2011only, limiting broader creative exploration.  \n2. **Inconsistent or missing features** \u2013 The prototype lacked visible voice\u2011sensor cues, clear channel controls, and a cohesive lighting system, leading to low usability scores (often \u201c2\u201d on the 7\u2011point scale).  \n3. **Tool irritation** \u2013 The digital pens and the survey process were described as \u201cannoying\u201d and \u201cirritating,\u201d reducing the enjoyment of the evaluation phase.  \n4. **Material mismatch** \u2013 The initial materials did not match the intended final finish, forcing the team to \u201ctranslate\u201d the design intent and causing extra work.  \n5. **Unclear button layout** \u2013 Ongoing debate about the number and placement of push\u2011buttons (two vs. three) created uncertainty and slowed decision\u2011making.\n\nOverall, the team valued the collaborative, stylish, and budget\u2011friendly nature of the process but was frustrated by the narrow product brief, incomplete prototype features, and some cumbersome tools.",
    "The team spent a good portion of the meeting analysing why the **mean\u2011subtraction** step in the SRI recognizer appeared to improve performance on the Aurora experiments, especially for the PZM (pressure\u2011zone\u2011microphone) channel.\n\n* **Purpose of mean subtraction** \u2013 Several participants (grad\u202fe, professor\u202fb) agreed that the operation was intended as a form of **channel normalization**. By subtracting the time\u2011averaged log\u2011spectrum (or, in an earlier trial, the raw FFT magnitude phase) from each frame, the algorithm removes a static bias that is different for each microphone and for each recording condition. This is analogous to a gain\u2011control or \u201cDC\u2011offset\u201d compensation that can raise the effective signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio (SNR).\n\n* **Observed effect on PZM data** \u2013 After applying mean subtraction the re\u2011synthesised PZM signals sounded louder. The group debated whether this was simply a multiplicative gain (which would leave SNR unchanged) or whether the subtraction actually **improved SNR** by suppressing low\u2011energy reverberant components that otherwise mask speech. Professor\u202fb pointed out that if the absolute level is changed in both training and test, the recogniser should be invariant; however, grad\u202fe noted that the Aurora baseline system, which includes the mean\u2011subtraction, showed a lower word\u2011error rate, suggesting a real benefit beyond a trivial scaling.\n\n* **Interaction with other processing** \u2013 Mean subtraction was contrasted with other normalisation ideas (high\u2011pass filtering, VAD\u2011based low\u2011energy removal, DC\u2011offset compensation). The consensus was that mean subtraction works best when applied **consistently** to both training and test data, and that it may complement channel adaptation methods (e.g., MLLR) already present in the SRI system.\n\n* **Open questions** \u2013 The group raised two unresolved issues: (1) whether the gain\u2011like effect is due to an inaccurate estimate of the mean spectrum (producing occasional over\u2011subtraction and amplification of small values), and (2) how mean subtraction interacts with the more sophisticated acoustic models of the SRI system versus the simpler HTK baseline. Further experiments were proposed to vary the mean\u2011estimate window and to test the effect on both near\u2011 and far\u2011mic conditions.\n\nIn summary, the discussion concluded that mean subtraction functions as a channel\u2011normalising gain control that can improve SNR for low\u2011energy, reverberant microphones such as PZM, but its exact contribution relative to other normalisation steps remains to be quantified through controlled experiments.",
    "**Mixed\u2011signal VAD and recent improvements**  \nThe team has been wrestling with the fact that the current VAD operates on a \u201cmixed\u2011signal\u201d (speech\u202f+\u202fnoise) stream, which forces a large latency (\u2248\u202f220\u202fms) because the neural network must see nine frames of context plus delta computation. To reduce this, a series of low\u2011level changes were tried: (1) adding a spectral\u2011subtraction front\u2011end, (2) applying on\u2011line normalization after the noise\u2011compensation stage, and (3) tightening the high\u2011pass filter to \u2248\u202f100\u202fHz. When these steps are combined, the VAD\u2019s error\u2011rate drops from the original level to roughly 20\u202f% relative improvement on the well\u2011matched test set, and overall word\u2011error reduction climbs to about 60\u202f% for clean recordings. The new VAD also runs faster (\u2248\u202f40\u202fms of noise cleaning plus a 100\u202fms smoothing window) and can be placed in parallel with the tandem network, eliminating the extra 220\u202fms delay.\n\n**Postdoc\u202fA\u2019s view of the new headphones**  \nPostdoc\u202fA reported that the newly purchased headphones have substantially higher gain than the older pair, which had been a limiting factor for low\u2011level recordings. The new set is \u201cmuch more comfortable\u201d and yields fewer transcription corrections, although it still falls short of the performance of the specialised head\u2011mounted mics used in other projects.\n\n**Alternative ways to increase acoustic space**  \nSeveral ideas were floated for enlarging the capture area without adding more microphones: (i) hanging a fabric\u2011mounted microphone panel on a wall (a low\u2011cost \u201cPZM\u201d style array), (ii) using two PDAs with their built\u2011in mics to create a modest stereo aperture, (iii) deploying a small microphone array (\u2248\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 elements) in the room to enable beam\u2011forming, and (iv) exploiting the existing close\u2011talking mics together with a distant\u2011mic array to triangulate speakers.\n\n**Key deadline**  \nThe next hard deadline is the data\u2011release date of **15\u202fJuly**, after which the corpus will be made public and any remaining consent\u2011form issues must be settled. A secondary milestone is the **15\u202fNovember** evaluation deadline for the upcoming EuroSpeech submission.",
    "Special schools are incorporated directly into the new\u2011purpose framework as essential education settings that must remain operational for their pupils, rather than being moved to separate sites.  The principle articulated by the Minister and senior officials is that, even though many children in special schools are isolated because of health\u2011related restrictions, the support they need should be delivered \u201cwithin the original school.\u201d  Head\u2011teachers therefore retain discretion to keep the school open for staff to plan and to provide the range of activities identified for key\u2011worker families, but they are not expected to close simply to re\u2011site pupils.  In practice this means special schools continue to receive the same guidance, safeguarding checks and wellbeing provision that apply to mainstream schools under the new purpose, while also being allowed the flexibility to adapt staffing and social\u2011distancing arrangements as required.\n\nThe PDG for looked\u2011after children operates differently.  That grant is allocated regionally through PDG co\u2011ordinators and the four regional consortia, which set strategic priorities, monitor spend and require evidence of impact.  The funding can be used for individual placements, capacity\u2011building programmes (e.g., attachment\u2011disorder training) or whole\u2011system support, and its use is subject to detailed scrutiny and an external evaluation (ICF Consulting).  Thus, while special schools are part of the core school\u2011wide purpose arrangement, schools receiving looked\u2011after\u2011children PDG are part of a targeted, regionally\u2011managed stream that sits alongside the broader consortia\u2011led school\u2011improvement work.  Both rely on regional structures, but special schools\u2019 role is to maintain continuity of provision for their specific pupil cohort, whereas the PDG for looked\u2011after children is a distinct, purpose\u2011specific resource overseen by the consortia to ensure strategic deployment and accountability.",
    "The prototype was first shown as a physical mock\u2011up that the three team members handled together.  \nThe **User\u2011Interface lead** described the overall layout: the device is held in a hand\u2011shaped shell that \u201cmoulds\u201d to the palm, with a large power button on the left, an infrared emitter on the front, a scroll\u2011type volume control on the left side and channel\u2011up/channel\u2011down buttons on the right.  The cover is a thin, rubber\u2011like \u201cspongy\u201d skin that snaps over the plastic core, exposing holes for the buttons and a red\u2011tinted logo\u2011plate.  The **Industrial Designer** added that the shell is made of lightweight plastic, the rubber cover is similar to iPod\u2011style protective cases, and the whole thing can be taken apart without tools.  The **Project Manager** confirmed the functional blocks (power key, IR transmitter, cover, button holes) and asked how the device would be positioned on a table or stand, suggesting a slightly wider base if it is to be used as a decorative \u201cfashion\u201d item.\n\nWhen the group turned to **making the remote universal**, the conversation shifted to the electronics and signalling logic rather than the exterior shape.  The Industrial Designer pointed out that a universal remote would need a processor capable of generating different infrared codes for each TV brand, which would require a \u201cregular\u201d chip (for scroll\u2011wheel functions) or an \u201cadvanced\u201d chip (for a display).  The Project Manager asked whether a standard set of Morse\u2011style codes could be used, noting that this would increase complexity and cost.  Both agreed that research is needed to confirm whether a single chip can handle the many protocols, and whether the remote should include a menu\u2011level interface for less\u2011common functions.  The team also discussed interchangeable covers that could be colour\u2011coded for different markets or languages, but concluded that a truly universal remote would likely need more buttons and a more sophisticated chip than the current budget allows.  Consequently, they decided to keep the prototype simple and evaluate later whether a universal version is feasible within cost and design constraints.",
    "During the prototype review the industrial designer repeatedly emphasized three themes \u2013 how the remote looks, how it is built, and what the end\u2011user is likely to want.\n\n**Appearance**  \nThe designer described the visual language as \u201cbright blue with yellow (and other coloured) buttons\u201d and noted that the LED indicator is a \u201cfluorescent\u2011green\u201d light. The colour scheme is intended to be eye\u2011catching and playful, matching the marketing insight that younger customers are attracted to fruit\u2011 and vegetable\u2011shaped, colourful products. The case is described as a \u201csingle\u2011curve, biomorphic shape \u2013 no sharp angles, round and comfy in the hand.\u201d The designer also mentioned a possible \u201csilver\u2011titanium\u201d finish for a premium look, but ultimately settled on a bright\u2011blue plastic shell because it is inexpensive and still visually striking.\n\n**Structure / Materials**  \nThe remote\u2019s structure is a hard, recyclable plastic shell that is \u201cvery strong\u201d yet lightweight. The buttons are made from a soft\u2011rubber material so that they feel \u201cspongy\u201d to the touch, which the designer argued would be more comfortable for prolonged use. The LED, the microphone array, and the speech\u2011recognition switch are all integrated into the same housing without adding bulk. The designer also stressed that the case is ergonomically shaped to fit a single thumb, allowing all functions to be reached without the user having to reposition the hand.\n\n**Customer Preferences**  \nFrom the market research the designer echoed that users want a device that is \u201ceasy to hold, thumb\u2011reachable, and eye\u2011catching.\u201d Younger consumers, in particular, prefer bright colours, soft\u2011touch buttons and a playful shape, while older users value a robust, non\u2011slippery surface. The designer concluded that the combination of a bright, colourful appearance, a soft\u2011rubber button surface and an ergonomic single\u2011curve body directly addresses the stated customer preferences for a remote that is both attractive and comfortable to operate.",
    "The\u202f$75\u202fmillion earmarked for sexual exploitation and human\u2011trafficking was introduced as a new pillar of the government\u2019s national anti\u2011trafficking strategy.\u202fHon.\u202fChrystia\u202fFreeland told the committee that the money is being directed to the \u201cempowerment\u201d component of the plan \u2013 funding front\u2011line shelters, crisis\u2011response services and community\u2011based NGOs that assist victims.\u202fShe said hundreds of organizations have already received support and that additional announcements will be made shortly, but she could not give a line\u2011item breakdown because the disbursements are still being finalised.\n\nIn the Welsh higher\u2011education committee, Dr.\u202fDavid\u202fBlaney explained the government\u2019s \u201csolution to risk appetite.\u201d\u202fHEFCW monitors institutional forecasts and borrowing requests, asking universities to justify any optimistic growth assumptions.\u202fWhen a university\u2019s projected cash\u2011flow or debt\u2011service ratios appear imprudent, the agency intervenes with questions and, if necessary, forces a reassessment of the institution\u2019s risk profile.\u202fThe aim is to keep risk\u2011taking within a prudent range and to prevent \u201cridiculously optimistic\u201d plans that could jeopardise financial stability.\n\nRegarding systemic racism,\u202fFreeland repeatedly stressed that the government recognises racism as a pervasive problem and is taking concrete steps to combat it.\u202fShe highlighted the anti\u2011racism secretariat\u2019s $6.2\u202fmillion investment in Statistics Canada to collect race\u2011based data, affirmed the Liberal opposition to racial profiling and pledged a review of RCMP use\u2011of\u2011force policies.\u202fFreeland framed the issue as \u201cnot simple\u201d but insisted that addressing it is a moral and policy priority, linking data collection, policing reform and broader anti\u2011racism initiatives as the government\u2019s coordinated response.",
    "The team\u2019s segmenter \u2013 the automatic speech\u2011boundary detector that Thilo has been developing \u2013 is now fully operational and is being moved from a research prototype into the production pipeline.  In earlier meetings the group noted that all of their recognition experiments had relied on \u201chand\u2011segmentations\u201d (i.e., manually created boundaries) and that this was essentially cheating.  During the latest discussion they agreed that Thilo\u2019s segmenter is performing well enough to replace the manual step.  It delivers a very high recall (it tends to over\u2011generate boundaries), which the researchers view as an advantage because the excess segments can be used to train noise\u2011model components for the recognizer.\n\nThe most recent change is that the segmenter has just been run on a new sample meeting and the output has been sent back to the team for validation.  This test is intended to verify whether the automatic segmentation resolves the \u201ctoo many beeps\u201d problem that appeared in the previous transcription pass.  If the results are satisfactory, the plan is to adopt the automatic segmenter for all upcoming DARPA\u2011July meetings and to base the recognizer\u2019s evaluation on these automatically generated boundaries rather than on hand\u2011crafted ones.  In short, the segmenter is now considered reliable, is being actively tested on fresh data, and is slated to become the default front\u2011end for the next round of experiments.",
    "**Why the price dispute arose in the interactive evaluation**  \nThe User\u2011Interface (UI) designer insisted that price be a separate evaluation criterion because the user\u2011requirements brief listed \u201caffordable\u201d as a core need. When the team tried to estimate material and programming costs, the UI realised that the kinetic\u2011energy source, the LCD screen and the custom\u2011colour finish would push the unit above the \u20ac12.5 ceiling. The Industrial Designer, however, assumed a \u201ccheap\u2011to\u2011produce\u201d approach (simple rubber buttons, hard\u2011plastic shell) and rated the price as a true\u2011positive (1 on the 1\u20117 scale). Marketing, aware of the market\u2011trend for premium\u2011looking fruit\u2011themed gadgets, gave a middle rating (2). The clash therefore stemmed from different cost assumptions and from the UI\u2019s priority to keep the product within the budget that the user\u2011requirements demanded, whereas the Industrial Designer and Marketing were more tolerant of a higher price in order to meet the hot\u2011trend for a stylish, fruit\u2011inspired look.\n\n**Why the UI opposed a redesign after product evaluation**  \nDuring the product\u2011evaluation phase the project manager announced that no redesign would be allowed once the prototype was judged. The UI argued that the evaluation was \u201ctoo quick\u201d and that any negative user feedback would require a redesign window; otherwise a flawed first generation could jeopardise sales. The UI stressed that a proper redesign cycle is essential for meeting the \u201ceasy\u2011to\u2011use\u201d requirement and for protecting the investment in the UI\u2011software (menu programming, IR chip). The project manager\u2019s stance left the UI feeling that the process ignored the need for iterative improvement.\n\n**Why the UI suggested yellow and red as the basic colours**  \nThe UI referenced the company\u2019s visual identity\u2014bright yellow with black accents\u2014as the default palette. Yellow is highly visible for older users, satisfies the \u201ceasy to find\u201d button requirement, and matches the fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable market trend that marketing had identified. Red was added for contrast and to reinforce the \u201cfancy / stylish\u201d perception demanded by the hot trend. Together they fulfill brand consistency, accessibility, and trend alignment.\n\n**Why marketing disagreed with the UI on the product\u2019s shape**  \nMarketing wanted a banana\u2011shaped, fruit\u2011like silhouette to capitalize on the \u201cfruit/veg\u201d trend and to create a distinctive, eye\u2011catching appearance. The UI, however, flagged ergonomic concerns: a curved banana form could reduce structural robustness, make the remote harder to grip, and increase production cost (rubber vs. hard plastic). Marketing prioritized visual novelty, while the UI prioritized functional ergonomics, durability, and cost efficiency\u2014hence the disagreement.",
    "**How effectively the Welsh Baccalaureate prepares learners for employment \u2013 the panel\u2019s view**\n\n- **Kay\u202fMartin (Cardiff & Vale College)** \u2013 Martin acknowledges that the bac can be a useful tool when it works, especially for learners who already have strong literacy, numeracy and digital foundations. In those cases it helps meet employer expectations for a well\u2011rounded graduate. However, she stresses that the qualification is not fit for every pathway; for many vocational routes (e.g., health and social care) the bac adds little value and can overload students who are still building basic skills. Martin points to alternative programmes such as Career\u202fReady, six\u2011week internships and BTEC routes, which she says engage employers far more effectively. She calls for a review of the bac and better integration with these existing schemes rather than treating the bac as a stand\u2011alone employment driver.\n\n- **Dafydd\u202fEvans (Colegau\u202fCymru/Gr\u0175p\u202fLlandrillo\u202fMenai)** \u2013 Evans is markedly sceptical. He argues that most employers cannot even articulate what the Welsh bac entails, and the title itself obscures its purpose. Consequently, the bac is not currently delivering the employability and entrepreneurial skills it was designed to provide. He recommends a thorough redesign that puts employers at the centre of the qualification, linking the bac to contractual clauses and social\u2011value contracts so that business input is systematic rather than tokenistic. Until such ownership is achieved, he believes the bac does not effectively prepare learners for work.\n\n- **Nick\u202fBrazil (Gower College Swansea)** \u2013 Brazil echoes the concern that employers rarely request the bac and question whether its rigorous, bureaucratic structure actually cultivates the professional skills they need. He notes that the heavy workload\u2014combining resits, core subjects and the Skills Challenge Certificate\u2014dilutes focus on genuine employability outcomes. Brazil calls for a re\u2011examination of the qualification to ensure the intended skills are truly embedded, and suggests that other industry\u2011linked programmes may be more successful in preparing learners for employment.\n\n**Overall consensus:** while the bac has potential, all three panelists agree that, in its current form, it falls short of reliably equipping learners with the skills and employer recognition needed for successful employment.",
    "The team expanded the original concept by adding a range of functional and design ideas that move the remote beyond a simple TV controller.  \n\n**Core functions** \u2013 Everyone agreed that the remote must retain the essential on/off, channel\u2011up/down, numeric entry and volume controls. A mute button and a programmable \u201cmenu\u201d button were added to give quick access to audio\u2011, subtitle\u2011 and picture\u2011settings without cluttering the face\u2011plate.  \n\n**Interaction refinements** \u2013 The UI group proposed a scroll\u2011wheel (the \u201cgreen little scrolly guy\u201d) for channel\u2011zapping and favourites, a rubber\u2011covered button area for durability, and a larger power button to improve ergonomics for older users. They debated a trigger\u2011style button to prevent accidental power presses and suggested that any extra controls be hidden in a drawer\u2011like compartment or grouped into three \u201cbuckets\u201d (habitual, optional and advanced) to keep the layout clean.  \n\n**Advanced features** \u2013 Marketing and the industrial designer floated optional upgrades: a locator beacon/base station that beeps to find a lost remote, a rechargeable charging dock, and a smart\u2011chip that could make the unit universal across TV, DVD and stereo equipment. Speech\u2011recognition was discussed as a premium add\u2011on for tech\u2011savvy or disabled users, but the cost and reliability concerns kept it in the \u201coptional\u201d bucket.  \n\n**Aesthetic and branding** \u2013 The industrial designer showed a prototype with a white plastic body, red rubber accents and a possible yellow light strip for key illumination. The team agreed to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan (\u201cfashion in electronics\u201d) subtly\u2014either as a logo or a small accent\u2014while keeping the overall look sleek, silver/black, and fashion\u2011forward.  \n\n**Technical choices** \u2013 Infra\u2011red transmission will remain the baseline to meet the new requirement of controlling only the TV and to keep development time short. Power will be supplied by standard batteries; a rechargeable option will be evaluated only if the added functions demand more energy.  \n\nOverall, the team\u2019s additional ideas create a modular, ergonomic remote that can be launched with a solid basic set of functions, while offering optional upgrades (locator, voice control, rechargeable power) and a stylish, brand\u2011aligned design.",
    "The Project\u202fManager repeatedly stressed that the remote must be positioned for an **international, mass\u2011market range** \u2013 primarily Europe and North America but open to any culture or trend.\u202fHe rejected a niche\u2011business focus and said the product should appeal to \u201canyone under about sixty,\u201d from tech\u2011savvy adults to grandparents (and even pets), emphasizing a design that is both stylish and easy to use.\n\nOn **price**, the PM fixed a selling price of **\u20ac25** and a hard ceiling on production cost of **\u20ac12.5**.\u202fHe calculated that, to reach the **\u20ac50\u202fmillion profit target**, the programme must sell roughly **four million units**.\u202fConsequently, every added feature is weighed against its impact on the \u20ac12.5 cost ceiling; waterproofing, an advanced LCD or USB interface are flagged as potentially prohibitive.\n\nRegarding the **new features proposed by Marketing** (universal control of TV, DVD, VCR; programmable channels; an LCD menu screen; a \u201cmonkey\u2011noise\u201d locate function), the PM liked the idea of a single, multi\u2011device remote but warned that past universal remotes suffered signal loss and cumbersome programming.\u202fHe approved a modest LCD/menu concept if it can stay within the cost envelope and remain intuitive for older users, but he opposed a flood of tiny buttons or overly complex software.\n\nOn the **feasibility of a multipurpose remote**, he noted that the basic IR architecture is viable, yet reliability and cost must be proven before committing to extra chips or battery\u2011saving technologies.\u202fHe stressed that the **selling target must be set early** so the team can gauge market size and confirm whether the \u20ac25 price point is realistic.\n\nWhen the group moved to the **new remote style**, the PM pushed for an original, trendy look\u2014preferably a soft\u2011rubber or spongy material with optional colour choices\u2014while keeping the design simple enough for all ages.\u202fHe outlined the next steps: individual functional\u2011design work, a follow\u2011up conceptual\u2011design meeting, and finally a detailed\u2011design session, ensuring each phase respects the \u20ac12.5 cost limit and the overall sales\u2011target agenda.",
    "User\u202fInterface (UI) consistently framed the design discussion around the project\u2019s hard\u2011line cost ceiling and the revenue goal that the remote must meet.  \n\n**Cost constraints** \u2013 UI reminded the team that the unit price is capped at roughly \u20ac25, with a production\u2011cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50 per remote.\u202fAny feature that threatens to push the bill of materials above that limit was flagged as a problem. UI stressed that the \u201cselling price of the product will be about twenty\u2011five euros\u201d and that \u201cthe product production cost must be maximal twelve\u2011twelve Euro and fifty cents.\u201d\u202fConsequently, UI urged the team to keep the design \u201coriginal, trendy, user\u2011friendly\u201d but without \u201cfancy stuff\u201d that would inflate cost.\n\n**Financial targets** \u2013 UI translated the cost ceiling into a volume target: to achieve profitability the remote must sell at least four\u202fmillion units.\u202fThe comment \u201cwe have to sell at least four million to make our own profit\u201d was repeated, linking the \u20ac12.50 cost ceiling directly to the need for high unit sales. UI therefore treated every design decision through the lens of whether it would jeopardise hitting that four\u2011million\u2011unit threshold.\n\n**Replacement of kinetic batteries** \u2013 When the idea of dropping the kinetic\u2011energy battery in favor of a conventional cell was raised, UI\u2019s reaction was pragmatic.\u202fUI noted that \u201ccustomers never said anything about the battery,\u201d implying that the kinetic system is not a market\u2011driven requirement.\u202fHowever, UI cautioned that removing the kinetic battery would alter the cost picture: \u201cIf we go to a regular battery\u2026 the biggest one would be taking away\u2026 shape and colours, that\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t compromise.\u201d\u202fThus UI saw the kinetic battery as an optional, potentially cost\u2011inflating feature; its removal could simplify the design and help stay within the \u20ac12.50 cost limit, provided the aesthetic and ergonomic goals remained intact.  \n\nIn summary, UI\u2019s stance was that the remote must stay under \u20ac12.50 to meet the \u20ac25 selling price, sell four\u202fmillion units to be profitable, and that the kinetic battery could be eliminated without harming user appeal, thereby preserving the strict financial constraints.",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer clashed because they were speaking from fundamentally different priorities.  \n\n**Marketing\u2019s agenda** was to create a product that could be sold on the basis of \u201cwow\u2011factor\u201d features.  The team repeatedly suggested kinetic\u2011energy generation \u2013 a shake\u2011to\u2011charge system that could be highlighted in advertising \u2013 and an up\u2011gradable architecture that would let the company release future modules, extend the warranty, and generate repeat sales.  From a market\u2011viewpoint these ideas promised differentiation, a premium price\u2011point and a story that would appeal to tech\u2011savvy buyers and to the press.\n\n**The Industrial Designer\u2019s agenda** was rooted in feasibility, ergonomics and the target user (older adults).  He argued that a shake\u2011to\u2011charge mechanism would be unintuitive for seniors, could make the remote feel flimsy, and would add moving parts that jeopardise durability and the clean, simple aesthetic the design brief demanded.  Up\u2011gradability meant extra connectors, modular boards, and a larger chassis \u2013 all of which would increase weight, raise production cost, and complicate the sleek, single\u2011piece form the designer was trying to achieve.  He also warned that a modular warranty would be harder to manage and could undermine the \u201clifetime\u2011guarantee\u201d promise the marketing team wanted to make.\n\nIn short, **Marketing wanted bold, sellable innovations** that could be marketed as cutting\u2011edge, while **the Industrial Designer wanted a practical, reliable, and age\u2011appropriate remote** that stayed within cost and usability constraints.  Their disagreement stemmed from these opposing lenses on what the product should be and how it could realistically be built.",
    "The committee heard a detailed briefing on the role of HEFCW (the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales) and the limits of its current intervention powers. \u202fMinister Kirsty\u202fWilliams explained that, under the 2015 Higher\u2011Education Act, HEFCW already has a range of \u201csoft\u201d powers \u2013 advice, guidance and enhanced monitoring \u2013 as well as the ability to impose formal sanctions when an institution breaches funding conditions. \u202fShe stressed that these powers are not \u201cthreatening\u201d or inflexible; they are used informally because the sector is small and relationships with university leaders are strong. \u202fThe Minister noted that, despite recent high\u2011profile disputes at Swansea and Trinity\u202fSt\u202fDavid\u2019s, HEFCW has not needed to invoke its formal powers, preferring to support institutions through dialogue and targeted advice.\n\nThe discussion then turned to the upcoming post\u2011legislative reform (the PCET Bill). \u202fBoth the Minister and officials from HEFCW agreed that the new commission should retain the graduated approach \u2013 from informal support to more punitive measures \u2013 but with clearer, statutory steps that can be applied to a larger tertiary sector (including the 50\u2011plus FE providers). \u202fThey acknowledged that the current Act was not designed for a much larger, more diverse provider landscape and that the new legislation will give Welsh Ministers explicit powers to intervene in FE and HE, including temporary closure orders, direction of staff and resources, and flexibility on ratios and funding arrangements.\n\nFinally, the committee was assured that, while universities remain legally autonomous and any decision to close remains with the institution, the government is in ongoing conversations with FE and HE providers about continuity of learning and the possible use of those new statutory powers if a closure becomes necessary for health or financial reasons. \u202fNo immediate closure orders were announced; instead, the focus was on building a regulatory framework that can intervene early, support institutions proactively, and, where required, exercise the new powers to protect students and the public.",
    "The team\u2019s marketing plan centers on positioning the new universal remote as a premium\u2011priced, globally\u2011compatible lifestyle product that can be sold for\u202f\u20ac25 per unit while keeping production costs around\u202f\u20ac12.50. Their profit goal\u2014\u20ac50\u202fmillion in sales\u2014will be reached by moving roughly two million units, so the strategy focuses on maximizing unit volume through broad market appeal and supplemental revenue streams.\n\nKey elements of the strategy are:\n\n1. **International Compatibility** \u2013 The remote must work with all major TV standards (PAL, NTSC, SECAM) and with the company\u2019s upcoming DVD player, as well as other home\u2011entertainment devices. This universal functionality is marketed as a single\u2011controller solution for households worldwide.\n\n2. **Cultural & Ergonomic Simplicity** \u2013 Buttons will use internationally recognisable symbols and be sized for easy thumb operation. The layout will be intuitive so users of any age or culture can learn it quickly, reducing the need for extensive instruction.\n\n3. **Premium, Trend\u2011Driven Design** \u2013 The product will feature high\u2011quality hard\u2011plastic housing, rubberised buttons, and optional interchangeable face\u2011plates in colours or finishes (e.g., sleek silver/titanium) that allow personalisation. A possible touch\u2011screen or minimal\u2011button concept is being explored to differentiate the remote from low\u2011cost competitors.\n\n4. **Competitive Benchmarking** \u2013 Marketing will analyse rival remotes and incorporate successful features (e.g., a dedicated DVD\u2011TV toggle button) while avoiding overly complex, \u201cboxy\u201d designs that users reject.\n\n5. **Revenue\u2011Generating Add\u2011Ons** \u2013 Sale of interchangeable fronts and custom colour kits provides an extra margin and encourages repeat purchases.\n\n6. **Pricing & Cost Control** \u2013 By fixing the retail price at \u20ac25 and targeting a material cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50, the team ensures a healthy gross margin that supports the \u20ac50\u202fmillion profit target.\n\n7. **Research & Communication** \u2013 Ongoing market research, competitor reviews, and documentation in the project folder will guide refinements. The marketing manager will record decisions, coordinate with design and UI teams, and ensure the product\u2019s messaging emphasizes its universal, stylish, and user\u2011friendly nature.\n\nThrough a combination of universal functionality, sleek customisable design, and disciplined cost management, the group expects to capture a large global audience and achieve the projected \u20ac50\u202fmillion profit.",
    "During the emergency session on the impact of COVID\u201119 on education, the Committee heard a detailed overview of the Welsh Government\u2019s pandemic response and its implications for children who receive free\u2011school meals (FSM).\u202fThe Minister for Education confirmed that, despite the decision to close schools for statutory teaching, the Government will keep schools open for staff to plan and to deliver a \u201cnew purpose\u201d \u2013 providing emergency support for key\u2011worker families, vulnerable pupils and young carers.\u202fLocal authorities and headteachers were asked to identify children on the at\u2011risk register and to use professional judgement to include any other pupils whose home circumstances make school attendance essential (e.g., those witnessing domestic abuse).\u202fThe emergency powers granted by the forthcoming legislation will allow Ministers to direct schools to remain open, to relax staffing\u2011to\u2011pupil ratios, and to repurpose school facilities for childcare or food distribution.\n\nFree\u2011school\u2011meal provision will continue throughout the closure, with the aim of delivering a seamless service that does not pause for the Easter holidays.\u202fThe Government will use existing funding streams (the universal childcare offer, Flying\u202fStart, and other grant schemes) to pay for meals even when pupils are not physically present.\u202fWhile the Minister stressed that the quality of the food, rather than the free status, is the priority, she noted that guidance on school\u2011catering standards is being reviewed \u2013 particularly around sugar content and alignment with the 2013 healthy\u2011eating regulations \u2013 and that schools may be encouraged to adopt healthier packed\u2011lunch practices without imposing a nanny\u2011state approach.\n\nPhysical education was highlighted as a critical component of overall health.\u202fBoth the Minister and public\u2011health officials acknowledged that many children are not meeting activity guidelines and that participation drops sharply for girls in the teenage years.\u202fThe Committee discussed whether statutory guidance for PE should be introduced, but the response was that any such guidance will be subject to the wider Healthy\u202fWeight:\u202fHealthy\u202fWales consultation.\u202fThe emphasis is on making sport enjoyable, tailoring activities to different audiences, and ensuring that any PE guidance is integrated with the broader \u201cnew purpose\u201d plan rather than imposed as a separate mandate.\n\nIn summary, the pandemic response combines emergency legislative powers, coordinated local\u2011authority action, and continued FSM funding with a focus on safeguarding vulnerable children, maintaining food quality, and preserving physical\u2011activity opportunities while the education system adapts to the crisis.",
    "User Interface pushed for a curved, ergonomic shape because the team repeatedly highlighted the need for a remote that \u201cfits as comfortably as possible into the hand\u201d and that a \u201cbiomorphic\u201d form would let the device \u201cconform to the shape of the hand more efficiently.\u201d  The curve was seen as the simplest way to achieve that ergonomics without adding costly articulation; a single\u2011curve underside would let the joystick rest naturally on the palm while still allowing a solid, inexpensive plastic case.  UI also noted that a rubber\u2011covered grip would reinforce the ergonomic intent and make the remote \u201cspongy\u201d and less likely to slip.\n\nThe group\u2019s consensus on the four key attributes emerged from the marketing brief and repeated cross\u2011checking of the evaluation criteria.\u202f\u201cEasy to use\u201d was justified by the desire for a minimal button layout (two buttons plus a joystick) that could still support macro functions without the complexity of a touchscreen.\u202f\u201cFashion\u201d was required because Real\u202fReactions\u2019 strategy demands every product be \u201cinspired by material fashion and clothing fashion\u201d; the team repeatedly linked the remote\u2019s yellow, fruit\u2011/banana\u2011like colour and curvy silhouette to current style trends, treating the remote itself as a fashion accessory.\u202f\u201cEasy to find\u201d stemmed from the problem of remotes being lost in clutter; UI argued that a bright, non\u2011neutral colour (yellow) and a rubber tail that drapes over the wrist would make the device stand out visually and physically, reducing loss.\u202f\u201cRobust\u201d was secured by choosing rubber for the grip and a solid plastic shell, which both protect the electronics and survive everyday handling.\n\nDuring the discussion, UI evaluated fashion by explicitly comparing the remote\u2019s colour and shape to \u201cfruit and veg\u201d trends and to \u201cbanana\u2011shaped\u201d wireless phones, rating the aesthetic highly (six\u2011seven out of seven). The fashion score was reinforced by the marketing team\u2019s affirmation that the remote\u2019s look met the company\u2019s \u201cfashion\u2011in\u2011electronics\u201d mandate, confirming that the curvy, bright design satisfied the style requirement."
