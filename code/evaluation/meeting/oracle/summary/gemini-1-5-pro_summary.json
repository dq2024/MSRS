    "The group discussed several needed changes.  The use of English in the digits task was a concern, with some suggesting training the recognizer on more English data or finding a way to account for the mismatch between training data and the digits task. Another needed change was the ability to feed different features into the recognizer to test different front-end processing techniques.  Finally, improvements to the forced alignment process were discussed, including better handling of pruning, word locations, and background speech. The professor emphasized the importance of comparing results to a well-defined baseline and suggested trying the recognizer on a standard digits test set like TI-digits. He also questioned the use of HTK, suggesting the group explore using more data or a different system altogether.  He highlighted the need for the recognizer to handle different features to facilitate front-end research and expressed interest in exploring how improvements on a simpler system might transfer to a more complex one.\n",
    "The group discussed the structure of the user and situation models within the framework of a belief-net system.  They debated the granularity of values within nodes like \"Go-there,\" settling on a binary true/false approach, influenced by factors such as user type (local/tourist) and discourse cues.  The \"user budget\" node sparked a discussion about its representation, ultimately deciding it should be externally updated and influence decisions through range-based conversions.  User finances were viewed as a separate, more general financial policy.  They explored the influence of user interest (represented as a 500-value vector) and considered a \"fit\" node to measure the compatibility between user interests and entity features. The group acknowledged the complexity of incorporating the full user state and favored a simplified approach for computational feasibility, suggesting a \"compatibility\" node summarizing the user's overall state.  They also discussed how ontology properties (e.g., \"selling,\" \"exhibiting\") would feed into decision nodes, potentially merging related properties for certain decisions. A key concern was managing the combinatorial explosion from multiple influencing nodes, leading to discussions about expert weighting schemes, including simple weighted averages and mixtures of experts (using a hidden variable to select the most reliable expert).  Data acquisition for learning these weights was identified as a challenge.  The importance of avoiding loops in the belief net for well-defined computation was emphasized.  Finally, the group addressed the challenge of displaying the complex network, proposing interface modifications to enhance readability.\n",
    "Discussions regarding the Canadian economy's uncertainty and the government's actions during the pandemic were prominent throughout the meetings.  Concerns were raised about the lack of a fiscal update, the impact of COVID-19 on various sectors (forestry, tourism, agriculture), the effectiveness of government aid programs (wage subsidy, rent relief), and the potential for fraud in benefit applications.  There was also discussion of the government\u2019s commitment to a green economic recovery, in light of investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nCathy McLeod criticized the government's refusal to provide an economic update, characterizing it as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coutrageous,\u201d particularly given the pre-existing economic challenges and the significant drop in government revenues. She emphasized that households understand their financial situations and the government should be equally transparent. McLeod also pressed for support for the forestry industry, highlighting its pre-pandemic struggles and the lack of specific aid despite promises of action.\n\nMona Fortier, responding on behalf of the government, acknowledged the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. She stated that the government had been transparent in its bi-weekly reports to Parliament on the costs and status of its aid measures.  Fortier reiterated that a full economic update would be provided as soon as clear projections were available.  She defended the government\u2019s actions, highlighting measures like the wage subsidy.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie raised concerns about large corporations accessing the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) despite utilizing tax havens. While praising the government\u2019s stance against tax evasion, he questioned whether companies legally exploiting tax havens were truly paying their fair share.  He sought clarification on whether the government considered such practices acceptable for LEEFF recipients.\n",
    "The industrial designer highlighted the tiger's strategic hunting style, emphasizing its calculated approach and preference for secure, hidden vantage points.  These characteristics seem to be valued for their potential application in designing a user-friendly and intuitive remote control, suggesting a focus on thoughtful placement and ease of use within a user's environment.\n",
    "The team discussed the limitations of the current transcriber interface, particularly its inadequate handling of overlapping speech.  They explored alternative transcription tools, including a tool developed at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich and another used at CMU, but these proved unsuitable due to being error-prone, unsupported, or unavailable.  They considered Praat but dismissed it as inappropriate for their needs.  A \"thorough-going musical score notation\" was considered the ideal solution for representing overlaps.  Team members discussed modifying their existing interface or using other tools to achieve this type of multi-channel, timeline-based transcription.  They also discussed the possibility of using IBM's transcripts and tools, including a potential modification to Transcriber by Dave Gelbart.  The team acknowledged the need for improved overlap encoding, including start and end points, to enhance the corpus.  They weighed the benefits of improved transcription against the time constraints of the project and the availability of funding.  A detailed analysis of overlaps was suggested as a potential use of transcriber time, given the current funding situation.\n",
    "The design team decided to use kinetic energy storage as the primary power source with a backup battery.  The remote\u2019s case will be double-curved and made of a firm rubber material, possibly with a hard plastic interior chassis.  The exterior case will come in a variety of \u201cfruity\u201d colors with removable covers. Pushbuttons will be used for the primary controls, and a small LCD screen with a spinning wheel will provide access to an on-screen menu.  The team decided against incorporating a separate device to manage the parental control feature.  Instead, parental controls will be an optional software feature built into the remote and accessible from the on-screen menu.  Voice recognition will also be included.  The team also suggested the remote\u2019s packaging resemble a piece of fruit, such as a lemon, with the peel acting as the box covering.\n",
    "Early implementer areas for the Welsh Government's childcare offer have provided valuable insights.  One key lesson revolves around the administrative burden of the current system.  Parents are required to submit various documents, including wage slips and birth certificates, to prove eligibility. This process has proven difficult, especially for families with complex situations.  Additionally, the pilot program's limited scope has created confusion and frustration among parents residing both inside and outside the designated areas, leading to questions about eligibility criteria.\n\nThe administrative burden on local authorities is also significant, as they manage the eligibility verification process and track changing work patterns and salaries.  To address these challenges, the Welsh Government's preferred option is to adopt a centralized system modeled after HM Revenue and Customs, enabling streamlined information sharing between government departments and reducing the burden on parents and local authorities.  This model is supported by local authority providers.  While concerns exist regarding capacity and the potential fragility of the childcare sector, the government believes the phased rollout, coupled with a \u00a360 million capital investment and a 10-year workforce development plan, will create a more resilient system.  The phased approach allows for continuous learning and adjustments based on factors such as rurality and cost variations in urban areas.  The government remains confident in achieving full rollout by 2020, despite challenges related to cultural childcare practices, the need for increased communication with parents and providers, and ensuring equitable access for lower-income families.\n",
    "The Project Manager expressed reservations about the feasibility of incorporating speech recognition, citing potential interference from background noise and usability issues, particularly for actions like adjusting the volume during dialogue. Although voice control was initially considered a desirable \"fancy\" feature for younger demographics, cost constraints and practicality concerns led to its eventual exclusion. The Project Manager also questioned the value of an LCD screen given the prevalence of teletext and existing TV menus, suggesting its potential redundancy.  However, the team ultimately agreed on incorporating an LCD screen for enhanced user interface features, like an interactive program guide. The Project Manager championed the idea of a scroll wheel for navigation, inspired by its success in other devices, and favored a minimalist button design supplemented by the scroll wheel and LCD screen interaction. Cost constraints were a significant factor in decision-making, with the Project Manager emphasizing the need to stay within budget.  This led to the decision to offer a basic model with customizable covers to accommodate the \"fashion\" aspect of the product while maintaining affordability. The Project Manager also advocated for a \"spongy\" or rubberized feel for the remote, based on market research indicating consumer preference for this tactile quality, prioritizing this over color options due to budget limitations.  The final design prioritized functionality and user experience within the given cost constraints, with the Project Manager expressing satisfaction with the team's creative solutions, such as the exchangeable covers and scroll wheel, to differentiate the product in the market.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed improving audio quality for various research purposes (dialogue, prosody, transcription). They decided to standardize on high-quality head-mounted microphones and acquire more wireless microphones to replace the existing, problematic wired ones.  The team also discussed the limitations of their current 16-channel recording setup and considered incorporating microphone arrays for improved directionality and speaker localization, but acknowledged the technical challenges and resource requirements associated with such a setup.  They explored the possibility of collaborating with researchers interested in array processing who could utilize their meeting room and data.  Video recording was also discussed. While recognized as valuable by external researchers, internal interest was low, and concerns about human subjects issues and consent were raised.  The team decided not to prioritize video recording at that time.\n",
    "The team discussed project finance, noting a target selling price of \u20ac25 for the remote control, which was expected to generate \u20ac50 million in profit.  There was concern about designing the product to fit this price bracket before understanding user needs and what customers would be willing to pay. This financial constraint ultimately led to the removal of some features, like the sample speaker, to stay within budget.\n\nThe whiteboard was used extensively throughout the design process.  It facilitated brainstorming and allowed for more dynamic idea generation compared to the static nature of PowerPoint presentations.  The whiteboard sketches enabled the team to visualize the remote control\u2019s design, including button placement, features, and overall form. It also helped in evaluating different design options and making real-time adjustments based on budget considerations and user feedback.  The team found the whiteboard essential for collaborative design and decision-making.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer focused on the technical aspects of the remote, exploring options like infrared vs. Bluetooth, battery power vs. kinetic energy, and the inclusion of features like voice recognition. They also considered the remote's physical design, emphasizing material quality and ergonomics. They were concerned about balancing functionality with cost, especially given the target selling price.  The Industrial Designer also stressed the importance of aligning the remote's design with the company's image of sleek, innovative technology.\n\n\nThe Project Manager facilitated the discussions, focusing on meeting the financial goals and marketing requirements.  Initially, they targeted a selling price of \u20ac25 with a \u20ac50 million profit goal.  The Project Manager questioned the viability of voice recognition given the target demographic and favored simpler, cost-effective solutions.  They also emphasized the importance of corporate branding and ensuring the remote's design aligned with the company's existing product line.  Following team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the team had designed a viable product within the budget constraints, despite some compromises on innovation and aesthetics.  They noted the team's progression in teamwork and communication over the course of the project.\n",
    "The team explored various remote control concepts, prioritizing fashion and technological innovation alongside functionality.  They debated the current trend of fruit and vegetable patterns, ultimately deciding against it due to its fleeting nature.  They considered a spongy texture for the remote, aligning with current fashion, but its implementation remained tied to the chosen material.  Existing remotes were analyzed for their pros and cons.  The team favored simplistic designs with clear labeling and considered features like a scroll wheel, inspired by the iPod, and raised or shaped buttons for easy identification in the dark.  A child-friendly design with limited channel access was also discussed.\n\nThe team leaned towards a smaller, more compact remote with a locating device, prioritizing modern trends over a bulkier design with a charging base.  They opted for a plastic base with interchangeable latex covers, allowing for adaptable aesthetics, potentially featuring a cherry pattern to align with the current fruit trend.  The team decided against full voice control, favoring a simpler voice-activated locator function.  A lithium battery was chosen for its prevalence in other electronics.  The logo placement was debated, with a potential location on the on/off or menu button, or a dedicated area on the casing. A gunmetal gray or shiny black base color was favored, with potentially illuminated buttons.  The final design included a central button, potentially a four-way scroll, side scroll buttons, and clearly labeled buttons on top.  The team expressed some concern over the remote's limited functionality, controlling only the TV.\n",
    "The group discussed various aspects of a new remote control design.  Driven by a \"fruity\" and \"vegetable\" trend, they explored spongy materials and bright, primary colors, prioritizing aesthetics over functionality.  An LCD screen was favored over speech recognition due to cost and complexity, with the team opting to leverage the television screen for menus.  A central scroll wheel, reminiscent of an iPod, was considered for navigation but ultimately rejected due to potential usability issues with extensive channel lists.  Pushbuttons remained the preferred choice for channel selection.  Interchangeable covers, reflecting the fruit/vegetable theme, were proposed to enhance the remote's appeal.  Titanium, initially considered for the casing, was dismissed due to its incompatibility with curved designs.  A latex or similar material was favored for a comfortable, \"spongy\" feel.  The team decided on a simple chip to minimize costs, as the chosen pushbutton design did not necessitate a more advanced chip.  A kinetic energy source, activated by movement, was deemed an innovative feature.  Finally, a questionnaire was developed to evaluate the design against user requirements, market trends, and company strategy.\n",
    "The project manager introduced the remote control prototype alongside the user interface and industrial designers. They highlighted the \u201csurfboard\u201d shape, designed to evoke a browsing experience. The initial single-function prototype, costing eight Euros, featured a conventional button layout and catered exclusively to TV controls.  A second, \u201cmagic\u201d prototype offered enhanced functionality, including an LCD screen, integrated microphone for speech recognition, a locator LED, and a cover for potential tactile features, priced at sixteen Euros.\n\nThe team favored the multi-functional prototype due to its innovative features like the LCD screen and speech recognition, deeming it more appealing to their target demographic of 20-40 year-olds.  However, the single-function model's lower cost made it attractive from a profit perspective.\n\nLower grades in the technological aspect stemmed from concerns about the feasibility and cost of the speech recognition feature, particularly its susceptibility to interference from ambient noise.  The team debated the necessity of an LCD screen, considering its cost against its potential to enhance user experience.\n\nThe locator feature, initially a blinking LED, evolved into a potential \u201cbeeper\u201d activated by a button on the TV or even through speech recognition, addressing the common user complaint of lost remotes.  This feature tied into their market research, which emphasized the importance of \u201cfindability.\u201d\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C primarily discuss Jose\u2019s (PhD D) work on overlap detection.  Initially, Jose uses log energy, but struggles to see distinctions between single and multiple speakers.  PhD C suggests comparing the distributions of energy levels for single speakers, two speakers, and perhaps three speakers to see if any separation exists. They agree that pitch and harmonics should also be helpful features. PhD C advises Jose to first examine simple energy before moving to more complex features.  PhD A suggests using scatter plots for visualizing multiple features, but PhD C cautions against this until the effectiveness of individual features is understood.\n\nThey discuss normalization methods and agree that the chosen method should match the feature's distribution. PhD D proposes analyzing the speech of individual speakers and their overlaps in isolation to identify clearer patterns.  PhD D and postdoc B raise a concern about the \"conservation of energy\" during overlaps, questioning whether speakers might soften their speech when overlapping. PhD C refutes this, stating they do not have equalization in their setup.\n\nPhD C reiterates the importance of finding a measure that reflects the intuitive observation that energy usually increases during overlaps.  PhD D emphasizes the need for accurate time markings, which they plan to obtain through forced alignment. They briefly discuss using existing tools like the Switchboard system for alignment. PhD D offers to categorize overlap types, which postdoc B agrees would be helpful.  PhD D suggests considering the duration of overlaps and adjusting the normalization window accordingly, particularly for short backchannel overlaps.  PhD C is unsure about this approach, arguing that if gain is compensated for, the frame-level energy change should still be detectable. They agree to explore different window sizes.  Finally, they agree that Jose should prioritize analyzing energy and then move to harmonicity and pitch.\n",
    "The discussion centered around latency introduced by noise reduction techniques, specifically spectral subtraction with smoothing and Wiener filtering.  The professor expressed concern over the added latency because it could negatively impact the real-time usability of the SmartKom system, particularly for interactive applications like asking for directions. He emphasized the need to consider latency implications throughout development to avoid being forced to make drastic reductions later. He suggested a conservative approach to prevent potential issues.\n\nThe specific latency introduced by the smoothing in spectral subtraction was 50 milliseconds. This delay stemmed from the recursive nature of the smoothing algorithm, which performed better when using an estimate from the future rather than solely relying on past data.  While using only past data reduced latency, it also reduced the effectiveness of the smoothing by approximately 3% relative. The professor questioned the necessity of this latency and suggested exploring alternatives. He also pointed out that latency issues extended beyond noise reduction, highlighting other system components and the need for a comprehensive approach to latency management. He suggested buffering strategies, but acknowledged the limitations of variable latency introduced by techniques like TCP buffering.  The group also discussed the trade-offs between latency and accuracy, noting that lower latency processing often came at the cost of performance.\n",
    "The User Interface designer introduced a prototype remote with an ergonomic, customizable wood casing.  Functionally, the remote features on/off, volume, channel, and menu controls, as well as voice recognition. An LCD screen is incorporated into the flip panel, but could be removed if cost-prohibitive.  A large yellow button controls power, while dark blue buttons comprise the numeric pad. Menu access is on the right, and voice control activation is on the left.  The back panel and flip case can be customized.  The microphone placement was debated, with the User Interface designer advocating for side placement for accessibility even when the remote is closed.  The User Interface designer expressed concern that the egg-shaped buttons were not economical, but conceded that the remote needed some weight. The team ultimately agreed on the design and moved to financial discussions.\n",
    "The prototype evolved through several iterations across multiple meetings. Initially, the industrial designer presented a titanium remote with a side view that the project manager found uncomfortable. The team discussed button placement, the company logo, and a slogan.  Despite some disagreement about the side view's ergonomics, the team ultimately approved the initial design. However, cost concerns later arose.\n\nTwo versions of the prototype emerged. The first, presented by the user interface and industrial designers, was a banana-shaped remote with scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a banana-leaf base station for charging and locating the remote. This version retained the titanium casing.  The second version, prompted by cost constraints, replaced the titanium with rubber and plastic. It featured a simplified button layout for basic functionality while maintaining the double-curved, ergonomic shape. This version also incorporated kinetic energy harvesting, eliminating the need for batteries.\n\nThe team evaluated both versions against criteria like \"fancy,\" \"innovative,\" and \"easy to use.\"  While the banana design was praised for its novelty, the second, more cost-effective, rubber prototype was deemed more practical.  The final design moved away from the literal banana shape towards a more stylized form.  The team concluded that the second prototype was the best option, given the cost constraints and market research indicating consumer preference for a trendy, spongy feel. They also agreed that the speech recognition technology was not yet mature enough for integration.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the design and functionalities of a new remote control, navigating budget constraints and exploring innovative features.  A touch screen interface was initially considered a key selling point but ultimately rejected due to the high cost.  Instead, they opted for voice recognition, leveraging existing in-house technology.  The team explored various battery options, including lithium and solar power, with a preference for the latter due to its eco-friendly nature and cost-effectiveness.  A backup battery was suggested to address potential limitations of solar power.\n\nThe design of the remote was a major focus.  A flip-screen, similar to those on flip phones, was proposed to protect the buttons and conserve battery.  Ergonomics were also considered, with discussions around a curved shape molded to the user's hand.  The possibility of customizable wooden casings was explored but raised concerns about durability, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Alternative materials like rubber and plastic were considered due to their affordability and durability.  A sleek, non-traditional design, possibly resembling a paperweight, was suggested, along with the use of natural colors and a spongy feel.  Multiple case colors were proposed to cater to different tastes, while maintaining a consistent overall design.  The team also discussed simplifying the button layout, focusing on essential functions while relegating less frequently used features to a secondary position, possibly within a flip-top compartment or a slide-out panel.  A small LCD display was considered but potentially dropped due to cost.  The inclusion of a \"find me\" feature, like a beep or flashing light, was also discussed to address the common problem of lost remotes.\n",
    "The Welsh Government is applying lessons learned from the three-year Schools Challenge Cymru program to its broader school improvement initiatives.  A key takeaway is the vital role of strong school leadership in driving positive change.  The program also highlighted the importance of robust tracking systems to monitor individual student progress and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.  Effective teacher quality and collaborative working between schools are also emphasized as crucial factors for improvement.  While Schools Challenge Cymru was a time-limited program focused on secondary schools, the government aims to incorporate these successful elements into a wider, whole-system approach encompassing all schools and sectors.  This includes continuing the improvement boards established during the program and utilizing the schools categorization system to provide targeted support, with red-categorized schools receiving increased support days.  The government acknowledges varying degrees of success among schools in the program, attributing this to factors such as the complexity of school needs and the effectiveness of individual advisors.  Despite some reported tensions between the program and regional consortia, the government emphasizes the positive relationships and knowledge transfer that occurred, with key personnel from Schools Challenge Cymru now working within regional consortia to disseminate best practices.  While some stakeholders suggest the program needed a longer duration for full impact, the government maintains it was designed as time-limited, with a key legacy being the investment in regional school improvement capacity.  The government also stresses its commitment to learning from all involved in the program, gathering feedback from various stakeholders, including individual schools, local education authorities, and regional consortia, to inform future improvement efforts.\n",
    "Dr. Blaney believes the drop in EU student applications to Welsh universities is likely due to two factors. First, changes in student support arrangements for EU students created uncertainty.  While the financial deal for EU students in Wales is comparable to, or even better than, England's, this change initially perturbed prospective students.  Second, Wales struggles with the \"Anglocentric\" nature of UK media, making it harder to attract students.  Additionally, the comparatively lower investment in Welsh university facilities compared to English institutions makes them appear less attractive to students who often equate modern campuses with quality education.\n\nTo counter this, Welsh universities are collectively working on the \"Study in Wales\" campaign to promote the country as a safe and supportive study destination with a UK-quality degree.  Dr. Blaney highlighted the relative safety of Welsh cities, particularly compared to larger English cities, as a key selling point for international students and their parents.  He acknowledged the need for continued efforts to increase Wales' presence in the international market.\n",
    "The mental spaces discussed in the meeting transcripts include domains relevant to a tourist navigating a city, such as locations, their properties (e.g., \"nice walls,\" whether a place is \"closed,\" whether it \"has a door,\" admission fees), and the user's intentions (e.g., \"Tango,\" \"Enter,\" \"Vista\"). Additional domains mentioned are those related to the user's status (tourist, business person, or unknown), time of day, discourse context (e.g., previous utterances related to admission fees), and the user's emotional state (e.g., \"hurry\").  These domains are represented as nodes in a Bayesian network.\n\nThe middle layer of the Bayesian network functions as a bridge between observable features (e.g., words used, prosody) and the user's ultimate intention (e.g., to enter a building). It contains hidden variables representing more abstract concepts or plans, such as whether the user is on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry. These hidden variables are probabilistically influenced by the observable features and, in turn, influence the probability of the user's intention. For example, discussing admission fees might increase the probability of the hidden variable \"running an errand,\" which might then increase the probability of the intention \"Enter.\"  The layered structure aims to avoid direct connections between observed features and intentions, allowing for more nuanced inferences based on the interplay of multiple factors. The participants also discuss the possibility of multiple middle layers, with some representing more general discourse phenomena and others related to specific cues.\n",
    "The professor advocated for saving all the SmartKom data, including the far-field channels, due to potential acoustic research applications.  He believed the data should be integrated into the existing Meeting Recorder corpus, using the same tools and conventions, but stored in a separate directory to avoid misrepresenting it as meeting data. He also suggested using a consistent procedure for handling all data types to simplify management and avoid creating extra work.  Regarding long-term storage, the professor acknowledged the limitations of CDs and favored tape archiving for data preservation, suggesting a discussion with Dave Johnson to determine the optimal approach.  He also supported using non-backed-up drives for immediate storage, with a one-time backup to tape to alleviate strain on the nightly backup system.\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted seniors, particularly those in long-term care homes, with a disproportionate number of deaths occurring in these facilities. Discussions highlighted the crisis, including appalling conditions such as neglect, inadequate care, and insect infestations, revealed by Canadian Armed Forces reports.  Debate arose regarding jurisdiction, with some emphasizing provincial responsibility for long-term care and others calling for national standards akin to the Canada Health Act.  The for-profit model of long-term care also drew criticism, with calls to prioritize care over profit.  Additionally, concerns were raised about the relationship between racism and long-term care, urging for a review of policies and practices.\n\nAmendments to policies protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were discussed, with calls to strengthen bankruptcy laws to safeguard pensions and benefits.  Specifically, concerns were raised about the impact of corporate bankruptcies on workers' livelihoods, urging government action to protect their rights.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay, Veterans Affairs Minister, faced questions about veterans' compensation, particularly concerning the financial outcomes for ill and injured veterans.  He emphasized the government's commitment to providing appropriate compensation and encouraged public debate on policies and programs affecting veterans and their families.  Concerns were also raised about the practice of \"red-flagging\" veterans' files.\n\nThe Minister of Seniors announced pandemic assistance for seniors, including a one-time tax-free payment for OAS and GIS recipients.  However, this measure was criticized for being insufficient to address seniors' financial struggles.  There were also calls for permanent increases to OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty.  The government defended its actions, stating that the financial support provided exceeded platform commitments.  Discussions also touched on the need for pandemic assistance for people with disabilities.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer had disagreements stemming from differing priorities and perspectives.  Marketing emphasized consumer appeal, suggesting trendy aesthetics and features like interchangeable faceplates, even if they increased costs or deviated from traditional remote control design. The Industrial Designer focused on practicality, cost-effectiveness, and technical feasibility, favoring simpler designs, established technologies like infrared, and questioning the value of complex features like speech recognition. The Project Manager attempted to balance these viewpoints, acknowledging the need for originality and market appeal while also emphasizing profitability and reasonable production costs.  These conflicting priorities led to discussions about the remote's shape, buttons, features, and overall design, with each participant advocating for their preferred approach.  For example, the doubly curved shape was eventually abandoned due to practicality concerns, and speech recognition was deemed too costly and time-consuming.  Ultimately, decisions were often made by consensus or through the project manager's guidance, reflecting the need to compromise between competing design ideals.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation around a shortlist of criteria they felt were important to the product's success.  These criteria included:\n\n1.  **Look and feel:** How aesthetically pleasing and physically comfortable the remote was.\n2.  **Innovation:** The presence of novel features and functionalities.\n3.  **Ease of use:** How intuitive and user-friendly the remote was.\n4.  **Demographic appeal:** How well the product resonated with the target audience of 20-40 year olds.\n5.  **Company motto:** Adherence to the company's philosophy of integrating fashion and electronics.\n6.  **Fashion trends:** Incorporating current style trends, such as the fruit and vegetable theme.\n\nThe team rated each prototype on a scale, averaging the scores to arrive at a final evaluation.  Price was a significant factor, as the team had a strict budget to adhere to.\n",
    "Transcription of approximately 11 hours of meeting recordings is complete, though a final editing pass is still pending to ensure data cleanliness, markup consistency, and correct handling of numbers and acronyms according to established conventions.  An additional 20+ hours of recordings are available but not yet transcribed.  A total of roughly 35 hours of recordings, including digit read data, has been collected to date.  A large batch (approximately 10 hours) of meeting recordings is ready to be sent to IBM for transcription.  Digit data is being collected regularly as part of the standard meeting procedure and will be made available to researchers as it is transcribed.  Work is in progress to improve the timing accuracy of speech segments in the transcripts, leveraging recent advances in channel-based speech/nonspeech segmentation.  The final format for participant review of transcripts is still under discussion. A web-based interface has been developed to facilitate review and allow participants to mark sections for redaction, but concerns were raised about data privacy, ease of redaction leading to over-redaction, and consistency with the informed consent agreement.  A compromise solution involving initial contact with participants to offer review and obtain approval via email, followed by providing printouts and web access with passwords if requested, is being considered.  The specific wording of participant communications will be carefully reviewed to balance the desire for minimal redaction with participant rights. The schema for intermediate categories and their relationship to the SPG (Source-Path-Goal) schema is still being actively discussed and refined. While a basic structure involving action schemas, image schemas (like SPG), and roles has been outlined, questions remain about the hierarchical organization, representation of bindings between roles, enforcement of schema constraints, handling of multiple simultaneous schemas, and overall notational conventions. XML examples are being developed to clarify the proposed structure and facilitate further discussion.  The team is also exploring expanding data collection efforts by recording other types of meetings at ICSI and potentially collaborating with local broadcast media to obtain multi-channel recordings of panel discussions or similar events.\n",
    "In the Stage 2 proceedings of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, the Deputy Minister, Julie Morgan, addressed her amendments related to public awareness, reporting, and regulation-making powers.  She proposed amendments 1 and 4, mandating Welsh Ministers to conduct an awareness campaign about the legal changes concerning physical punishment of children.  She defended this six-year campaign as a response to a Stage 1 committee recommendation, emphasizing the need to inform the public.  She rejected amendments 1A to 1E proposed by another Assembly Member, Janet Finch-Saunders, arguing that specifying target groups and topics for the campaign was unnecessary and risked emphasizing certain groups over others.  The Deputy Minister stated that existing legal frameworks already addressed children's rights and safeguarding procedures.\n\nRegarding reporting, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2, requiring a post-implementation review, again referencing a committee recommendation. She described the review as a continuous process, involving attitudinal surveys and data collection through a dedicated task force.  She dismissed amendment 2C, which called for a pre-commencement report on public awareness, deeming it unnecessary and conflicting with the goal of a fixed commencement date. She agreed, however, to consider some elements of 2B, related to the interim reporting period, for potential inclusion at Stage 3.\n\nFinally, concerning regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister proposed amendment 3, reinstating the power to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions connected to the Bill\u2019s commencement.  This was deemed a technical amendment, necessitated by the removal of commencement-by-Order powers.  She argued against the need for broader regulation-making powers, as suggested in amendment 3A, but agreed to further discussion on the matter before Stage 3.  Throughout, the Deputy Minister emphasized collaboration with stakeholders, existing legal frameworks, and the thoroughness of impact assessments in defending her position.\n",
    "Long-term trends in raising standards and improving educational attainment are challenging to analyze due to changes in performance measures. While these changes, like shifting from a narrow focus on Level 2 Plus to broader indicators including well-being and a wider range of GCSE subjects, aim to benefit learners, they create difficulties in comparing progress over time.  The Welsh Government uses diverse data sources, including school categorization trends, Estyn reports, exam results, and international assessments like PISA, to gain a holistic view of educational performance.  However, directly comparing current data with past data is problematic given the shifts in assessment methods.  A key concern is closing the attainment gap, particularly for pupils eligible for free school meals, looked-after children, and some minority ethnic groups.  Despite significant investment through the pupil development grant, progress in closing this gap remains unsatisfactory, prompting the exploration of new approaches and a deeper understanding of the complex factors influencing attainment within these groups.\n\nAccording to Philip Blaker of Qualifications Wales, the organization's primary role is regulating awarding bodies like WJEC, focusing on qualification design, assessment delivery, and maintaining standards.  This involves approving specifications, ensuring teachers understand expectations through sample materials, and setting and monitoring grading processes.  Blaker emphasizes the importance of comparable outcomes during periods of qualification change to ensure fairness and consistency in grading.  He also highlights the current reliance on commercial publishers for textbooks, a model he suggests needs review, advocating for a shift towards textbooks as broader curriculum resources rather than qualification-specific materials.  This, he believes, would reduce the pressure on the system caused by frequent textbook revisions tied to specification changes.  Furthermore, he emphasizes the need for careful consideration of timelines for future reforms, particularly those related to the new curriculum, to avoid the pressures experienced during recent GCSE and A-level reforms.  Blaker advocates for a collaborative approach involving awarding bodies, Welsh Government, and stakeholders to address resource needs and ensure system readiness for future changes.\n\nThe issue of a lack of exams, specifically related to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been addressed by canceling the summer exam series.  Learners will receive grades based on existing work and teacher assessments.  Qualifications Wales is working with counterparts across the UK on a modulated system to ensure standards are maintained and grades are comparable.  The exact approach to grading, including the weighting of different assessment components and considerations for potential bias, will be communicated to schools and students by WJEC and Qualifications Wales.  There is ongoing discussion regarding how to handle AS-levels for Year 12 students, as well as vocational qualifications like BTECs.\n",
    "Implementing good practices across Wales in childcare services faces challenges due to regional variations in provision, demand, and cultural practices.  Some areas have historically higher childcare demand and existing infrastructure, while others, particularly in the Valleys, rely on informal family care.  This creates an uneven playing field and makes universal implementation difficult.  The Welsh Government's childcare offer aims to address these challenges through a phased rollout, piloting in diverse areas to understand regional variations in demand, cost, and cultural preferences before national implementation.  However, concerns remain regarding the single national hourly rate, as costs are significantly higher in urban areas like Cardiff and Newport.  The reliance on free school meals eligibility to target disadvantaged children also raises concerns, as it may not capture all children in need and could exclude those from workless households.  While the government emphasizes the offer's positive impact on working parents, research suggests limited effects on net income, poverty, or work behavior.  Additionally, the focus on key stage 4 performance measures in secondary schools might divert resources from sustainable skill development and create unintended consequences, such as discouraging vocational qualifications.  Finally, while the government aims to improve the quality of childcare, there is a tension between upskilling the workforce and maintaining affordability within the current rate structure. The government acknowledges these challenges and plans to address them through ongoing evaluation, collaboration with providers, and adjustments to the offer as needed.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed component availability and design for the remote.  Kinetic charging with a watch-type battery was chosen over standard double or triple A, dynamo, or solar charging due to size, cost, and novelty.  The casing will be plastic to allow for varied shapes, and a rubberized sleeve, available in fruit and vegetable colors, will provide the desired spongy feel and interchangeable designs.  A flip-top design was selected, with an LCD touch screen for less frequently used buttons on the top and rubberized, anti-RSI buttons for volume and channel control on the bottom.  The bare circuit board option was rejected due to the difficulty of distinguishing button locations.  While a built-in mirror was suggested and dismissed, voice recognition, activated by calling the remote, is under consideration, dependent on cost.  A port and alarm feature, utilizing existing stock, is also planned.  The team prioritized a trendy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use, in that order.\n",
    "The professor expressed concern over the relatively high error rate of 3.4% on the Meeting Recorder digits compared to the 0.8% achieved on the TI-Digits database. He acknowledged the system's strengths, including adaptation and a modern design, but highlighted the impact of data amount and recording conditions on performance. He suggested using a larger dataset and noted that the Meeting Recorder digits were more realistic than the TI-Digits, potentially contributing to the higher error rate. He questioned the system's handling of noise and channel effects and proposed feeding tandem data into the SRI system for comparison. He also inquired about Eurospeech submissions and stressed the importance of publishing impactful results, suggesting focusing on the improved VAD's performance, despite its size. He later discussed pronunciation variability in the dataset, advocating for natural readings of digits rather than prescribed pronunciations like \"O\" versus \"zero,\" noting personal preference for \"zero\" in telephone conversations.  He also inquired about using Matlab to determine voiced and unvoiced portions of speech, specifically questioning the decision to omit pre-emphasis and offering suggestions for voiced/unvoiced detection features like spectral slope and autocorrelation. He commented on the visibility of harmonics after mel-filtering, particularly with high-pitched voices, suggesting modifications for smoother low-frequency spectra and proposing a rough pitch estimation method from FFTs.\n",
    "The team discussed introducing a new remote control project. The primary goal was to create a trendy, original, and user-friendly product to gain a competitive advantage.  A key decision involved the target demographic. While the remote aimed to have international appeal across age groups, the focus shifted to consumers who could afford the added features, particularly those in the 20-40 age range with disposable income but hesitant to purchase expensive universal remotes.\n\nSeveral concepts were explored. Kinetic energy, generated by movement, was favored as the primary power source, potentially supplemented by traditional batteries.  A double-curved, rubberized case, possibly incorporating \u201cflashy, fruity colors\u201d and removable covers, was chosen for a modern, dynamic aesthetic.  The team leaned towards pushbuttons for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, though the inclusion of an iPod-like scroll wheel for menu navigation and channel surfing was debated.  An LCD screen, either on the remote or as an on-screen display, was deemed essential for displaying menu options and program information.\n\nThe team explored additional features. A \u201cfind-me\u201d function, activated by a button on the television, was proposed to address the common problem of lost remotes.  Waterproofing was considered but ultimately dismissed due to practicality concerns.  Parental controls, while acknowledged as a desirable feature by the market research, raised concerns about development time, cost, and potential user complexity.  Ultimately, this feature was deemed optional and potentially tied to user profiles.  Voice recognition and built-in games were discussed but considered secondary features due to cost and technical feasibility.  A universal remote functionality, allowing control of multiple devices, was considered a key selling point, particularly given the increasing prevalence of DVD players, VCRs, and set-top boxes.  The team agreed to benchmark against competitors\u2019 universal remotes to identify essential features and user interface trends.\n",
    "Vaughan Gething expressed general concern regarding children and young people's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and acknowledged the potential for a spike in suicides.  He stated that the Welsh Government commissioned a review, conducted by the delivery unit in conjunction with a national advisory group (including Dr. Ann John), to investigate unexpected deaths during the early stages of the pandemic.  This review aims to determine the pandemic restrictions\u2019 effects on mental health and well-being and ascertain whether there has been a resulting increase in suicides. A report is expected by the end of the month.  Regarding perinatal mental health, Gething mentioned the government's efforts to maintain and adapt services, including shifting to phone and online support where possible. He acknowledged concerns about women's reduced willingness to utilize mother and baby unit provisions due to fear and lockdown restrictions, assuring these trends would not influence future planning for such facilities.  While committed to creating in-patient perinatal mental health capacity, he admitted uncertainty about the timeline due to pandemic-related disruptions.\n",
    "The implementation work for the new national model, which includes recommendations for additional services like specialist human resources and governor support, will be ongoing.  The strategic delivery group, chaired by Professor Dylan Jones, is working with officials on a plan to support implementation of the new curriculum. This plan will clarify roles and responsibilities within the middle tier and ensure effective collaboration between partners. There was concern expressed about the strategic delivery group losing focus as its work evolved to encompass broader aspects of the education system beyond simply streamlining the middle tier. However, the Minister for Education believes the group remains focused on establishing clear roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication of effort and ensure effective collaboration within the middle tier.\n\nRegarding networking within the PRU, there has been an improvement in networking within the PRU sector, including professional learning, visits to provisions, and utilizing expertise within the sector to work more closely with schools.  For transition arrangements, there's a focus on providing support for students transitioning back into mainstream education from PRUs, including part-time timetables and continued support.  However, reintegrating students, especially at the key stage 4 level, presents a greater challenge, and the focus shifts to transitioning them into further education and colleges. There are also concerns about delays in accessing EOTAS provisions, primarily due to capacity issues and the need for robust systems to ensure all necessary steps have been taken to support the learner in their original school setting.  There was discussion of how some schools manage capacity through funding devolution and action plans for spending allocated funds for EOTAS learners.\n",
    "The infrared functionality was considered essential, with a focus on reliability and clarity to avoid users having to reposition the remote repeatedly.  The team discussed the optimal transmission method, concluding that infrared was superior due to its lack of line-of-sight requirements.  The chip's role in processing and transmitting data via infrared was highlighted as crucial.  There was a concern about the cost of high-quality components to ensure a strong infrared signal.\n\nDisposable income was a significant factor in determining the target demographic.  The team considered the affordability of a 25-euro remote, noting that the 15-to-25 age group had higher disposable income than initially assumed due to fewer financial commitments like mortgages and car payments.  However, it was debated whether this age group had the need for a new remote control, given the prevalence of shared or older televisions in student accommodations.  Ultimately, the team aimed to balance affordability with desirable features to appeal to a broad consumer base, including those aged 25 to 35 who might have more established homes and disposable income.\n",
    "The group views eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as the best currently available proxy for identifying pupils needing additional support, despite acknowledging its imperfections.  They recognize it may not be perfectly targeted and are exploring alternative approaches, particularly given the rollout of universal credit.  An important consideration is maintaining flexibility while ensuring funds reach the intended recipients.  While increasing the PDG time frame (similar to England\u2019s \u201cEver 6\u201d model) was discussed, it was deemed financially unfeasible.\n\nThe effectiveness of PDG on attendance and engagement for FSM pupils is seen as positive in some areas, but with room for improvement.  Initiatives like walking school buses and proactive engagement with families demonstrate PDG\u2019s potential.  However, challenges remain, especially with older students and in schools with lower FSM populations.  Concerns were raised about the significant attendance gap between FSM and non-FSM pupils, highlighting the need for further interventions to address underlying issues affecting attendance.  The group believes a multi-agency approach, incorporating support from social services and other agencies, is essential for holistic support.  Additionally, they emphasize the importance of early intervention and a focus on well-being to prevent later issues like exclusions and non-attendance.\n",
    "The professor discussed support vector machines in the context of a student's class project.  The student planned to use support vector machines for phonological feature recognition, comparing the approach to recurrent neural nets. The professor noted that support vector machines offer a more succinct representation than neural nets or Gaussian mixture models, potentially advantageous with limited training data.  They discussed how support vector machines could be adapted to generate probabilities, citing previous work by Mississippi State researchers who used a sigmoidal function to map distances to probabilities for speech recognition.  There was no discussion of support vector machines for speech rate algorithms.\n",
    "The professor advocates for adjusting scaling and insertion penalties, especially for methods employing larger time windows like LDA, KLT, and neural nets.  He believes that while back-end adjustments are typically disallowed in evaluations, any real-world user would make them. Therefore, understanding the potential improvement from such adjustments is crucial, particularly in noisy conditions. He emphasizes the importance of finding a stable operating range for these adjustments, suggesting that once a suitable range is determined, frequent tweaking becomes unnecessary. The professor also discusses the impact of feature value ranges on acoustic model candidate selection.  He proposes investigating whether observed insertions stem from incorrect value ranges, especially concerning MSG features, which might differ significantly from PLP or mel cepstrum.  He suggests analyzing substitution, insertion, and deletion rates to identify potential issues in this area.  Regarding other acoustic events, like voicing detection, the professor supports the exploration of robust features but cautions against premature fine-tuning of reports. He encourages further investigation of phonetic events, suggesting collaboration with visiting researchers Kollmeier and Kleinschmidt, who have expertise in auditory properties and brain function.  He also advises considering reverberation and its impact on performance, proposing high-pass filtering or VAD-like methods to mitigate echo and pre-echo issues.\n",
    "The team explored several UI designs for the remote.  Initially, outlandish ideas like fruit and vegetable-shaped remotes with spongy textures were discussed but quickly dismissed due to impracticality and short-lived trendiness.  The team favored designs that prioritized user-friendliness, featuring large, clearly labeled buttons. One concept involved arranging buttons in a circular pattern similar to an old-fashioned rotary phone. Another drew inspiration from the iPod's sleek, minimalist design, incorporating a scroll wheel.\n\nA key discussion point was the inclusion of a display screen.  To minimize cost, the team decided against an LCD screen on the remote itself, opting instead to utilize the television screen for displaying menus and program information.  This would allow users to navigate channels and settings using a simple interface projected onto their TV.  A central scroll wheel or four-way directional button would be the primary input method.  The team also briefly considered voice recognition but decided to limit this feature to a \"locator\" function for finding a misplaced remote.  Ultimately, the team favored a simple, intuitive design using push-button technology with a minimal number of buttons. The final button configuration and layout were deferred to a later meeting, with the user interface designer taking the lead on this aspect.\n",
    "The project manager's main concern was staying within the budget.  Initially, the team favored a rubber material for the remote's casing, but the project manager determined that plastic was necessary to reduce costs. He expressed a slight preference for a double-curved design but acknowledged single-curve was acceptable if it allowed for the LCD screen to articulate for both right- and left-handed users. He also liked the idea of a changeable cover.  While the team explored various colors, including yellow, the project manager steered the discussion toward more standard colors like white, metallic gray, or even wood-style for the basic model, with the option of consumers purchasing additional, more vibrant changeable covers.  He saw the LCD screen as a key selling point and prioritized keeping it despite the associated costs of the advanced chip. The shape of the remote was not a primary concern for the project manager, as long as it was ergonomic.\n",
    "Several system configurations were discussed, compared, and analyzed. The baseline OGI system was improved by 22%. One improvement involved running the neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than in sequence. Another potential improvement involved a second silence detection, but this was ruled out due to latency issues.\u00a0\n\nSeveral configurations using a combination of features, MLPs, KLT, and low-pass filtering were discussed. Some of these configurations showed promise, particularly in handling mismatched Italian speech data. However, the differences between the configurations were relatively small, raising questions about their statistical significance. The team planned to perform significance tests and analyze the number of words in each test set to better understand these differences. They also considered a system with a single KLT, which had not been tested yet.\n\nThe weighting scheme used for evaluation (40% for TI-digits, 60% for SpeechDat-Car) was also discussed, with a question about whether the weights were applied to percentages or raw errors. Additionally, there was discussion about when to fix the system for the evaluation, with the decision leaning towards Tuesday after receiving data from their partners. Finally, access to a server farm of ten multiprocessor IBM machines was mentioned as a potential resource for computationally intensive tasks.\n",
    "Discussions across multiple Welsh government meetings focused on the \"Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales\" draft strategy.  A key point of contention was the inclusion of targets for reducing childhood obesity, with the Chief Medical Officer advising against adopting England and Scotland's target of halving childhood obesity, citing concerns about feasibility.  The discussion explored the use of the soft drinks levy revenue to fund obesity reduction initiatives, with disagreement on whether to hypothecate the funds.  Concerns were raised regarding the current dispersion of these funds across various programs, unlike other UK nations where the funds directly support obesity initiatives.\n\nDebate arose regarding childhood obesity data collection, with some members questioning its timeliness and completeness.  Suggestions included expanding the child measurement program to include a second measurement point, similar to England.  Discussion touched on the planning system's potential role in restricting fast-food outlets near schools, and the need for community sports infrastructure in new schools. The effectiveness of current healthy eating in schools regulations was also questioned, with potential revisions focusing on sugar content.  Concerns about sufficient resources for implementing the strategy were recurring, along with the need for effective co-ordination across government and local authorities.\n  \nFurther discussion involved leveraging the planning system to restrict fast food outlets near schools and incorporating sports facilities in new school constructions.  The effectiveness of the 2013 healthy eating in schools regulations was questioned, with proposed updates focusing on sugar content. Resource allocation and inter-departmental coordination were highlighted as crucial for successful implementation.  The clinical obesity pathway review, the role of families in shaping children's health, and support for low-income families were also discussed.  Finally, the discussion touched on ensuring \"every contact counts\" by improving referral pathways and addressing staff availability issues.  A separate Canadian parliamentary session focused on the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Topics included financial aid for airlines, support for small businesses, access to medication, aid for the oil and gas industry, and the importance of high-speed internet access.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's design and functionality.  Initially, concerns arose regarding the number of functions, prompting a preference for a single-function design focused solely on television control, omitting DVD and VCR functions. This decision aimed to simplify usage and broaden compatibility with various television brands.  Teletext functionality was deemed outdated due to the increasing use of the internet.\n\nThe team explored a shift from the standard rectangular shape, seeking a more interesting and ergonomic design. A single-curved shape was favored for comfort and ease of grip.  The idea of personalization, potentially through interchangeable faceplates inspired by fruits and vegetables, was considered to enhance the remote's appeal and marketability, especially among younger demographics. However, concerns about feasibility and potential gimmicky perception led to the idea of incorporating fruit and vegetable-inspired patterns onto a more practical, ergonomic shape.  A final decision on the casing shape was not explicitly stated, though the team leaned towards a curved, ergonomic design potentially inspired by the shape of broccoli.  The team ultimately favored a more conventional shape with fruit or vegetable patterns rather than a literal fruit/vegetable shape.\n",
    "The marketing team suggested lemon/lime colors and a fruit/vegetable theme to capitalize on emerging European fashion trends extending to home decor.  Market research indicated that consumers prioritized a \"fancy look and feel\" over pure functionality. The team believed incorporating these vibrant, natural colors, along with soft, spongy materials, would align with this trend and differentiate their product from competitors who were still focused on the previous year's harder, glossier aesthetic (exemplified by the Mac iPod).  The team aimed to create a cohesive \"marketing identity\" by unifying the product's shape, materials, and color theme, using the lemon/lime concept to inspire the overall design and potentially incorporating lighting features. They felt this approach would enhance the product's \"look and feel,\" which was their primary marketing objective.  While the team discussed literal fruit shapes, the ultimate intention was to evoke the essence of these themes, not to create a remote control shaped like a lemon or other fruit.\n",
    "Market research indicates that consumers dislike the look and feel of current remote controls and are willing to pay more for a visually appealing design.  A key finding is that users primarily utilize only a small percentage of available buttons, mainly for basic functions like channel changing and power. This informed the decision to simplify the remote's functionality, focusing on core features while minimizing less-used features like teletext and extensive video programming options.  A flip-open design was chosen to house additional, less frequently accessed features. The team explored touch screen buttons as a possible solution to repetitive strain injury (RSI) and considered the ergonomic implications of remote control size for different markets.  While voice recognition was initially favored as a feature to locate lost remotes, it was deemed too expensive and ultimately replaced by a beeping function.  The final prototype features a plastic body with customizable colors and patterns, an inset LCD touch screen for added functionality, and standard buttons for core tasks.  Kinetic batteries and a single standard transmission chip were chosen to meet cost and functionality requirements.  The project remains within budget, although the team acknowledges potential added costs associated with the chosen materials and suggests a possible price increase to accommodate these and maintain profitability.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not include direct assessments of the future of institutions. However, the transcripts contain discussions on funding challenges and pressures faced by Welsh higher education institutions due to Brexit.  These include potential decreases in EU student applications, difficulties in collaborative research activities with EU partners, and uncertainty about future funding arrangements. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations and potential capital investment needs are also discussed as crucial for the sector's future.\n\nWomen's issues are raised in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate impact on women and girls, particularly regarding job losses and increased childcare responsibilities.  Members question the government's commitment to universal childcare and its approach to supporting women during the economic recovery. Concerns about the lack of gender-based analysis plus (GBA+) in COVID-19 relief programs are also expressed.\n\nThe committee's statements on housing focus on the need for affordable housing and rental assistance for vulnerable families. Members discuss the slow implementation of the Canada Housing Benefit and call for prioritizing affordable housing stimulus spending in post-COVID recovery plans.\n\nMembers' discussions cover a wide range of topics, including anti-black racism, support for the agriculture and tourism sectors, firearms legislation, veterans' disability benefits, the economic impact of COVID-19, high-speed Internet access in rural areas, and Canada's relationship with China.  Additionally, members raise concerns about transparency and accountability in government spending, the need for increased funding for the Auditor General, and support for Canadians with disabilities during the pandemic.\n",
    "The participants discussed the near completion of meeting digits recordings, noting some blanks due to absent attendees. They proposed using this data to train a digit recognizer and discussed its potential size compared to the TI-digits dataset.  They considered having transcribers extract and record the digits using provided scripts or doing it themselves, with a preference for involving the transcribers to enhance their skills and create a more complete transcript.  The process involved aligning spoken digits with their corresponding text, handling false starts and errors. They also discussed entering metadata like name, time, and date, with some debate on who should perform this task.  The group compared potential error rates with benchmarks like Aurora and TI-digits, noting the different prosodic characteristics and recording conditions.  They briefly touched upon modeling articulatory features and the challenges of accurately representing conversational speech phenomena in digit recordings. The discussion also involved using different levels of information like acoustic features and phonetic transcriptions for marking and analysis.  Finally, they explored the idea of a score-like notation for features, with potential input from John Ohala, and the desire for a versatile tool applicable to broader research beyond their specific focus.\n",
    "Marketing, the user interface designer, and the industrial designer all recommend a speech recognition interface for the remote.  Marketing believes speech recognition is a highly requested feature, especially for the 15-35 year-old demographic.  As much as 90% of that group are willing to pay more for speech recognition. It would enhance marketability in a competitive field, and provide a unique selling point.  The user interface designer recognizes the value of speech recognition as a \"marketing gimmick,\" but has concerns about ambient noise and accidental triggering of commands from television dialogue. They suggest a one-word command system to mitigate this issue.  The industrial designer agrees with the potential of speech recognition but recognizes the added cost. They suggest a user training process could lower the cost, and also propose a wireless recharging feature.\n",
    "The meetings primarily focused on education reform in Wales, specifically the implementation of a new curriculum.  There was concern about maintaining standards during this transition, particularly in secondary schools where funding deficits and teacher shortages posed significant challenges.  The new curriculum aims to re-professionalize teaching by giving educators more autonomy, but concerns were raised about the workload implications for an already stretched workforce.  While primary schools appear better prepared for the curriculum changes, secondary schools face greater challenges due to phased implementation and funding constraints.\n\nDiscussions about consortia revealed varying opinions on their effectiveness in supporting school improvement.  While some consortia demonstrated strong performance, others, like ERW (Education through Regional Work), faced challenges related to leadership, staffing, and budget uncertainties.  The Cabinet Secretary expressed a preference for school improvement advisors to be centrally employed by consortia rather than individual local authorities, citing the need for scale and consistency.  The effectiveness of regional working and the potential impact of Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from ERW were also discussed. The Cabinet Secretary emphasized the need for accountability and assurances that withdrawing authorities can adequately support their schools.  A strategic education delivery group, chaired by Professor Dylan Jones, was working to clarify roles and responsibilities within the middle tier to support curriculum implementation.  Jassa Scott, strategic director at Estyn, highlighted the need for adequate funding for local authority services supporting well-being, attendance, and behavior management.  Concerns were also raised about the time it takes for schools in special measures to improve, with secondary schools taking an average of two years.  Jassa Scott also noted that while regional consortia have improved their knowledge of individual schools, there's still work to be done, particularly in supporting digital competence and secondary school improvement.  There were no direct comments on the Auditor General.\n\nThere was no discussion of Bill Blair or firearms seizures. The political background of the meetings involved scrutiny of the Welsh Government's education policies by the Children, Young People and Education Committee. The aim was to assess the government's progress on school improvement, the effectiveness of funding allocations, and the preparedness of schools for curriculum reform.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's functions.  Initially, they focused on basic functionalities such as on/off, channel and volume control, mute, and DVD/VHS controls.  They also considered incorporating more advanced features like menu navigation and picture/sound adjustments.\n\nA key realization was the need for a lost-and-found feature.  The team proposed several solutions, including a beeping sound activated by a clap or voice command, a blinking light, and a sensor that would trigger a signal when the remote was in a dark place.  They also discussed the possibility of a charging base similar to a cordless phone, which would allow the remote to be located by pressing a button on the base.\n\nDuring project evaluation, the team decided to simplify the remote by reducing the number of buttons and focusing on the most frequently used functions. They also discussed incorporating a menu button to access less frequently used features.  The team prioritized user-friendliness and considered larger buttons and a more ergonomic design, especially for older users.\n\nBrainstorming new functions, the team explored the possibility of speech recognition, allowing users to change channels or adjust settings by voice command. They also discussed incorporating the company's color and slogan into the design, and considered a variety of shapes, colors, and materials for the remote's casing and buttons.  A key design element was the desire for a biomorphic shape that felt comfortable in the hand.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote's button colors during the finance portion of the meeting.  They determined the buttons would be in \"special colors\" and initially considered having three colors per unit.  However, to reduce costs, they decided each button on a single unit would be the same color.  The case itself would also be a special color, separate from the buttons. Marketing was dissatisfied because the scroll wheel chosen for cost savings would not appeal to their target demographic of older consumers, who would expect separate number buttons.  They felt the scroll wheel made the remote more appealing to a younger demographic and not the older consumer base they had initially targeted.\n",
    "Regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension, the Minister for Education stated a desire for resources supporting this dimension to be broad and not confined to specific subject areas.  She cited an example of integrating Welsh contributions to the computing industry within coding lessons, emphasizing a cross-curricular approach.  The discussion also touched upon ensuring resources are readily available to support the new curriculum, avoiding past issues with qualification support materials.  For the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, progression steps and achievement outcomes will be contextualized based on the medium of instruction (Welsh or English), acknowledging different learning paces and recognizing that progression may vary between the two.\n\nEmployers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate was a significant point of discussion.  ColegauCymru representatives stated that employers generally lack a clear understanding of the qualification's content and value.  The name itself was considered unhelpful, with the \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" suggested as a clearer alternative.  While larger employers with dedicated staff may be more aware of educational policy, smaller businesses often prioritize daily operations, making it challenging to stay informed about the Welsh Bac.  Some employers, once informed, expressed appreciation for the qualification, particularly its focus on skills development, but concerns were raised about the qualification becoming overly rigorous and demanding, potentially overshadowing the intended skills development.  There was a consensus on the need for a review of the qualification, emphasizing employer input to better align it with employability skills and to clarify its purpose.\n\nThe benefits of Estyn as an independent inspecting body were discussed in comparison to Ofsted in England.  While direct comparisons were avoided, the use of nominees and peer inspectors in Wales was highlighted as a unique and valuable aspect of Estyn's approach, fostering collaboration and understanding between inspectors and institutions.  The discussion also covered Estyn's practice of including school performance data in inspection reports, clarifying that this data was always present, though its presentation format evolved.  The importance of Estyn's independence was emphasized, particularly in light of ongoing education reforms, ensuring an external perspective on the system's evolution.\n",
    "The group discussed the convenience of various presentation materials. One member expressed dislike for PowerPoint presentations and felt the available information didn't align with their role, leading them to create their own materials. Another member found their materials helpful, suggesting the relevance of information depended on individual roles. The project manager noted a lack of access to certain sites limited their understanding of other members' work.  Regarding physical materials, the team found the whiteboard pens to be preferable to screen-based writing, but the microphones were considered cumbersome.  Digital tools like video recordings of meetings and transcripts were viewed as excessive for the limited information typically conveyed in meetings. Overall, the group favored traditional, tangible resources over digital ones for their project.\n",
    "The team did not explicitly decide against using LCD displays.  One team member suggested an LCD screen for menu navigation, similar to an iPod. The team discussed this, along with other interface options like scroll wheels and push buttons. Concerns were raised about the added cost and practical limitations of a small LCD screen on a remote, especially given the team's focus on simplicity and cost-effectiveness.  The discussion shifted to alternative menu display options, such as an on-screen television display controlled by the remote.  While an LCD screen wasn't ruled out, the team ultimately favored push buttons for essential functions, potentially combined with a scroll wheel for navigating more advanced on-screen menus displayed on the television.  The primary factors influencing this decision were cost considerations and the desire for a simple, user-friendly interface.\n",
    "The team introduced themselves by name and role: Heather (Project Manager), Andrew (Marketing), Craig (User Interface), and David (Industrial Designer).  They began by sharing their favorite animals and characteristics as a team-building exercise using the whiteboard.  Andrew introduced the project: a new television remote control with a target sale price of 25 Euros and a total profit goal of 50 million Euros.  The design should be \u201ctrendy\u201d and appeal to a generation that doesn\u2019t want a simple remote.  The team then brainstormed features, including addressing frustrations like lost remotes, too many buttons, and difficulty seeing buttons in the dark. Ideas included a tracking device, simplified buttons, and backlighting.  They also discussed making the remote a universal controller for multiple devices and incorporating \u201csmart\u201d features.  The team then evaluated a snowman-shaped prototype.  They discussed functionality, look and feel, and cost, using a scale of 1 to 7 to rate different aspects of the design.  They expressed concerns about the price point, given the desired features and production costs.  The team concluded the meeting by discussing the project process, noting challenges with team communication, the meeting format, and the usefulness of the digital pens and whiteboard. They suggested earlier prototyping and more collaborative brainstorming in future projects.  They also discussed alternative remote control designs, including an orange-themed line and incorporating mood lighting.\n",
    "The team discussed the possibility of rechargeable batteries or a rechargeable unit with a base station. One member suggested rechargeable Penlite batteries that could also be recharged with the remote using a wire. Another member suggested a base station for the TV where the remote could charge.  They also considered a handheld device like a PDA that could be plugged into an outlet. There was concern about the cost of these options and whether customers would be willing to pay extra for rechargeability.  One member suggested that if the rechargeable option was too costly, they could skip it and focus on other features. They also discussed the possibility of including a bay for the remote, which could look trendy and incorporate a \"bleep\" function to help locate it.  Ultimately, they decided to research the cost and feasibility of the rechargeable options and determine customer interest in such a feature. They acknowledged that for a higher price point, customers would expect something special, and the rechargeable feature could be that added value.\n",
    "The group decided to order one Crown CM311AE headset microphone to test its comfort and audio quality.  If the headset proves satisfactory, they will order additional headsets to standardize the microphones used by meeting participants.  This decision stemmed from the observation that the current close-talking microphones varied in quality and placement, introducing unwanted variability for research on dialogue, prosody, and other speech phenomena.  The nonuniformity also caused issues for transcribers.  While additional head-mounted microphones could be acquired, the group is also considering a handheld wireless microphone for participants who aren't regularly miked, due to a limited number of input channels on the recording hardware. While the existing lapel microphones remain an option, they are disfavored due to inferior audio quality.\n",
    "Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty\u2019s Chief Inspector at Estyn, expressed concern regarding the challenges secondary schools face. He noted secondary schools have a greater challenge in preparing for the new curriculum than primary schools.  He also acknowledged the financial difficulties faced by secondary schools, stating that even small decreases in funding can have a disproportionate impact, taking administrators' time and attention away from educational matters.  Rowlands stated a concern regarding teacher shortages, especially at the secondary level and in specific subjects. He suggested a two-pronged approach to address the persistent gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and their peers: improving teaching and learning, and implementing a community-focused approach to schools.  He also mentioned concerns about declining reading habits among students, advocating for fostering a love of reading whole books rather than short snippets.  He expressed optimism about progress in numeracy, attributing improvements to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy curriculum. Finally, he believed Wales was on track to meet its PISA targets, provided the current change program and new curriculum continue.\n\nKirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, discussed the challenges of reopening schools during the pandemic.  She emphasized that schools would only reopen when deemed safe by medical and scientific advisors, with no imminent plans to do so.  A phased return was envisioned, prioritizing the safety and well-being of students and staff.  Williams acknowledged the difficulties faced by vulnerable children and those with special educational needs, highlighting efforts to support them through school hubs, risk assessments, and multi-agency collaboration.  She mentioned increased funding for mental health and well-being support for students and families affected by the pandemic, including remote counseling and therapy.  Williams addressed concerns about the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers, particularly regarding access to technology, outlining plans to provide hardware and connectivity through local authorities. She also discussed vocational learners, stating Qualifications Wales had provided clarity on assessments, while acknowledging potential delays for qualifications requiring competency certificates.  Regarding A-level and GCSE qualifications, Williams explained that teachers would submit predicted grades, which would then be moderated to ensure fairness and robustness.  Finally, she discussed support for post-16 learners transitioning to college or university, highlighting online resources and career advice available through the Hwb platform.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer, Sebastian, advocated for interoperability, suggesting the remote should control multiple devices and move beyond infrared technology. He questioned relying solely on buttons, proposing alternative controls like touchscreens or joystick-style navigators for easier channel or track switching.  He also raised the possibility of incorporating a display to simplify operation and considered the trade-off between a smaller, aesthetically pleasing design and comfortable handling.  Sebastian emphasized the importance of intuitive design, allowing users to operate the remote without looking at it. He questioned the practicality of a hinged, spherical design due to its potential to be left open constantly, impacting stability. Lastly, he saw the remote's shape as crucial for comfortable full-hand use, similar to gamepads, and highlighted the need to indicate clearly which end should be pointed at the controlled device.\n",
    "The group expresses concern about the potential negative impacts of Brexit on Erasmus+ and student mobility funding. They acknowledge the value of Erasmus+ as a well-established, internationally recognized program and discuss the potential financial burden on Welsh universities if they are required to independently fund student mobility programs. While some members suggest expecting universities to commit to funding international mobility from their tuition fees, others highlight the potential cost and inefficiency of replicating a program like Erasmus+.  The group also discusses the decrease in EU student applications to Welsh universities, speculating about various contributing factors, including changes in student support arrangements, the perception of Wales as a study destination, and the level of investment in university facilities compared to English institutions.\n\nRegarding tuition fee refunds, the group primarily discusses the financial challenges faced by universities due to Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.  There is concern about the sustainability of Welsh universities given potential funding shortfalls and the need for increased investment in infrastructure.  While the potential for tuition refunds is indirectly touched upon in the context of ensuring value for students, particularly if the academic year is disrupted, no definitive stance is taken on whether refunds should be provided. The focus remains on the broader financial health of the universities and the quality of education being delivered.\n",
    "Meeting participants discussed several key issues.\n\nLocal authoritative frameworks were mentioned in the context of COVID-19 restrictions and public health guidelines.  The federal government defended its approach, emphasizing collaboration with provinces and territories, while opposition members criticized the government's actions as politically motivated and insufficient.\n\nCondolences were offered for several individuals, including Stephan Lavoie, Tristan Roy, and Richard Losier, highlighting their contributions to their communities.\n\nSeveral discussions focused on employment, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), and the Canada Summer Jobs program.  Concerns were raised about the impending end of the CERB, the accessibility of the CEWS for small businesses, and delays in confirming Canada Summer Jobs positions.  The government defended its programs, citing the number of individuals and businesses supported, while opposition members criticized the programs' effectiveness and accessibility.  The impact of the pandemic on temporary foreign workers and the need for more flexible employment insurance programs for forestry workers were also discussed.\n\nWorkers' safety was addressed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in long-term care facilities.  The Canadian Armed Forces' role in these facilities, the number of infected military personnel, and the transition to civilian support were discussed.  The need for personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline workers and the government's efforts to source PPE domestically were also highlighted.\n\nPay disputes were mentioned in the context of further education (FE) colleges, with concerns raised about the disparity between FE and school teacher pay.  The government acknowledged the issue and stated its desire for pay equality, but emphasized that negotiations were the responsibility of ColegauCymru.\n",
    "The member for Yukon expressed thanks to the House of Commons for the opportunity to speak to them from Whitehorse, Yukon.  She also thanked the Canadian Armed Forces for their report assessing conditions in five long-term care homes in Ontario.  The assessments revealed \"appalling and completely unacceptable conditions\" including residents being left to starve, being abused, and living in filth.  The reports were described as historic and prompted calls for immediate action and comprehensive reform of long-term care.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote's functions, user interface, and design.  They explored multifunctional capabilities (controlling TV, DVD, VCR) versus a simpler, TV-only device. Due to budget constraints (\u20ac12.50 production cost, \u20ac25.00 selling price) and the desire for a user-friendly interface, they prioritized a TV-specific remote.  A key innovative feature considered was voice recognition, particularly appealing to a younger demographic (15-35 years old).  However, cost and technical feasibility remained concerns. Other functions included channel and volume control, a \"find\" feature (activated by a separate device attached to the TV), and potentially a teletext button (although later deemed outdated).\n\nThe remote's design emphasized a sleek, modern aesthetic, using high-quality recycled plastic for the casing.  An LCD touchscreen interface was chosen over traditional buttons, with the possibility of interchangeable faceplates. The scroll feature was debated for menu navigation, but pressing options directly on the screen was favored for speed and simplicity.  The team also explored incorporating the company logo and colors, potentially displaying them on the boot-up screen.  A key requirement was making the remote user-friendly and intuitive, minimizing the learning curve.\n",
    "The upcoming team meeting will focus on reviewing the prototype remote control design and its functionalities.  The prototype includes an on/off button, channel and volume buttons, and a slide-out panel for advanced functions. The team decided against a touch screen and opted for multiple color outputs for visual feedback, with an option to turn this feature off.  Interchangeable faceplates with varying aesthetics are planned, including a natural look and potentially more subdued options. A voice recognition console is integrated into the back. The team will discuss the financial implications of the design, as the current prototype is over budget. They will explore options to reduce costs, potentially by removing the solar cell feature while retaining the backup battery.  The marketing lead will provide further information on the target demographic, potentially focusing on purchasing power rather than age. The team will evaluate the project process, including their satisfaction with the level of creativity and teamwork. They will also discuss any new ideas related to remote control concepts.  Finally, the group will debrief on the overall project evaluation, addressing whether the design meets functional requirements, technological goals, and desired aesthetics.  Marketing\u2019s question regarding repetitive strain injury (RSI) was answered; it refers to injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome caused by repetitive movements.  The team reflected on previous meetings, noting the need for clearer communication regarding individual roles and tasks. They also discussed the effectiveness of using digital tools and the impact of the provided information on their creativity and focus.\n",
    "Lab tests revealed user dissatisfaction with existing remote controls. Users desired a more attractive and simpler design. They primarily used only 10% of available buttons, mostly for power, channel, and volume.  The most frequently used function was channel selection. There was significant interest in voice recognition, particularly among younger demographics (15-35 years old).  Older users (65+) were less inclined to pay extra for this feature.\n\nDiscussions about the finder button focused on its practicality and implementation.  A separate transmitter, potentially attached to the television or wall, sending a radio signal to a receiver in the remote, which would then beep or flash, was the favored approach.  A button on the transmitter would activate the finder function.  Adding a light to the remote was deemed unnecessary as the beeping would suffice for location.\n\nButton design and location discussions centered on minimizing the number of buttons and optimizing their layout for ease of use.  A central, iPod-like touch-sensitive disc was proposed for channel selection, potentially incorporating volume control as well.  The inclusion of dedicated volume buttons was also considered.  The team discussed the need for a function switch to toggle between TV, DVD, and potentially VCR modes, affecting the disc's functionality in each mode.  The team agreed that the remote should prioritize television functionality, with DVD control as a secondary consideration.  Internet-related features were excluded from the current design scope.\n\nThe team agreed to exclude lighting adaptive options from the remote's functionality, focusing solely on television control.  The company's color scheme (silver and yellow) and slogan (\"We put fashion in electronics\") were to be incorporated into the final design.\n",
    "The team discussed using DAT recorders, inspired by a Santa Barbara corpus released via LDC, which employed DAT recorders and featured diverse speech styles.  They considered this corpus valuable for initial ASR model training and for potential use in far-field transcription.  The team also discussed capturing subject intentions more naturally by providing subjects with high-level task categories (e.g., \"go shopping\") and a schematic map.  Subjects would then create their own itineraries and interact with the system to complete the tasks. This approach aimed to elicit more natural phrasing and avoid subjects simply parroting pre-written task descriptions.  The team also debated the best way to represent the relationship between intentions and actions within their XML schema. They considered using \"action schemas\" (e.g., Source-Path-Goal, forced motion) linked to specific actions (e.g., enter, view, approach). The discussion revolved around how to structure these schemas, whether to represent them as flat or hierarchical structures, and how to handle cases where multiple schemas might be activated by a single utterance. The team acknowledged the need for further discussion and refinement of this representation.  Finally, regarding power cables, the team discussed plans for a new setup with a patch panel and potentially a user interface accessible during meetings.\n",
    "The group discussed several design options for the remote control. Initially, they considered a complex design with many buttons and features, including teletext, a docking station, and a small screen. However, due to budget constraints and a focus on simplicity for elderly users, they opted for a more streamlined design.  The team decided against incorporating teletext functionality due to its declining usage in favor of internet-based services.  They also decided against voice recognition, as market research indicated low demand among the target demographic of elderly users.  A key decision was to incorporate changeable cases for the remote. This would allow for greater customization and potentially attract a wider customer base. The team discussed various case materials, including wood and plastic, but ultimately chose plastic due to cost considerations.  The final design included a single-curved casing, a jog dial for navigation, and backlit rubber buttons. Although an LCD screen was initially considered, it was later removed to reduce costs. The display of advanced functions would instead be shown on the television screen.  The team also discussed the placement of the company logo and slogan, aiming to incorporate the corporate image into the design.\n",
    "Huw David expressed concern about the unintended consequences of the Bill, emphasizing the importance of careful implementation and adequate resources to avoid negative impacts. He acknowledged the existing strain on social services, highlighting that departments are already overstretched and facing increasing demands due to serious harm and neglect cases.  He stressed the need for investment in early intervention and prevention programs to support families and prevent children from being removed from their homes. While recognizing the Bill's aim to protect children, he cautioned against losing sight of the significant number of families requiring support for various reasons. He believed successful implementation hinges on a major awareness-raising campaign and the availability of support services for parents and carers, emphasizing the need for a universal offer across Wales.  He also believed that the costs associated with the Bill should be covered by the government, as it's their legislation, adding that it shouldn't come at the expense of existing services for vulnerable families.  He did not believe that the Bill should be used as a means to increase social services funding. He believed state intervention is justified to protect children from harm, citing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. He supported the Bill as a reflection of a cultural shift where physical punishment is increasingly rejected by parents. He saw the legislation as a natural progression of changing attitudes and a means to protect children's rights. He believed that with careful implementation and appropriate resourcing, unintended negative consequences could be minimized.  He believed clarifying the line between acceptable discipline and abuse is crucial for vulnerable children. Currently, the ambiguity in the law allows parents to justify physical punishment, leaving children unsure of their rights.  He believed the Bill will empower children to seek help by providing a clear definition of unacceptable behavior.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the two-sided remote control design, focusing on its unique flip functionality to cater to both basic and advanced users. One side would house simplified controls for essential TV functions, while the other would provide access to more complex features.  This design aimed to address user complaints about remotes being too complex and easily lost.  The team considered the ergonomic aspects, aiming for a comfortable, intuitive design with a minimal number of buttons to reduce confusion.  They also explored incorporating features like backlighting and beeping sounds to aid in locating the remote.  However, due to budget constraints and the project's focus on a single-device remote (specifically for TVs), the initial \"whole house\" control concept and features like voice recognition were deemed unfeasible.  The team prioritized simplicity and ease of use, acknowledging that multi-mode buttons might be too complicated for the average user.  They also discussed the importance of an attractive design to encourage impulse purchases, suggesting the use of bright colors and even different shapes to appeal to various demographics, particularly children.  The feasibility of multiple designs or interchangeable covers to cater to different user groups (elderly, children, etc.) was discussed, with cost-effectiveness being a primary concern.  While the team found the two-sided approach innovative, they also recognized potential usability challenges and acknowledged the need for further evaluation and refinement.\n",
    "Group 3's amendments centered on the Bill's regulation-making powers.  The Deputy Minister introduced amendment 3, aiming to reinstate the existing power for Welsh Ministers to create transitory, transitional, or saving provisions connected to Section 1's enactment.  This followed amendments 7 and 8, which removed the Minister's power to issue a commencement order.  Amendment 6, also introduced by the Deputy Minister, proposed that the reinstated powers in amendment 3 would come into effect the day after Royal Assent.  The Deputy Minister considered these to be technical adjustments, emphasizing that they did not grant any new powers. She highlighted that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee (CLAC), while raising procedural questions, hadn't explicitly recommended changes.  Further, she argued that the absence of a specific Assembly procedure didn't preclude scrutiny of the Minister's decisions regarding transitional powers.\n\nSuzy Davies proposed amendment 3A, a probing amendment, questioning the adequacy of the proposed powers in light of the developing complexity of the Bill.  She suggested the Minister might require broader regulation-making powers than simply transitory provisions, particularly given the inclusion of the awareness campaign and reporting requirements.  Davies expressed concern that the existing powers might not be sufficient for full implementation of Section 1, especially considering its evolution from the original draft.  She proposed amendment 3A as a placeholder, anticipating further discussion at Stage 3 regarding the scope of necessary powers.  Davies' amendment aimed to ensure Assembly oversight of any measures introduced under Section 1, advocating for clarity on whether such introductions would follow affirmative or negative procedures. The Deputy Minister agreed to further discussions on this issue before Stage 3, acknowledging potential future needs for broader powers.\n",
    "Welsh higher education institutions face significant financial pressures due to Brexit.  The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU has led to an 8% decrease in EU student applications to Welsh universities, compared to a 2% increase in England. This decline is attributed to changes in student support arrangements for EU students and the perception of better-funded facilities in English institutions.  Non-EU student applications have also decreased by 9%.  These declines exacerbate existing financial challenges, including implementing the Diamond report recommendations (which predate Brexit) and rising pay and pension costs. While Welsh institutions are developing contingency plans and exploring alternative funding sources, the continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit makes long-term planning difficult.  Current financial forecasts assume the continuation of existing EU-sourced income, but institutions are developing various scenarios to address potential disruptions.  The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) monitors institutional financial health and contingency planning, questioning scenarios that seem inadequately robust. However, they emphasize that universities are autonomous and ultimately responsible for their own sustainability.  HEFCW highlights the importance of continued investment in facilities and research infrastructure to attract students and compete for research funding.  They also work closely with the Welsh Government and UK research councils to advocate for Welsh institutions and ensure they are well-positioned to secure funding.\n\nRegarding the local production of PPE, multiple companies in Canada have retooled to manufacture surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks.  While some contracts have been canceled due to quality concerns, the government emphasizes its commitment to procuring safe and effective PPE for frontline workers.  The government states it has signed numerous contracts with domestic manufacturers, including one with Medicom in Montreal for N95 masks.  However, specific quantities and delivery timelines for locally produced PPE remain unclear.  Several MPs expressed concerns about delays in government approval for projects submitted by provinces, particularly infrastructure projects.  While the government maintains it has approved hundreds of projects and is working closely with provinces, the exact number of pending projects and the reasons for delays were not disclosed.  Finally, there was no update provided on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces.\n",
    "The Canadian government, recognizing the vulnerability of elderly citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, has implemented various support measures.  A one-time tax-free payment of $300 was provided to seniors eligible for Old Age Security (OAS), with an additional $200 for those receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), totaling $500 for the most vulnerable.  The government also allocated $20 million to expand the New Horizons for Seniors Program, facilitating services like grocery delivery and social connection initiatives.  These measures aim to alleviate the increased financial burden faced by seniors due to the pandemic.\n\nLong-term care homes emerged as a critical concern during the pandemic, with a disproportionately high number of COVID-19 related deaths occurring in these facilities.  While acknowledging provincial jurisdiction over long-term care, the federal government expressed commitment to collaborating with provinces and territories to establish stronger standards, ensuring the safety, dignity, and quality of life for seniors in care.  Discussions are underway to explore federal funding tied to enforcement and public delivery of care.  The government aims to create a more robust network of long-term care or alternative care options, prioritizing the well-being of elderly citizens.\n\nWhile not explicitly mentioned, the meeting transcripts suggest that the middle tier, likely referring to provincial and territorial governments or regional health authorities, plays a significant role in implementing and delivering services to the elderly.  The federal government emphasizes collaboration and coordination with the middle tier to ensure effective support reaches vulnerable seniors.\n",
    "The marketing expert believes the remote should have marketable features like the base station and \"find my remote\" button. They were pleased the designers included these features, stating, \"you guys gave me more than I was asking for.\" They believe the product has the right combination of features and characteristics to make it marketable and competitive.  They suggest a price point of 35-50 Euros, aiming for a sense of exclusivity rather than mass market appeal. They acknowledge the remote lacks certain features like DVD player compatibility but believe consumers will overlook these shortcomings in favor of the remote's other appealing aspects. They inquire about the possibility of making the remote upgradable for future compatibility.  The marketing expert also emphasizes the importance of aesthetics. They advise the design team to opt for silver and black colors to match most televisions. They also suggest incorporating trendy elements, such as bright colors, rubberized, spongy materials, and rounded, fruit-like shapes, to appeal to younger demographics and differentiate the product from competitors.  They believe these features would justify a higher price point, as consumers, particularly young people, are willing to pay more for unique and fashionable products. They also suggest incorporating user-specific features like personalized color schemes and usage tracking, which could be additional selling points.  Finally, the marketing expert emphasizes the importance of \"fancy\" and \"technologically innovative\" features over simple usability. They believe the product should be something people are \"proud of\" and can use to express their individuality.\n",
    "The Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was reviewed in these meetings.  The main aims of the Act were identified as regulating Welsh institutions, safeguarding public good from government funding, maintaining fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy. There were differing views on whether the Act successfully achieved these aims. The inflexibility of HEFCW\u2019s powers of intervention, described as a three-step dial from informal meetings to severe sanctions, was discussed.  The effectiveness of fee and access plans was questioned, with a preference expressed for moving towards longer-term, outcome-focused agreements. Concerns were raised about the lack of employer engagement with the Welsh Baccalaureate and the variability in how the qualification is delivered and valued by universities. The Minister maintained that the Welsh Baccalaureate is a valuable, rigorous qualification equivalent to an A-level, offering advantages to Welsh students.  The need for greater consistency in delivery and improved communication with employers and universities was acknowledged. It was noted that Universities Wales declined to provide evidence to the committee regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate. The Minister committed to exploring the committee's evidence of inconsistencies in university admissions practices.  Finally, the impact of the Welsh Baccalaureate on student workload and well-being, and the potential for it to narrow the curriculum, were discussed. The Minister stated her expectation of universal adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by institutions, while acknowledging the need for flexibility in individual cases. The importance of professional learning and teacher training to ensure high-quality delivery of the qualification was emphasized.\n",
    "The team presented and discussed evaluation criteria for their remote control prototype.  They ranked the design on a scale of one to seven (one being best) across several metrics.  The criteria included: appearance (rated six), functionality (rated two, due to lack of LCD screen and advanced chip), technological advancement (rated four, as it used push buttons), ease of use and learnability (rated between three and four due to the novel scroll wheel), R.S.I. prevention (rated between two and six), integration of fruit/vegetable theme (rated one), matching user behavior (rated one), prevention of loss (rated between three and five, relying on bright colors), simplicity (rated two), fashionable design (rated one), international appeal (rated one), and matching target demographic (rated two).  The team decided to add a company logo.  Overall, the prototype averaged a score slightly under six.\n",
    "The participants discussed using CDs for backup and archiving meeting data. They expressed concerns about the lifespan of burned CDs, noting that some had degraded within a year, while the average lifespan was estimated to be three to four years. Pressed CDs were considered more durable but still prone to degradation over time.  The consensus was to use tape for archiving, due to its reliability, and potentially supplement this with CDs for more frequent access, acknowledging the risk of CD failure.  The group considered automating the burning process to create a more efficient system.\n\nThe discussion on probability computation centered on how to combine multiple influences on decision nodes within a belief network.  They explored using weighted averages, where each influencing node (\"expert\") has an associated weight, and mixture of experts models, where a hidden variable determines which expert's input is most reliable in a given context. The challenge of specifying conditional probability tables (CPTs) for nodes with many inputs was raised, and strategies to simplify the process were discussed, including grouping similar inputs and leveraging ontological information.\n\nThe experimental setup for the computer navigation system involved a wizard-of-oz study where participants interacted with a simulated navigation system. The system would \"crash\" midway through the session, transitioning the interaction to a human operator, unbeknownst to the participant.  The setup included visual aids like a 3D model or animation of the city, and participants were informed that the system tracked their location via GPS.  The tasks involved navigating to locations with different intentions, such as buying stamps or taking pictures. The discussion touched on the type of data being collected, including far-field audio, and whether to incorporate it into the existing meeting corpus, given the distinct nature of the interaction.\n",
    "The team did not discuss symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote. However, the Project Manager suggested the creation of right- and left-handed versions of the remote due to the ergonomic design favoring right-handed users.  The team ultimately decided against this, citing the simplicity of the remote's functions and the precedent of families sharing computers with right-handed mice despite the presence of left-handed individuals. They felt that learning to use the remote with the non-dominant hand would not present a significant challenge.\n",
    "The team discussed cost reduction strategies to meet the \u20ac12.50 target.  They agreed to eliminate the speech recognition feature and restrict the casing color options.  Initially, interchangeable covers in various colors were proposed, but to reduce costs, the standard offering would have a black casing.  Customers desiring different colors could purchase separate covers.  This allowed the team to retain the popular rubberized casing material, which was deemed important for market differentiation and user experience.  The LCD screen was retained, although its functionality was not fully optimized due to budget constraints.  This compromise allowed the product to maintain a level of innovation while staying within the target production cost.\n",
    "The team discussed voice recognition as a potential feature for their new remote control.  Market research suggests there is consumer interest in this technology, particularly within their target demographic of 15\u201335-year-olds, who are considered early adopters of technology and have disposable income.  This age group also showed a high positive response to voice control in surveys.  One team member expressed concern about the reliability and cost of current voice recognition technology, citing experiences with inaccurate and expensive existing implementations.  They also questioned whether the technology is advanced enough to be worthwhile and user-friendly, suggesting it might lead to user frustration.

    "The team discussed various battery options for the remote control design. The Industrial Designer initially suggested a small lithium battery as an alternative to the standard AAA or AA batteries to reduce the remote's size. They also explored rechargeable options such as dynamo, solar, and kinetic charging. Concerns were raised about the practicality of dynamo charging and the size and durability of solar cells. Kinetic charging, similar to that used in watches, was considered a viable option due to its long lifespan and minimal user effort.  The Industrial Designer also suggested incorporating a charging station to further conserve battery life and potentially reduce the likelihood of the remote being lost.\n\nThe Industrial Designer preferred kinetic charging coupled with a watch-type battery due to its compact size, continuous charging capability, and extended lifespan. This approach also eliminates the need for users to purchase replacement batteries.  Although solar charging with standard batteries was discussed, it was ultimately dismissed due to potential added bulk and cost, detracting from the sleek and modern design.  Ultimately, the team decided on the kinetic charging method with watch batteries.  They believed this option offered the best combination of convenience, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with the desired design aesthetics. They opted not to include a charging station due to space constraints in typical living rooms.\n",
    "The meeting participants discussed submitting a paper to a conference focused on computationally motivated architectures for natural language processing. The primary reason for the paper was to document the group's work over the past six months. This documentation served several purposes. First, it provided a record of their progress and ideas, even if the paper wasn't accepted. Second, it offered a platform to introduce their new formalism, albeit briefly due to page constraints.  Finally, it allowed them to explore a specific \"where is X\" construction in detail, demonstrating the complexity of seemingly unambiguous utterances.  This focus served as a compelling argument against existing approaches to ambiguity in discourse, positioning their work as a novel contribution.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM expressed strong support for the Welsh Baccalaureate, emphasizing its value in providing a broad and balanced curriculum and preparing students for further study and employment.

She highlighted the collaborative independent review of governance being conducted by Gillian Camm, in partnership with Universities Wales and HEFCW. Williams expressed personal concerns about diversity on governing bodies, aiming for greater representation of women, BME individuals, students, and staff.  She confirmed exploring the possibility of introducing regulatory conditions for good governance in the forthcoming PCET Bill.\n\nWilliams did not express a specific stance on university mergers, stating her focus was on a healthy and sustainable HE sector. She acknowledged the potential impact of mergers on staff and students, referencing past experiences like the proposed merger between Cardiff Metropolitan University and the University of Glamorgan.  Williams indicated no current policy promoting mergers but did not rule out future considerations if deemed beneficial for students and Wales.\n\nDiscussions on admission problems in Welsh universities focused primarily on the Welsh Baccalaureate's recognition by institutions. Williams stated that Welsh universities considered the Welsh Bac equivalent to an A-level, accepting it as part of their offers. She refuted claims of disadvantage for Welsh students, citing direct engagement with Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, who confirmed the qualification's value in personal statements and interviews.  Williams acknowledged varying approaches by universities regarding offers but emphasized consistent recognition of the Welsh Bac's value. The committee, however, presented evidence of inconsistencies in how universities use the Welsh Bac in admissions, a point Williams agreed to consider further.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's design, features, and technology. They decided against incorporating fruit and vegetable patterns, opting for a more timeless aesthetic. A spongy, comfortable feel was favored for the buttons.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the remote's shape and layout, the team considered various options, including a circular design reminiscent of old telephones and a sleek, minimalist approach inspired by the iPod.  They ultimately chose a curved design that conforms to the hand, with a prominent central button (potentially the company logo or a four-way scroll button) and scroll buttons on the side.  The team decided the remote would primarily control the TV and have a locator function.  They opted against full voice control, citing potential usability issues.\n\n\nA key discussion point was the power source.  The team weighed rechargeable batteries with a charging base against smaller, disposable batteries. They ultimately selected a single lithium battery for a compact design.  For materials, a gunmetal gray plastic base with interchangeable latex covers was chosen. The initial cover would be cherry red, aligning with current trends, while future covers could adapt to changing fashions.\n\n\nThe team aimed for technological innovation while maintaining ease of use. The remote would incorporate kinetic energy charging and a lost-remote finder feature.  They considered the chip's capabilities, particularly for the voice-activated locator, and opted for a mid-range chip.  The team expressed satisfaction with the design process, highlighting the balance between creativity, individual leadership, and teamwork.  They believed the final product was fashionable, technologically advanced, and user-friendly.  The prototype received positive feedback, with minor concerns about right-handed bias.  The team felt confident they met the project's criteria, including innovation, ergonomics, and marketability.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed technical issues, energy sources, the project announcement email, and the sample sensor.\n\n**Technical Issues:** The main technical debate revolved around the remote's internal technology.  While some advocated for advanced features like voice recognition, others prioritized cost-effectiveness and simplicity, favoring basic buttons and a standard chip.  The team also discussed the inclusion of a \"find the remote\" function, possibly activated by clapping, but acknowledged potential cost and complexity concerns.  Teletext functionality was deemed outdated and excluded from the design.\n\n**Energy Source:**  Several energy options were considered, including traditional batteries, a hand dynamo, kinetic energy, and solar cells.  The kinetic charging method, combined with squeezable rubber casing, emerged as the favored choice due to its novelty and potential marketing appeal as an anti-RSI feature.  The possibility of a charging cradle was also briefly mentioned.\n\n**Project Announcement Email:** The project announcement email contained instructions for the next meeting and assigned tasks to each team member.  The email also clarified the project's target demographic (under 40 years old) and emphasized the importance of incorporating the company's image into the product design.  A pay raise, potentially linked to product profits, was also mentioned.\n\n**Sample Sensor:** A sample sensor, possibly a speaker or voice recognition component from a coffee machine project, was discussed.  However, its functionality within a remote control was questioned, and the team expressed concerns about cost and lack of practical application for television control.  The idea was ultimately dismissed in favor of more conventional button-based controls.\n",
    "The final meeting focused on evaluating the remote control prototype and the project process. The prototype included core features like on/off, channel, and volume buttons, with a slide-out panel for advanced functions. It featured voice recognition, a rubberized, \u201cspongy\u201d texture, and interchangeable faceplates. A key discussion point was the removal of the solar cell/backup battery feature to meet budget constraints. While initially conceived as a key selling point, the team decided to focus marketing on the voice recognition aspect. The prototype cost \u20ac1199, slightly exceeding the \u20ac1250 target, necessitating the removal of the solar cell feature.  The project evaluation assessed functionality, design, technology, and aesthetics. The pull-out panel\u2019s usability was initially a concern but deemed acceptable after adjustment.  The team also discussed the project process, noting the technology's helpfulness but also the drop in information flow towards the end. Some members felt limited by the provided PowerPoint slides, while others appreciated their structure.  The team debated the effectiveness of the \"concepts\" phase and whether alternative approaches would have been more fruitful.  Overall, the team felt the project was relatively productive, with room for creativity despite budget limitations.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies expressed several concerns regarding the childcare offer in Wales.  David questioned the efficacy and bureaucratic nature of yearly fee and access plans, suggesting a move to a longer-term, outcome-focused approach. He also raised concerns about the lack of graduated sanctions for institutions, noting the significant leap from informal meetings to severe penalties. He questioned whether the \u00a34.50 rate would suffice in higher-cost areas like Cardiff and Newport, worried that necessary add-on fees for food and transport would disproportionately affect low-income families.  He also highlighted the potential for a two-tiered system where wealthier families could afford additional services, creating an uneven playing field.  Irranca-Davies acknowledged the administrative burden of the current pilot scheme and expressed confidence in a centralized HMRC-type model for 2020. He defended the \u00a34.50 rate, stating it was welcomed by providers and was appropriate for the foreseeable future.  He also addressed concerns about the potential for increased charges from providers, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the scheme and the need to avoid disadvantaging low-income families.  He acknowledged the cultural and economic factors affecting demand and stressed the importance of communication with parents and providers. He defended the focus on registered providers, citing quality concerns and the educational component of the childcare offer. He also expressed confidence in the long-term capacity of the childcare sector to meet demand.  Finally, he acknowledged the need to analyze the impact of summer-born children's access to the program relative to children born during other times of the year.\n",
    "PhD C worked on online normalization, experimenting with different means for silence and speech, controlled by a voice activity detector (VAD).  They found differences in means were most pronounced for C-0 and C-1 coefficients, with C-1 exhibiting unusual behavior across varying noise types.  A variable time constant was also explored for quicker adaptation at utterance beginnings.  Additionally, white noise was added at 15dB below the utterance\u2019s maximum energy, resulting in smoother MFCCs without significantly impacting recognition accuracy.  This was attributed to a whitening effect on quieter portions.  PhD C also investigated discrepancies between systems, finding that using an LDA filter derived from clean speech significantly improved noisy speech recognition compared to a noisy-speech-derived filter.\n\nPhD F and Grad G discussed phase normalization.  PhD F initially got poor results using a long-term mean subtraction method. Grad G experimented with phase unwrapping, finding it worsened results compared to no unwrapping.  They discussed alternative approaches, including complex arithmetic and careful scaling due to the Taylor expansion of logarithms.  The optimal approach for handling average phase remained uncertain.  The professor emphasized the importance of understanding error types rather than just overall improvement or degradation, suggesting analysis by noise condition or error type (insertion/deletion).  The professor also suggested using known non-speech sections for noise estimation to isolate the impact of boundary errors and exploring additional parameters for noise characterization beyond mean and variance.  The use of a first-order vector Taylor series was also questioned.  PhD C and the professor suggested standardizing aspects like noise estimation and the number of MFCCs used.  There was no discussion of quals in relation to phase normalization.\n",
    "The meetings covered several aspects of linguistic feature detection.  One discussion focused on the frequency response of LDA filters used for downsampling feature streams.  Uncertainty arose regarding the truly important parts of the frequency response and the observation that the filters did not effectively remove very low frequencies. Online normalization was suggested as a potential solution. Another topic explored was the use of Noisy-ORs in combining multiple feature streams for improved robustness. This approach, inspired by Larry Saul's sonorant detector, uses a soft AND-OR structure with hidden variables to learn optimal weights for combining different feature streams or frequency bands. The advantage of Noisy-ORs lies in their ability to handle missing or noisy data by dynamically adjusting the contribution of each stream.  Finally, the formalization of transcriptions was discussed, including handling pronunciation variants (like \"cuz\"), acronyms, non-speech sounds, and digit groupings, along with the need for consistent tagging and glossing for downstream processing and linguistic analysis.  The development of scripts for automatically extracting and formatting data for both ASR and linguistic analysis was also mentioned.\n",
    "System involvement in demos will include visualizing prosodic features, such as sentence and turn boundaries, using Waves or Matlab.  Transcriber will be merged with THISL IR to create a more sophisticated information retrieval tool than the simple find and play function currently available in Channeltrans.  The new tool will provide hits based on keyword searches using term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency scoring and will allow users to click on hits to listen to corresponding audio segments.  The user interface will also display running transcripts and will allow searches by speaker and meeting.  Plans for Windows compatibility are under development, and there was discussion of running the system under Free BSD as a possible alternative.  Finally, system demos will include an overview of how the SmartKom dialogue manager works.\n\nA major discussion point was how to handle note-taking during meetings.  The use of CrossPads was discussed but ultimately rejected due to the cumbersome infrastructure required and the noise produced by the pen.  An alternative suggestion involved having a scribe take notes after the meeting by listening to the recordings.  Another suggestion was to use PDAs with wireless cards to allow participants to make time-stamped notes during the meeting.  A simpler version of this idea involved giving participants buttons they could press to mark specific events.  Ultimately, the professor suggested experimenting with different note-taking approaches during some meetings and evaluating their effectiveness.  He felt it was important to have a scribe take notes and create a summary, but also recognized the benefits of time-stamped live notes.\n\nDiscussions regarding backups centered on whether to store Meeting Recorder data on non-backed-up disks. Although recreatable, the professor and the system administrator agreed that the data should be backed up.  Manual backups using NW archive and the new backup system were recommended.  The main issue is timing backups with the recording of new meetings and the acquisition of additional disk space.\n",
    "Discussions regarding HMRC primarily focused on the decision to discontinue its involvement in administering the childcare offer.  Initially, HMRC was considered as a potential administrator due to its existing infrastructure.  However, several issues emerged, leading to a shift in approach.\n\nOne concern involved the Welsh language standards. While HMRC offered bilingual services, meeting the specific requirements of the Welsh language standards, particularly concerning IT systems and integration with other government platforms, proved challenging.  Technical difficulties related to incorporating Welsh characters into HMRC's systems were also raised.\n\nBeyond technical issues, a desire for greater flexibility in the childcare offer influenced the decision.  Using HMRC would have limited the Welsh Government's ability to expand the offer to include those in training and education, individuals with specific immigration statuses, and those \u201con the cusp\u201d of returning to work.  Additionally, aligning the Welsh childcare offer with the English system, administered by HMRC, could create complications if the English offer underwent changes.  Cost considerations played a role as well, with HMRC's proposed costs exceeding initial estimates.\n\nJulie Morgan supported the decision to move away from HMRC due to the desire for a more flexible and expandable system. She emphasized the importance of including parents in training and education in the childcare offer, aligning with the First Minister's manifesto commitment.  The decision also reflected the Welsh Government's commitment to invest in local authorities, keeping funds within Wales.  Although local authorities initially favored HMRC due to the reduced administrative burden, they ultimately supported the change.  The Welsh Government aims to develop a more integrated approach to early years care, with local authorities playing a central role.\n",
    "The professor suggested focusing on energy and harmonicity as features for overlap detection. The team expressed concerns about the effectiveness of log energy and suggested exploring raw energy.  They also discussed normalizing over smaller windows around overlaps, especially for backchannels.  Regarding the person in Grenada (Jose Carlos Segura), the team considered incorporating his work on Vector Taylor Series (VTS) for noise and channel compensation.  The new speaker form added a native language field, reordered the date and time fields (time first to match the order of completion), and included a variety of English regions based on TIMIT, although the \u201cNorthern\u201d region was removed due to ambiguity. An open field for accent characterization was also suggested.  The proposed belief net structure had observable features like prosody, discourse, verb choice, landmark characteristics (\u201cnice walls\u201d), context, and time of day influencing hidden variables like \"on tour,\" \"running errand,\" and \"in a hurry,\" which in turn influenced the mode (Tango, Enter, Vista). Grad B questioned the separation between observed features and output, suggesting a direct link between \"admission fee discussion\" and \"Enter\" mode. He also expressed uncertainty about the \"admission fee\" node setup and the binary nature of some features. He did not express an opinion on the overall structure, other than the uncertainty around \"admission fee.\"\n",
    "Grad E investigated the impact of using past and present frames for mean log magnitude spectral subtraction in the SmartKom system. Compared to a centered window approach, using only past frames resulted in a slight performance drop. Grad E also experimented with training models using different time lengths for mean calculation and found that training with longer periods did not improve performance if the test set used shorter time lengths.  Grad E concluded that the amount of time used to calculate the mean during training significantly impacts performance depending on the available speech duration in the test set.\n\nGrad A focused on \"cheating\" experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of intermediate categories for speech recognition. Grad A planned to manipulate the probabilities of voicing features in the LNA files within a hybrid framework, setting low probabilities for non-voiced phones. These experiments aimed to assess the importance of various phonetic categories, including inter-phoneme events, for speech recognition. Grad A intended to conduct these experiments on TIMIT and potentially extend them to digit datasets.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) team advocated for a user-friendly design, emphasizing large buttons for improved accessibility, especially for older users and those with coordination difficulties. They also highlighted the importance of intuitive navigation, minimizing the need for extensive menus or complicated button combinations. While acknowledging the potential of advanced features like speech recognition, they prioritized core functionalities such as power, channel, and volume control. They suggested these less frequently used functions could be tucked away under a cover or in a slide-out compartment.\n\nThe UI team also explored the possibility of incorporating an LCD screen, proposing layouts for various menus and functions, including channel selection and volume control. They debated the placement and orientation of buttons on the screen, considering both user habits and ergonomic factors. They also raised the question of whether to include buttons for functions like teletext, given its declining popularity due to the rise of the internet.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a single-curved, rubber remote featuring an LCD screen.  Multiple color options were discussed, including standard black, silver, and a range of \"fruity\" and \"autumn\" colors to appeal to different demographics.  The final decision regarding radio wave technology was not explicitly stated in the transcripts, although radio waves were discussed as a way to control the TV from anywhere in the house.  The extra budget was ultimately deemed unnecessary, and the team opted not to incorporate additional features if the core design met user needs.\n",
    "The professor expresses concern about noise, particularly low-frequency noise like from an air conditioner, affecting recordings made with distant microphones.  While high-pass filtering above 20 Hz helps, he emphasizes the importance of filtering before processing and notes that some software may already include pre-emphasis filtering.  He believes that the dynamic range reduction from 32 bits to 16 bits is not a significant issue. The professor also discusses reverberation, suggesting that it is best addressed with noise reduction techniques rather than \"bold new methods.\"  He also believes that the effects of reverberation are best illustrated visually by comparing spectrograms and spectral slices, since reverberation alters temporal properties and distorts formants. He notes that current visualizations do not adequately capture the impact of reverberation and suggests improvements. Regarding spectral subtraction, the professor mentions its positive impact on the relationship between speech and noise portions of C0, but acknowledges that it can increase C0 variance.  He questions focusing on spectral subtraction since another research group is already concentrating on it, and suggests exploring alternative approaches, like a tandem system using fine-structure-based probabilities, to avoid redundancy.  He points out that spectral subtraction and online normalization may not be compatible, and suggests layered application as a potential solution.  Finally, the professor suggests using a voiced-unvoiced classification in a tandem system to improve noise reduction and reduce reliance on the spectral envelope. He recommends against extending feature vectors with pitch-related variables and suggests using the Aurora dataset or a TIMIT noisy version for experimentation.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote's function as a means to send various commands to a television, such as power, channel, and volume adjustments, and potentially for other devices like CD players and video recorders.  There was debate about combining functions for multiple devices into one remote versus separate remotes for each.  The kinetic function, referring to how the remote is powered, included options like traditional batteries, a charging cradle, a hand dynamo, or solar cells.  Solar cells were deemed impractical for nighttime use. The charging cradle was favored for its novelty and potential as a unique selling point. The ability to roll through favorite channels was suggested using a scroll wheel combined with an LCD screen or indicator lights to display channel numbers.  Users would program their favorites, and the remote would cycle through them.  There was also discussion about whether a scroll wheel was cost-effective and user-friendly compared to traditional buttons.  A compromise was to use a digital scroll wheel with quantized steps, mimicking button presses, potentially combined with an LCD screen to display the selected channel.  The team ultimately leaned towards a mid-sized remote with a plastic and rubber casing, potentially with backlit buttons for mode indication or to confirm button presses.  A locator feature, activated by a button on the television or a separate device, was also considered.\n",
    "The team proposed a remote control design featuring voice recognition, a simple button layout (four directional buttons, menu button, up/down buttons), and multiple case colors in earth tones or wood stain.  They opted against a touchscreen due to cost and tabled the more complex menu options for a later model.  The design aimed for a non-traditional, sleek appearance, possibly resembling a paperweight, comfortable for handheld use and aesthetically pleasing on a coffee table.  The voice recognition feature allows operation from anywhere in the room.\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing agreed that the casing design should follow current trends, incorporating natural colors, organic shapes, and a spongy feel.  The Industrial Designer proposed various casing materials (wood, leather) and explored case designs that prevent accidental button presses, such as a flip-open cover or a lock function. Marketing emphasized the importance of an innovative design to attract consumers, suggesting the double-curved shape and rubberized casing as the most marketable options.  They also proposed marketing pilots to test consumer reception before launching the product.  The Industrial Designer was tasked with developing the basic look and feel of the remote, while the User Interface Designer was responsible for integrating the voice recognition and simplified menu options into the layout.  The Marketing team would conduct market research to identify consumer preferences and trends.\n",
    "Grad G questioned the usefulness of the pedagogical belief-net Grad A presented because it contained values instead of variables and had too many factors.  Grad G also suggested the team add the \"what's this?\" domain in addition to the \"how do I get to X\" domain to generate more interesting X-schema aspects. Grad G questioned the proposed XML structure, citing redundancy in listing both action schemas and schemas. Grad G inquired if there was an existing method to represent identity between concepts and questioned how identity would be represented in the proposed structure. Grad G was also curious about how the data structure would be used and questioned the practicality of sending the entire model in every message between modules. Finally, Grad G asked for audio samples of the data to assist in thinking of examples.  The professor agreed with Grad G's suggestion to add the \"what's this?\" domain, stating it \u201ccould\u201d be added. The professor also expressed interest in seeing how separate the intention and action components were in the system. The professor agreed that identity between concepts needs to be represented but said the referencing method was temporary until the completion of the W3C X-path specification. The professor explained that the data structure would be used for XML messages passed between modules, primarily from natural language understanding to the action planner. The professor stated that sending the entire model in every message was potentially inefficient and agreed to revisit the topic after further iterations.  Regarding Fey, the professor was pleased with her wizard-of-oz performance in the data collection, saying she did a \u201cgreat\u201d job and was \u201cmore present\u201d than expected. The professor also agreed with Grad D\u2019s suggestion to keep Fey as the wizard. The professor supported hiring Fey to organize subjects and help find additional subjects, expressing confidence in her abilities given her impending graduate school focus on experimental paradigms. The professor directed Grad D to inquire with Lila about how to add Fey to payroll.  Grad G and the professor did not discuss capturing subject intention or pronouncing zero.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer advocated for a simple, mass-produced remote control, prioritizing affordability. They expressed concerns about the cost of incorporating advanced features like speech recognition, Bluetooth, or LCD screens, especially given the target price point.  They questioned the practicality of Bluetooth given the existing infrared technology in televisions and the added cost it would represent for consumers.  While intrigued by the idea of a speech function to locate the remote, they were unsure of its cost-effectiveness. They also emphasized the importance of designing for a younger target audience who are more likely to appreciate new technologies, suggesting a touch screen interface as a possibility.  However, they also acknowledged the need to cater to older users who might be less familiar with touch screens, suggesting a hybrid approach with traditional buttons for essential functions like power, channel, and volume, and a touch screen for less frequently used features. They also suggested the possibility of using a rechargeable internal battery instead of traditional AA batteries, viewing it as a potential selling point.\n",
    "Discussions revolved around the new curriculum, teacher preparedness, and funding implications. Concerns arose regarding secondary schools' preparedness compared to primary schools, particularly due to funding deficits impacting their ability to adapt.  The committee also discussed the impact of funding on teacher training and retention, as well as the need for both long-term and short-term strategies to address teacher shortages.\n\nJassa Scott and Meilyr Rowlands agreed on the need for inspections to focus on schools at risk of concern and to ensure multi-agency support.  They also concurred that secondary schools face greater challenges in preparing for the new curriculum compared to primary schools. While acknowledging funding constraints, they emphasized the importance of sufficient resources for professional development and curriculum implementation.\n\nWhile Justin Trudeau's name appears in other meeting transcripts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does not appear in the transcripts provided, therefore, it is impossible to answer the question regarding Trudeau's statements without the relevant transcripts.  Further, the provided transcripts do not contain information about Canada's diplomatic relations, the reopening of the House of Commons, or the allocation of funds to address systematic racism.  Therefore, it is impossible to summarize these discussions based on the provided transcripts.\n",
    "The team discussed various aspects of the remote control's design.  They considered a squishy, fruit/vegetable-themed appearance, with interchangeable bases. Prototypes included a broccoli-shaped remote and a more traditional, curved design.  They debated the size and ergonomics, aiming for a comfortable hand-held feel.  A key discussion point was the incorporation of a locator button and beeper.  Technical aspects included battery placement, the type of chip to use (regular vs. advanced), and materials (plastic and rubber).  They explored different button layouts, including a scroll wheel and a simplified four-button directional pad.  A scoring system was used to evaluate the design against criteria such as \"fancy,\" \"technologically innovative,\" and \"easy to use.\"  Cost was a significant factor, with a target production cost of under 12.5 Euros. The team also discussed the design process itself, including the effectiveness of their teamwork, the available resources, and the challenges of communicating design ideas.\n",
    "The team discussed the project process, division of labor, and production plan. They expressed satisfaction with the creative freedom and teamwork, particularly in prototyping.  However, they felt somewhat limited by the company's initial constraint of focusing solely on a TV remote.  They found the digital pens, laptops, and shared network convenient, but questioned the practicality of some technologies, like recording meetings.  The user interface designer felt their role and available information were unclear, leading them to improvise. The project manager acknowledged a communication gap, being unaware of information accessible to other team members.  All agreed the product met the criteria, fitting the budget and current trends. They discussed material costs, deciding on lithium batteries and push-buttons to stay within the \u20ac12.50 limit.  Finally, they evaluated the overall process, expressing satisfaction with the teamwork and prototype creation, despite some frustrations with the initial limitations and certain tools.\n",
    "PhD D explained that training a neural network on task-specific data yielded good performance. However, training on broad data from a different task, such as TIMIT for TI-digits, resulted in a 10% performance decrease.  Using multilingual data worsened the result by another 20%. This degradation was attributed to a lack of task-specific data.  Including or excluding English from the multilingual training data did not significantly impact performance, suggesting that cross-type speech, rather than cross-language, was the primary factor.  Increasing the training data size without increasing the neural network size led to worse performance on TI-digits, possibly due to insufficient network complexity.  JRASTA features performed better than PLP in mismatched conditions but slightly worse in well-matched conditions. Regarding online normalization, PhD D initially used an approach that started recursion from the utterance beginning.  A different approach, initializing mean and variance values from the first 25 frames, yielded better results. PhD D planned to retrain networks using this improved normalization method.\n\nPhD C questioned the impact of including Finnish in training if Finnish was present in the test data.  The professor cautioned against drawing strong conclusions without good results but acknowledged that the results suggested cross-type speech was more influential than cross-language differences.\n\nThe group discussed releasing meeting data, with grad F proposing a July 15th release date and a policy of making changes only before that date.  Concerns were raised about notification, adequate response time, and the legal implications of assuming consent without explicit confirmation. Suggestions included requiring email confirmation, providing a specific deadline, and contacting non-respondents directly.  The professor emphasized the need for a documented record of consent.  The potential for numerous deletions and the need for bleeping audio were also discussed, raising concerns about disk space and version control.  Overlapping bleeps, rather than signal summation, were preferred.  The use of registered mail or certified email was suggested to ensure receipt and confirmation.  The group debated the level of effort required to obtain consent and the potential for non-response.  The professor recommended seeking legal counsel for edge cases involving unreachable individuals.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement highlights the significant gap between the development of programs and their actual implementation, specifically referencing the delay in support for single parents relying on spousal and child support.  While the Minister of Employment acknowledged the issue and promised to investigate, three weeks had passed without any concrete action. This inaction, Ms. Kwan argues, demonstrates a critical flaw in the government's response: programs are developed, but their implementation lags, leaving vulnerable populations without crucial support.  She underscores the urgency of the situation, emphasizing that these single parents and their children are struggling without necessary financial assistance.  The gap between policy and practice, therefore, has real-world consequences, directly impacting the well-being of those the programs are intended to help.\n",
    "The Project Manager seemed pleased with the overall project trajectory, expressing satisfaction with the team's presentations and prototype design. They highlighted the remote's voice recognition, non-traditional shape, and slide-out panel for advanced features as key successes aligning with the previous meeting's conclusions. The Project Manager also focused on the financial aspects, initially concerned about the prototype exceeding the target cost.\n\nReflecting on the meetings, the Project Manager felt they had effectively led the project and facilitated productive discussions. They were particularly intrigued by the incorporation of new technologies and their own performance in a project management role. They questioned why the team hadn't utilized the whiteboard more, suggesting a lack of understanding regarding its purpose.\n\nHowever, the group had differing opinions. They felt pressured by the limited time and the Project Manager's emphasis on individual tasks rather than collaborative brainstorming. The marketing representative noted a decline in information flow, receiving no instructions for the final presentation. They also questioned the effectiveness of the coaching provided, citing a lack of timely responses.  Furthermore, the group felt the project's focus shifted from serious problem-solving to superficial tasks, especially after the introduction of Play-Doh for prototyping. The limited color selection available also drew criticism.  Finally, the panther drawing was briefly discussed, considered challenging to draw, with some team members expressing admiration for the animal's attributes.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's features and their relation to key concepts.  A significant focus was on the LCD screen.  Its presence was deemed essential due to style trends and the speed of feedback it offered compared to relying solely on the television.  The team also liked the idea of a protective cover, similar to a flip phone, to shield the screen and maintain a minimalist appearance when not in use.\n\nThe inclusion of a spinning wheel, akin to an iPod's click wheel, was debated. Its functionality for menu navigation and potential integration with the LCD screen were considered, but concerns arose regarding its compatibility with a rubberized casing.\n\nPush-buttons remained important, especially for frequently used functions like channel numbers and volume.  The team felt that while the LCD offered flexibility, dedicated buttons provided a faster, more intuitive experience for core tasks.\n\nThe microphone position for voice recognition was briefly touched upon, with suggestions ranging from a prominent placement to a more discreet one underneath the device.  The material of the remote's casing was another key discussion point.  Rubber was favored for its ergonomic benefits and protective qualities, but it presented limitations for solar power.  Alternative power sources, like simple batteries or kinetic energy, were considered.  The team also explored various shapes for the remote, including flat, single-curved, and double-curved options, ultimately leaning towards a curved design for better ergonomics. Finally, the team discussed incorporating company colors, with a suggestion to use vegetable colors for the main body and company colors for the buttons.\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the Canadian tourism industry.  Provincial and international borders were closed to recreational travel, resulting in hardship for tourism operators, particularly seasonal businesses and the 1.8 million people employed in the industry.  The closure of borders to cruise ships resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, especially in Atlantic Canada.\n\nThe government implemented several measures to mitigate these impacts.  A total of $70 million was invested to offset financial losses in the tourism industry, with varying amounts allocated to different regions of the country.  The government also worked with Destination Marketing Organizations to promote local tourism.  Other programs, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Business Account, were also available to support tourism-related businesses.  The government acknowledged that more help might be needed and committed to working with industry stakeholders to develop further support measures.\n",
    "The team explored various designs for a new television remote control.  Early discussions focused on innovative features like voice recognition, a minimal number of buttons, and a unique, recognizable shape.  A long-lasting, perhaps lifetime battery was desired.  The team debated custom-designed versus off-the-shelf chips, considering cost and functionality trade-offs.  Voice control was initially favored but concerns about the technology\u2019s maturity and cost, coupled with the company's expertise in pushbuttons, led to a shift towards traditional button technology, possibly combined with limited voice control.\n\nThe team also explored the remote's physical design, considering sliders for volume and channel controls.  A mouse-like shape was suggested, prioritizing ergonomics.  Interchangeable covers, reflecting current fashion trends (like fruit and vegetable themes), were proposed to personalize the remote and encourage repeat purchases.  The company's logo would feature prominently.  A final decision regarding illumination was deferred.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a sleek, ergonomic design with a slider for volume, buttons for channels, and a power/menu button.  A long-lasting battery, a standard chip (due to time constraints), and interchangeable covers were chosen.  The remote would be designed for optimal functionality at various angles.  The team also considered the marketing strategy, emphasizing the remote\u2019s fashion-forward design and ease of use.  A simple user interface and clear instructions were prioritized.\n",
    "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) meeting is scheduled for mid-July.  A demonstration for the meeting will include the transcriber interface and a question-answering mock-up using pre-stored data.  The group is finalizing meeting information and organizing materials for DARPA.  \n\nA paper has been written that includes statistics on overlapped speech. The paper examines four corpora: Meeting Recorder, Robustness, Switchboard, and CallHome.  The amount of overlapped speech, measured in words and spurts (stretches of speech without pauses exceeding 500ms), was calculated for each corpus.  Meeting Recorder had the most overlap, Switchboard and CallHome had similar amounts, and Robustness had the least.  Backchannels were also analyzed, but removing them did not significantly change the overlap percentages. The paper also includes data on how overlap impacts recognition performance, focusing on insertion errors due to background speech.  Finally, the paper discusses \"interrupts,\" which are instances where a new sentence begins during another speaker's turn.  The paper analyzes the locations of interrupts relative to discourse markers, backchannels, filled pauses, and disfluencies. It was noted that interruptions are more likely after a discourse marker, backchannel, or filled pause.\n",
    "The group agreed to use digits and forced alignment for training.  Liz and Andreas had further information on forced alignment.  The Saturday meeting was discussed, and the group explored the possibility of a conference call, but phd f's lack of a cell phone and childcare commitments made this impractical.  The group discussed using digits recordings.  The surprising effectiveness of lapel microphones was noted, especially in controlled environments where rustling and breath noises were minimized.  The group discussed the limitations of their current HTK-based system, finding it inferior to the SRI system, especially for digits recognition.  The SRI system, trained on a larger dataset, performed significantly better, even without adaptation.  The group considered testing the SRI system on the TI-digits dataset for comparison, but noted differences in recording conditions and bandwidth.  They also discussed the importance of speaker adaptation and VTL estimation, and the potential need to modify scripts to handle speaker IDs in the TI-digits database.  They explored the potential for improving performance by adapting models to room acoustics and using wider-band data, but acknowledged limitations due to telephone bandwidth.  The group concluded by emphasizing the need for their system to handle different features, to facilitate front-end research and reverberation work.  They also discussed the cumbersome process of dumping features into individual files for the SRI recognizer.  Progress on forced alignments was also discussed. Improvements were achieved by adjusting pruning parameters and enforcing continuous foreground speech.  Challenges included handling backchannels, repeated words, and the need for ground truth alignments for parameter tuning.  The group also discussed using Waves for marking word boundaries and incorporating this into the Transcriber tool.  They considered adapting foreground and background speaker models, and using a reject phone for partial words.  Finally, they discussed comparing overlap analysis to Switchboard and CallHome, the Eurospeech submission deadline, the use of \"spurt\" as a term, the alignment process, and the importance of time-aligning overlapping speech.\n",
    "\"Triple R\" was favored over \"Triple RC\" because it was considered less redundant and visually cleaner. The team felt that \"Triple RC\" implied three remote controls, whereas \"Triple R\" was more ambiguous and potentially more marketable.\n\nThe target age group was determined to be young professionals between 15 and 35, particularly those aged 25-35. This demographic was chosen due to their higher likelihood of adopting new technologies like speech recognition and their greater disposable income for purchasing non-essential electronics like a premium remote control.  Furthermore, this age group was considered \"gadgety\" and familiar with technology. The marketing team specifically aimed at young people because they are typically early adopters of new technology.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection revolved around balancing simplicity with functionality.  The team considered a simplified interface with fewer buttons, potentially utilizing an LCD screen for less frequently used functions.  Direct channel input via number keys and the importance of \"zapping\" (quickly changing channels) were also discussed, with potential solutions including an LCD screen for numerical input or a system for prioritizing frequently viewed channels.\n",
    "Market research revealed user dissatisfaction with existing remote controls, citing unattractive design, clunky feel, and excessive, underutilized buttons.  Users desired a remote that was aesthetically pleasing, technologically innovative, and easy to use, prioritizing \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d above all. Market trends pointed towards fruit and vegetable themes in design and a preference for spongy materials.\n\nDiscussions around desired features included touch screen LCD functionality (like high-end models), macro programming for integrated device control (e.g., a single button press turning on the TV and DVD player), and gaming-centric features like joysticks and directional buttons.  A smaller, stylish, ergonomic design, possibly biomorphic, was favored.  The group also explored incorporating a \u201cfind me\u201d feature, activated by voice or a button on the TV, causing the remote to beep.\n\nDesign considerations focused on materials, cost, and power sources.  Standard button layouts, silicone PCB boards, and plastic casings were discussed as cost-effective options.  Titanium was deemed too expensive.  Power source options included standard batteries, dynamo charging, solar charging, and kinetic charging.  Kinetic charging, like that used in watches, was favored for its novelty and potential for a smaller form factor.  A dual power option (solar/standard battery) was also considered.  The inclusion of an LCD screen, potentially with a touch interface, was debated, considering cost implications and compatibility with the desired spongy feel.  A rubber sleeve over a plastic shell was suggested to offer both a tactile experience and interchangeable designs.  The group also briefly entertained the idea of a built-in mirror, inspired by mobile phone designs.\n\nRevolutionizing remote interaction involved simplifying the interface, reducing the number of buttons, and improving ergonomics.  The iPod's scroll wheel was cited as an example of intuitive design.  A flip-top design with a combination of standard buttons and a G_U_I_ (graphical user interface) was proposed.  The goal was to create a device that was both visually appealing and easy to use, moving away from the cluttered and confusing layouts of traditional remotes.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM outlined her plan for quality assurance in the post-compulsory education and training (PCET) sector, emphasizing a system of outcome agreements. These agreements, reflecting national priorities, would set clear expectations for institutions regarding their contributions.  She highlighted the importance of collaboration and cooperation across the sector, contrasting this approach with the marketization and competition seen in England.  Williams AM also stressed the need for a diverse and representative governing body within institutions.  The discussion included concerns about the effectiveness of fee and access plans, with Williams AM expressing her preference for a longer-term, outcome-focused approach rather than annual plans.\n\nBethan Owen addressed concerns about the \"high-risk\" category assigned to one university, explaining that HEFCW's risk review process helps institutions manage challenges before they escalate into crises.  She emphasized that even institutions categorized as \"medium risk\" could potentially move into the \"high-risk\" category due to financial pressures.  Owen stressed the importance of maintaining Welsh universities' attractiveness to students and continued investment in research capacity.\n\nKirsty Williams AM elucidated the five principles guiding the reopening of schools: the safety and well-being of students and staff, alignment with the broader Welsh Government pandemic response, clear communication with parents and staff, prioritizing specific groups of children for potential early access, and operational considerations like social distancing and school transport.\n\nRegarding examinations and qualifications, Williams AM explained that teachers would submit predicted grades, which Qualifications Wales would then moderate.  This process aims to provide fair grades while maintaining the robustness of the qualifications system. She acknowledged the disruption caused by exam cancellations and highlighted efforts to provide online resources and support for students transitioning to further education or higher education.\n\nAddressing doubts about the sufficiency of government actions, Williams AM defended her approach, emphasizing ongoing engagement with stakeholders and the need to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.  She highlighted her commitment to a strong and sustainable higher education sector, open to considering various options like mergers if they benefit students and Wales.\n",
    "The team expressed satisfaction with several aspects of the production process. They appreciated the freedom to make key design choices, particularly regarding the remote's technological capabilities and fashionable appearance. They found the collaborative model-making process enjoyable and valued the availability of advanced tools like digital pens and a shared wireless network.  However, they felt their creativity was somewhat stifled by the company's initial constraint of designing solely a TV remote.  One team member expressed concern about the product's limited functionality, questioning the market for a dedicated TV remote.\n",
    "The SRI system uses mean subtraction as a channel normalization technique.  One participant theorized that this gave the HTK implementation a boost not seen in the SRI system because the SRI system already performs channel adaptation.  The finer-grained acoustic models in HTK could be more sensitive to artifacts in re-synthesized audio, which sometimes exhibits an echo.  One participant noticed that mean subtraction makes PZM signals louder after re-synthesis and questioned if it acted as a gain control, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.  It was clarified that simply increasing signal amplitude wouldn't have an effect unless the signal-to-noise ratio improved.  Another participant suggested that the absolute energy used by the system has some dependence on signal level.  Subtracting the mean log spectrum is akin to dividing by the spectrum, so a small number in the estimate could be amplified.  There was discussion about whether normalization was missing or if the signal was actually larger in practice.  The SRI system's use of tied-state triphone models and various adaptations, such as conversation-side normalization for non-C-zero components, was also noted as a difference from other systems.\n",
    "The group discussed mixed signals primarily in the context of voice activity detection (VAD) and speaker overlap.  They explored the challenges of accurately classifying overlapping speech, particularly in noisy environments like the SpeechDat-Car dataset.  VAD improvements centered on using noise-compensated MFCCs and an LDA filter, which resulted in a 53.66% performance gain but introduced a 220ms latency.  Attempts to reduce this latency by adjusting delta window size and online normalization placement were discussed, aiming for a sub-200ms target.  VAD results showed improved performance in well-matched and medium mismatch conditions but worse performance in highly mismatched scenarios, particularly with increased deletions.  Adding a tandem neural network worsened the highly mismatched condition, possibly due to increased silence probability estimates.  Alternative methods like using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy-based VAD were explored to address latency, but consistent thresholding across datasets proved problematic. Postdoc A\u2019s opinions on the new headphones were positive, with transcribers preferring them, but the postdoc noted they were not ideal for the task.  Increasing space was a concern, with plans to archive Broadcast News data to free up disk space for approximately four more meetings, providing a temporary solution before acquiring more disks.  Finally, the deadline discussed was July 15th for the initial data release, with concerns raised about appropriate notification and consent procedures for meeting participants.\n",
    "Special schools will be utilized as part of the new purpose arrangement to provide safe and secure locations for children of frontline workers.  Additionally, special schools will continue to serve vulnerable children, including those with additional learning needs. The Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for looked-after children is now managed on a regional level by regional consortia, rather than being allocated directly to individual schools. This change aims to provide more strategic use of resources and address the issue of funding not transferring when a looked-after child moves schools. While individual schools may still receive PDG allocations for looked-after children, the regional consortia play a key role in overseeing the distribution and use of these funds, as well as providing capacity building and support for the system as a whole.  This approach is intended to ensure a more consistent and effective use of resources to support the educational attainment of looked-after children.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer introduced the remote control prototype by demonstrating its ergonomic design and button layout. They explained the placement of the scroll wheel for volume, channel buttons, and the oversized power button. They also highlighted the infrared section and the protective cover.  The User Interface designer added details about the materials, suggesting lightweight plastic for the body and a rubbery material for the cover, similar to iPod covers. They also mentioned the company logo placement.\n\nDuring the discussion about making the remote universal, the team explored lengthening the remote so it could stand vertically, allowing for additional logos and accommodating multiple devices.  The Marketing representative suggested it could have different uses, like controlling a stereo or DVD player.  However, the primary focus remained on its use as a television remote.  The team also discussed a numbering system for accessing channels beyond ten, involving a plus button and numerical input.  The universal aspect seemed to revolve around its functionality rather than language accessibility, as the team decided against incorporating multiple language options on the remote itself.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer described the prototype remote as blue with multicolored buttons, easily fitting in the hand with all buttons accessible.  They highlighted the use of strong plastic for the case, soft rubber for the buttons, and a fluorescent green LED. They emphasized the comfortable tactile experience of the soft buttons and the practicality of the overall design, especially for one-handed use. The Industrial Designer also mentioned the international market, agreeing with the need for symbols on the buttons rather than language-dependent text.  They suggested incorporating text directly onto the case.  Finally, the Industrial Designer championed the voice recognition feature and the remote's practicality as key selling points.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not provide specific details regarding the allocation of $75 million toward sexual exploitation and human trafficking.  While Vecchio repeatedly asks about the funding, Freeland and Chagger do not provide clear answers about where the money has gone, only that hundreds of organizations have received support. They state that more information will be forthcoming.\n\nThe transcripts offer insights into HEFCW's approach to risk appetite within Welsh universities.  They emphasize a system of checks and balances where HEFCW plays a role in reviewing institutional proposals, especially regarding borrowing, to ensure prudence.  While universities are autonomous, HEFCW intervenes when necessary, offering an external perspective to mitigate potential risks.  Their risk assessment model considers various factors, including financial pressures, and they acknowledge the potential for increased risk profiles in the sector due to financial constraints.\n\nHon. Chrystia Freeland's perspective on systemic racism is addressed indirectly.  She acknowledges the existence of systemic racism, particularly against Indigenous peoples, and highlights the importance of addressing it.  However, the discussion primarily focuses on government actions and policies rather than her personal views.  She emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach involving various levels of government and stakeholders to tackle this issue effectively.\n",
    "The segmenter, developed by Thilo, is now performing well, with high recall, though precision may be lower due to over-generation.  The team is considering using the automatic segmentations as the basis for speech recognition, moving away from hand-segmented data.  This shift is expected to improve the handling of noise and other artifacts, but will require retraining or adapting existing noise models.  The team also discussed using the segmenter\u2019s posterior probabilities to enhance the process.  There are plans to create ground truth speech/non-speech labels from existing transcriptions to further refine the segmenter.  Overall, the automatic segmentation is viewed as a significant time saver despite occasional inaccuracies, especially with short utterances.  It was noted that a record of any manual adjustments to the automatic segmentations would be useful for analysis.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer did not disagree on the price. The marketing team raised concerns about the price exceeding the budget during the financial review after the interactive evaluation. They noted the LCD display would significantly increase the cost.\n\nThe User Interface Designer expressed concern about the lack of redesign time *after* product evaluation, not during it.  They worried a product flaw discovered after release would prevent a second generation product.\n\nThe User Interface Designer favored yellow and black, the company colors, for the first prototype.  The team agreed.  In the second meeting, the team discussed a customizable wood case and also mentions green. The final prototype uses yellow and red. The transcripts do not offer a clear reason for the change to red, although the marketing team suggests red in the first meeting.\n\nThe marketing team and User Interface Designer did not disagree on the product's shape.  The final prototype shape resulted from budget constraints requiring the removal of the scroll wheel and reverting to a simpler, less curved shape.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil believe the Welsh baccalaureate in its current form does not effectively prepare learners for employment.  They question whether employers understand the qualification, citing feedback from employer boards and expressing concern that the focus on outcomes and paperwork overshadows the development of practical skills.  While they acknowledge the initial vision for the Welsh baccalaureate was sound, they feel it has lost its way, becoming overly rigorous and bureaucratic. They suggest the qualification needs review, with greater employer input to ensure employability skills are prioritized.  They also point to other successful programs, such as Career Ready and WorldSkills, that engage employers more effectively and better prepare learners for specific industries.  While acknowledging some value for A-level students seeking university admission, they question its relevance for vocational learners, citing instances where alternative qualifications or programs like WorldSkills are more highly valued by employers.  They believe the Welsh baccalaureate attempts to be \"all things to all men,\" struggling to meet the needs of both university-bound and vocationally-oriented learners. They advocate for a reassessment of the qualification's purpose and a return to its original vision, prioritizing skills development over paperwork and outcomes.\n",
    "The team discussed several additional functions and design elements for the remote.  A central idea was the inclusion of a \"locator\" or \"homing\" function, activated by a button on a charging cradle, causing the remote to beep when misplaced.  This addresses the common consumer problem of losing the remote.  Another key addition was a scroll wheel for channel selection, offering a more intuitive and potentially \"snazzy\" user experience than traditional buttons.  A cradle for the remote, doubling as a charging station, was also proposed.  The team debated the inclusion of a \"trigger\" button on the underside of the remote, but ultimately tabled it due to a lack of a clear essential function and concerns about accidental activation.  Finally, the team considered incorporating speech recognition, driven by consumer interest in advanced technology and potential accessibility benefits for users with disabilities.  However, concerns about the technology's maturity and cost were also raised.\n",
    "The Project Manager emphasized the financial constraints of the project, stating the selling price target of \u20ac25 and the maximum production cost of \u20ac12.50. They highlighted the importance of achieving a \u20ac50 million profit and capturing the international market, primarily Europe and North America.  They questioned the feasibility of incorporating high-tech features given the cost constraints.  The Project Manager acknowledged the need to balance innovative features with user-friendliness, particularly for diverse user groups and cultures. They stressed the importance of originality and trendiness to attract consumers.\n\nRegarding the proposed features, the Project Manager questioned the feasibility and cost implications of an LCD screen and a multi-device functionality, emphasizing the need to maintain a reasonable price point.  They also questioned the necessity of a number keypad, suggesting its integration into the menu system accessible via the LCD screen and joystick. While open to innovative design elements like articulation for ambidextrous use, the Project Manager also expressed concerns about potential structural weakness and favored a robust design.  They proposed using standard, cost-effective components like lithium-ion batteries and plastic or rubber casing. The Project Manager championed the company's branding by suggesting incorporating the company logo and signature yellow color into the remote design. Finally, the Project Manager defined the target market as a broad demographic, excluding perhaps only the oldest generation, and suggested product evaluation through user testing and field trials.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) believed the target price of 25 Euros was ambitious considering the desired features and a maximum production cost of 12.50 Euros.  They questioned the cost-effectiveness of including voice recognition, especially given the lack of specific customer demand for this feature. UI emphasized the importance of prioritizing core functionalities like channel browsing, volume control, and an intuitive layout, especially for a product in this price range.  They also highlighted the need to balance innovation with cost, suggesting that advanced features like voice control could be reserved for a higher-priced \"business class\" version.  Regarding kinetic batteries, UI did not explicitly express an opinion, but their focus on customer priorities implied that standard batteries might be a more practical choice.  Overall, UI advocated for a user-friendly design that met customer needs while remaining within cost constraints, even if it meant sacrificing some of the more ambitious features.\n",
    "The disagreements between Marketing and the Industrial Designer stemmed from differing priorities regarding product features and overall design philosophy. Marketing favored an upgradable product to accommodate future technological advancements and expand product lifespan.  This approach prioritized long-term market appeal and customer retention. However, the Industrial Designer expressed concerns about added complexity.  They argued for a simpler, more user-friendly design, prioritizing immediate usability and intuitive functionality over future upgradability. The initial product, targeting an older demographic, was meant to be straightforward and easy to operate.  Adding upgrade capabilities would necessitate more buttons and features, potentially complicating the user experience.\n\nThis difference in perspective also manifested in the discussion of kinetic energy. While the User Interface team initially suggested kinetic energy as a power source, Marketing questioned its practicality for the target demographic, suggesting it might be perceived as cumbersome.  The Industrial Designer ultimately disregarded the kinetic energy option due to the necessity of a display screen, which would consume more power.  The final design opted for solar cells and a docking station, a decision driven by a combination of cost considerations and Marketing's desire for a unique selling point.\n",
    "Discussions revolved around HEFCW's powers concerning interventions, focusing on their efficacy and suitability for the evolving higher education landscape in Wales. HEFCW expressed concerns about the inflexibility of their powers, describing them as \"threatening\" and difficult to use for swift interventions.  They noted a preference for informal measures, facilitated by the small size of the sector, but acknowledged challenges in scaling this approach to a larger, more diverse tertiary education system.  Concerns were also raised that the existing framework didn't adequately address issues such as poor governance, inconsistent regulation between established institutions and private providers, and the complexities of transnational education.  The Minister acknowledged these concerns and indicated that the forthcoming PCET Bill would seek to address them.  This includes exploring options for more flexible regulatory powers, including advice and guidance, enhanced monitoring, and the possibility of introducing regulatory conditions related to good governance. The Minister also highlighted the importance of collaboration and cooperation within the sector, contrasting the Welsh approach with the marketization and competition seen in England.  Discussions with stakeholders, including Universities Wales, HEFCW, and chairs of universities, are ongoing to inform the development of the new legislation.
