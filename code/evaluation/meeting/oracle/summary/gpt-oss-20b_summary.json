    "The group agreed that a number of practical changes were required before the next session could be run smoothly.  First, the professor would need a head\u2011mounted cell\u2011phone so that he could participate in a conference call while driving; the team also decided to switch to a lapel mic that was positioned closer to the speaker\u2019s mouth and to use a far\u2011field microphone when the data were collected in a larger room.  Second, the forced\u2011alignment procedure had to be re\u2011tuned \u2013 the pruning thresholds were relaxed, a reject model was added, and the alignment script was modified to accept the new speaker\u2011ID format that the TI\u2011digits database uses.  Third, the front\u2011end was changed from a full\u2011band to a telephone\u2011band filter to match the acoustic conditions of the recording room, and the acoustic model was adapted to the new data.  Finally, the group decided to run a small pilot with the SRI tandem recogniser on the same data set to verify that the adaptation was working as expected.\n\nRegarding the language of the discussion, Professor\u202fB made it clear that all technical exchanges \u2013 especially those involving the IBM computer system and the data\u2011collection participants \u2013 should be conducted in English.  He argued that the IBM hardware and the Aurora data set are both English\u2011based, and that using English would keep the conversation consistent for all participants, many of whom are native English speakers or are already working with English\u2011language corpora.  In short, the group\u2019s changes focused on equipment, alignment, and acoustic modelling, while the professor insisted on English as the lingua franca for the IBM\u2011computer and data\u2011collection discussion.",
    "The team spent much of the session unpacking how the **user model** and **situation model** should feed into the belief\u2011net decision nodes, and they converged on a practical representation for the user\u2019s **budget**.  They agreed that budget is a distinct part of the user state that is *not* a belief\u2011update variable but an externally\u2011updated numeric or categorical value (cheap, average, spendy, or a continuous money amount).  The budget node would sit in the user state sub\u2011network and be updated whenever the user spends or earns money, and its value would influence the probability that the user will choose to \u201cgo there\u201d or \u201center\u201d a location that has a cost.  The group noted that a simple true/false \u201cgo\u2011there\u201d node is insufficient; the decision must consider whether the user is willing to pay, which depends on the budget.  They also discussed a higher\u2011level **compatibility** node that aggregates budget with other user\u2011state factors (time, energy, interest) to determine overall readiness for an action.  In the belief\u2011net, the budget node would feed into the compatibility node, which in turn would influence the endpoint decision nodes (enter, view, approach).  The discussion highlighted the need to keep the budget representation simple enough for efficient inference while still capturing its dynamic nature.  Finally, they agreed that the budget\u2019s numeric changes will be handled outside the belief\u2011net, with the net receiving updated values as a new evidence input.",
    "During the special committee\u2019s hearings the floor was dominated by a debate over the \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d that the pandemic has placed on the Canadian economy and the measures the federal government has taken to address it.  Members asked for a clear, timely economic update and for a full disclosure of the costs of the emergency package.  The government\u2019s response was to point to bi\u2011weekly reports on the total cost of the plan, the expansion of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the wage\u2011subsidy program and the large\u2011employer emergency financing facility, and to promise a comprehensive fiscal update as soon as \u201cclear economic projections\u201d were available.\n\n**Cathy\u202fMcLeod** was sharply critical.  She called the lack of an economic update \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coutrageous,\u201d arguing that Parliament and Canadians deserve a transparent picture of the fiscal situation.  McLeod demanded that the government publish an update and that it stop \u201csidelining\u201d Parliament.\n\n**Mona\u202fFortier** defended the government\u2019s approach.  She reiterated that the Finance Minister had already been reporting bi\u2011weekly on the cost and status of the measures, and that a full update would be provided as soon as projections were ready.  Fortier portrayed the government\u2019s actions as \u201copen and transparent,\u201d while acknowledging that the timing of the update was still pending.\n\n**Mr.\u202fGabriel\u202fSte\u2011Marie** was more skeptical of the package\u2019s design.  He complained that the large\u2011employer emergency financing had conditions that did not address tax\u2011avoidance or tax\u2011evasion, and that the government was not taking a firm stand against abusive tax practices.  Ste\u2011Marie urged the government to tighten eligibility rules and to scrutinise the use of emergency funds more closely.",
    "In the discussion the industrial designer, Xavier, briefly sketches a tiger and the team comments on its attributes. The industrial manager (project manager) picks up on several of those traits as potentially useful for the remote\u2011control design. He notes that the tiger \u201chunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well\u2011thought way.\u201d This emphasis on a deliberate, methodical approach is taken as a cue for a product that is intuitive and purpose\u2011driven. He also highlights the tiger\u2019s \u201cbig, strong\u201d nature, suggesting a robust, reliable form that users can trust. Finally, the manager points out the tiger\u2019s \u201csecurity\u201d and \u201chide\u2011spot\u201d instincts, interpreting this as a desire for a design that can conceal itself when not in use and offers a sense of safety or privacy to the user. In short, the industrial manager sees value in the tiger\u2019s strategic hunting, its sheer strength, and its stealthy, protective behavior, and thinks these qualities can inform a remote\u2011control that is powerful yet discreet, thoughtful yet dependable.",
    "The team expressed a mix of frustration and pragmatic optimism about the current Transcriber interface.  The main complaints were that it loads waveforms slowly, makes it difficult to switch between channels, and does not allow transcribers to see or edit overlap boundaries in a fine\u2011grained way.  Because the interface only shows a single mixed waveform, transcribers often have to listen to each channel separately, which is time\u2011consuming and can lead to missed overlaps.  Several members suggested a more \u201cmusical\u2011score\u201d style interface that would display multiple channels on a single timeline, making start\u2011and\u2011end points for overlaps explicit.  One postdoc mentioned that a custom interface developed at the Munich lab could show eight channels simultaneously, but it was not released publicly.  Another suggested using Praat or Xwaves, which can display multiple waveforms, though they also suffer from slow scrolling when many channels are shown.\n\nIn terms of alternatives, the group looked at existing tools from CMU and the Munich team.  The CMU tool could handle eight channels and was praised for its visual clarity, but it was not open\u2011source.  The Munich system was noted for its ability to pre\u2011segment speech/non\u2011speech but was considered too error\u2011prone for the meeting data.  Overall, the consensus was to keep using Transcriber for the short term while exploring a hybrid solution\u2014perhaps a lightweight wrapper that pre\u2011loads channel waveforms and allows quick visual inspection\u2014so that transcribers can efficiently mark overlaps and other fine\u2011grained events.",
    "**Summary of the three presentations**\n\n**Component design & materials** \u2013 The team reviewed the core parts of a new remote: a plastic or rubber\u2011lined case (single\u2011 or double\u2011curved), push\u2011buttons (with optional scroll wheel), a PCB with a simple/regular/advanced chip, and a power source (standard AA, kinetic, or solar). Titanium was discussed but rejected for cost/compatibility reasons. Rubber provides a \u201cspongy\u201d grip; plastic gives a cheap, sturdy feel. Color schemes were split into fruit/vegetable hues for youth and dark, classic tones for seniors.  \n\n**Market findings** \u2013 User surveys (Paris/Milan trend\u2011watch) showed that the top priority for all ages is a fashionable look, followed by ease of use. Young consumers gravitate toward bright, spongy materials and LCD displays, while older buyers prefer wood\u2011like or dark\u2011colored finishes. Functionally, the most\u2011used buttons are channel and volume controls; other functions (menu, parental lock, voice recognition) are \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have.\u201d  \n\n**Conceptual UI specifications** \u2013 The interface should have only the essential four buttons (power, channel, volume, menu) with optional scroll wheel for advanced menus. An LCD screen is optional; a small on\u2011screen display can show channel titles or settings, but many argued that an external TV display is sufficient. Voice\u2011recognition is a high\u2011tech add\u2011on but may inflate costs.  \n\n**Remote components** \u2013 The remote will contain a simple PCB, a basic or regular chip (depending on LCD use), a standard AA battery or kinetic charger, and a rubber\u2011lined, curved case. Optional features include a scroll wheel and an LCD.  \n\n**Trend watching** \u2013 The team agreed that the next\u2011year trend is \u201cfancy look and feel.\u201d This translates into fruit/veg color palettes, spongy textures, LCD screens, voice\u2011recognition, and kinetic charging. Parental\u2011control menus were flagged as a potential market differentiator.  \n\nIn short, the group settled on a cost\u2011effective design that balances a trendy, rubber\u2011lined case with essential push\u2011buttons, a simple chip, and optional LCD/scroll wheel, while keeping an eye on the rising demand for voice\u2011control and kinetic power.",
    "The early implementer pilot, launched in seven local\u2011authority areas, has proven to be a \u201clearning\u2011by\u2011doing\u201d experiment that has already highlighted key administrative, cultural and capacity issues that will shape the wider roll\u2011out.\n\n**Administrative burden** \u2013 Parents are required to produce wage slips, birth certificates and other documents to prove eligibility. The process is labour\u2011intensive for both families and local authorities, especially when eligibility is tied to complex work patterns. The minister emphasised that a single, centralised system \u2013 modeled on the HMRC \u201ctax\u2011free childcare\u201d account \u2013 would be far simpler and would shift the paperwork from parents to the state.\n\n**Demand is uneven** \u2013 In some rural or high\u2011cost areas, demand is high and parents are eager to join; in others the pilot has not yet reached the community, creating a \u201cwait\u2011list\u201d effect. This unevenness has taught that a phased, geographically diverse expansion is safer than a big\u2011bang launch.\n\n**Cultural factors** \u2013 In parts of South Wales, grandparents and extended family already provide unregistered childcare. The pilot revealed that many families rely on this informal care, and that a formal offer must be communicated clearly so parents see its value and do not feel forced to abandon existing arrangements.\n\n**Capacity and workforce** \u2013 The pilot has exposed gaps in both physical space and skilled staff, especially in Welsh\u2011medium provision. Lessons point to the need for targeted capital investment and a 10\u2011year workforce plan to meet local shortages.\n\n**Communication and integration** \u2013 The experience underscored the importance of a robust communication strategy that links the Welsh offer to the UK tax\u2011free childcare scheme, ensuring parents use the correct payment channels and avoid double\u2011charging.\n\nOverall, the pilot has shown that a phased, centrally supported, and well\u2011communicated rollout, with built\u2011in flexibility for high\u2011cost areas, will be essential to delivering a robust, equitable childcare offer across Wales.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) was very clear that the remote\u2011control concept had to stay within tight cost limits (\u2248\u202f12\u00bd\u202f\u20ac per unit) and that any \u201cfancy\u201d technology would have to be justified by a measurable benefit.  \n**Speech / voice recognition** \u2013 The PM repeatedly dismissed this idea. He cited the lack of maturity of the technology, the difficulty of training a limited\u2011vocabulary system, the background noise from the TV, and the extra cost of microphones and processing. He concluded that voice recognition would add little functional value and would not fit the 25\u202f\u20ac price target.  \n**LCD / display** \u2013 The PM also ruled out an LCD. He argued that an on\u2011remote screen would drive the bill of materials and power consumption beyond the budget and that the TV\u2019s own interface could serve the same purpose. He suggested that any display would be a later optional feature, not part of the baseline product.  \n**Button design** \u2013 The PM advocated a very minimalist button layout. He wanted only the core functions (power, channel, volume) and a small joystick or scroll wheel for navigation, with perhaps a single menu button. He was open to a \u201cturbo\u201d button for fast channel jumps but insisted that the total number of physical controls be kept to a minimum to reduce cost and complexity.  \n**Overall technology stance** \u2013 The PM stressed that while the market wants new technology, the product must remain simple, reliable, and inexpensive. New tech (LCD, voice, advanced sensors) was to be excluded unless it could be incorporated without pushing the unit price above the target. In short, the PM\u2019s vision was a low\u2011cost, low\u2011feature remote that delivered the essential TV functions with a clean, ergonomic design and no unnecessary bells and whistles.",
    "During the meeting the team spent a large portion of time debating how best to standardise the acoustic capture of their impromptu conversations and whether to add a visual component.  The main audio\u2011convention points were:  \n\n* **Microphone type and placement** \u2013 the group agreed that the close\u2011talking lapel mics should be the same model and worn at the same distance from the mouth (about a thumb\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half away, angled to avoid breath noise).  They decided to replace the current Sony wireless mics with a uniform set that is more comfortable and reliable, and to move the wired mics to wireless where possible.  The plan is to keep at least one channel per speaker and to time\u2011align any additional channels with the mixed signal.  \n* **Channel count and beamforming** \u2013 while the team discussed the possibility of a full microphone array, the consensus was that the extra channels would add complexity and disk space without much benefit for the short, close\u2011talking data they are collecting.  They will therefore stick to a few channels (four or six) and use post\u2011processing to isolate speakers.  \n* **Recording workflow** \u2013 the audio will be recorded continuously and the data will be time\u2011aligned before transcription.  The group will keep the recording pipeline simple, avoiding full\u2011scale array capture unless a dedicated researcher takes the lead on it.  \n\nRegarding video, the team acknowledged that a number of external partners (e.g., NIST, LDC) have already instrumented rooms with cameras, but none of those rooms are currently recording.  The discussion highlighted the additional legal and human\u2011subjects burden that video would impose \u2013 consent, privacy, and the need for a robust data\u2011handling policy.  Consequently, the decision was to **not add video to the current recording regime** but to keep the option open for future projects where the benefits outweigh the costs.  In short, the group will standardise the microphone setup, keep the audio\u2011only recordings for now, and defer video until a clear need and proper infrastructure are in place.",
    "The team\u2019s discussion on project finance and the drawing board was largely about keeping the remote\u2011control design within a strict \u20ac25 price point while still achieving a \u20ac50\u202fmillion profit target.  The project manager opened by reminding everyone that all design choices had to fit the financial limits and that any \u201cgimmicks\u201d (sample speakers, fancy back\u2011lights, or a locator) would need to be justified against the cost budget.  A quick cost audit was carried out, noting that the scroll\u2011wheel and push\u2011buttons were the cheapest interface options, while the LCD display and sample speaker were the most expensive.  The team agreed to remove the sample speaker and the extra locator to stay under budget, and to keep the scroll wheel (or two separate up/down buttons) as the primary volume control.  They also discussed the possibility of using a cheaper rubber or wood\u2011colored shell instead of titanium or custom finishes.  Throughout, the project manager emphasized that any feature added must be evaluated for its cost\u2011benefit ratio and that the finance section would re\u2011check the final bill of materials.\n\nThe drawing board was used as a live brainstorming and decision\u2011making tool.  Each member was encouraged to sketch key concepts (e.g., the flip\u2011open shape, the banana\u2011like silhouette, the speaker placement) on the board while the group discussed feasibility and cost implications in real time.  The board helped capture quick iterations of the user interface layout, button placement, and color schemes, allowing the team to visualize how design changes would affect both usability and cost.  By drawing directly in the meeting room, the team could immediately see trade\u2011offs, ask questions, and reach consensus on which features to keep or drop before finalizing the prototype.",
    "During the discussions the **Industrial Designer** repeatedly emphasized the look, feel and ergonomics of the remote.  He argued for a \u201cfancy\u201d aesthetic with special\u2011colored buttons, a rubber or spongy finish, a curved case, and the inclusion of kinetic\u2011energy or voice\u2011recognition features.  He kept revisiting the idea of a single\u2011curved shell, a small LCD screen, and a \u201cfruit\u2011print\u201d theme that would appeal to younger users.  When cost constraints surfaced he was willing to drop the special colour, simplify the button layout, and use a standard plastic case, but he still wanted to preserve the overall \u201cfancy\u201d look and a degree of innovation.\n\nThe **Project Manager** focused on the business side: a 25\u202f\u20ac retail price, a 12.5\u202f\u20ac production cost target, and a 50\u202fmillion\u202f\u20ac profit goal.  He repeatedly reminded the team that any feature added must not push the unit past the cost ceiling.  He decided that infrared signalling and a battery were the simplest, most reliable power and communication options.  He ruled out Bluetooth, extra sensors, or a large LCD unless they could be trimmed down to fit the budget.  He concluded that the prototype should keep a single curved case, standard plastic, no special\u2011colored buttons, and a basic button set (volume, channel, menu, power).  The PM also agreed to evaluate the prototype against the set criteria (fancy, innovative, user\u2011friendly, corporate identity, and cost) and to keep the remote universal and simple enough for the target market while staying within the financial limits.",
    "The team approached the remote\u2019s base as a multi\u2011criteria decision problem.  First they listed all material options \u2013 plastic, latex, rubber, wood, titanium \u2013 and then asked how each would satisfy three key criteria: ergonomics, fashionability, and cost.  They agreed that a spongy, latex\u2011covered base would feel \u201csoft\u201d and match the current fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable trend, while a simple plastic body would keep the price under the \u20ac12.50 target.  The discussion moved to shape: single\u2011curved, double\u2011curved, banana\u2011shaped, or a generic \u201corganic\u201d silhouette, with the conclusion that a single\u2011curved, ergonomic form would be most user\u2011friendly.  They also debated whether to include a rechargeable stand; the consensus was that a base that could double as a stand and recharge would add perceived value but would raise the cost, so it was kept as a future option.\n\nWhen evaluating fashionability, the team used their market survey data, which showed that 58\u202f% of respondents preferred a \u201cfancy\u201d look over a purely functional one.  They therefore decided to use bright yellow latex with a subtle fruit\u2011inspired pattern, keeping the brand logo visible on the side.  This choice was reinforced by the desire to avoid the \u201chard clicky\u201d feel of traditional plastic remotes and to align with the organic, spongy aesthetic that was trending in Milan and Paris.\n\nThe pros and cons of existing remotes were mapped out in a pros\u2011cons table.  Pros: large, tactile buttons; intuitive layout; low cost; widespread battery use.  Cons: cluttered interfaces, lack of fashion, many remotes use LCD screens that are unnecessary for a TV\u2011only remote, voice\u2011recognition adds cost, and traditional plastic bodies feel dull.  By weighing these against the new design\u2019s ergonomic, fashionable, and cost\u2011effective attributes, the team settled on a spongy, single\u2011curved plastic base with a bright, fruit\u2011inspired finish and a minimal button set, leaving more advanced features (LCD, voice) for a future premium model.",
    "The team spent most of the meeting debating how to make the new remote both **environment\u2011friendly** and visually appealing for a young, trend\u2011sensitive market.  \n**Eco\u2011friendly material** \u2013 They explored shape\u2011memory alloys that would allow the remote to \u201csnap\u201d apart at the end of its life, kinetic and solar batteries, and a latex or rubber \u201cspongy\u201d outer skin that would give a soft, ergonomic feel.  The pros of the shape\u2011memory alloy were easy disassembly and recyclability, while the kinetic battery was praised for its zero\u2011maintenance appeal.  The latex option was questioned for protecting the internal electronics but was still favored for its grip.  \n\n**Current trend** \u2013 The design brief called for a fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable theme with bright primary colours and a \u201cspongy\u201d touch.  Marketing highlighted that fashion watchers in Milan and Paris are already favouring fruit\u2011shaped, colourful, and soft\u2011touch devices, and that consumers are willing to pay a premium for a \u201cwow\u201d look.  \n\n**Potential materials** \u2013 Hard plastic for the base, titanium or aluminium for a strong frame, wood for a premium feel, and latex for the outer skin were all considered.  The team decided to keep the core case in a durable plastic and to layer it with a thin latex coating for the tactile surface.  \n\n**LCD screen** \u2013 The group debated whether to mount a small LCD on the remote or to rely on the TV\u2019s on\u2011screen menu.  An on\u2011remote LCD would require an advanced chip and add cost, but would give instant feedback; an on\u2011TV menu keeps the remote simple but forces users to look away from the screen.  The consensus was to use a minimal LCD for basic channel and volume indicators only.  \n\n**Colour** \u2013 Primary colours tied to fruit themes (e.g., lemon\u2011yellow, strawberry\u2011red, blueberry\u2011blue) were agreed as the default palette, with the possibility of interchangeable covers.  \n\n**Spongy material** \u2013 Latex was chosen as the primary \u201cspongy\u201d material because it is inexpensive, provides a good grip, and can be molded into a soft, curved case that feels comfortable in hand.  \n\n**Material\u2011function issue** \u2013 The team highlighted the tension between a soft, attractive exterior and the need for robust, long\u2011lasting buttons and a durable internal structure.  They resolved to use a hard plastic core with a latex coating, and to keep the button housing in a sturdy metal or reinforced plastic.  \n\n**Questionnaire** \u2013 Finally, the group agreed to design a short questionnaire for potential users to rate preferences on colour, sponginess, button layout, battery type, and the desirability of an LCD display.  The results will inform the final material selection and feature set.",
    "**Remote\u2011control prototype introduction**  \nThe Project Manager opened the meeting by stressing the budget constraint (12\u202f\u20ac\u202f50c) and the need to keep the design within that limit. He then briefed the team on the prototype: a banana\u2011shaped, spongy\u2011rubber case with a minimal button layout (channel, volume, power, menu, a few toggle keys) and an optional small LCD that can display channel information and battery status. The User Interface designer explained the button logic (six core keys plus a toggle that switches the remote\u2019s function between TV and DVD modes) and highlighted the speech\u2011recognition module and a small LED for locator feedback. The Industrial Designer added that the case would be a flexible, translucent material that could glow or light up when a button is pressed, and that a removable cover could be added for style or protection.\n\n**Multi\u2011functional vs single\u2011functional stance**  \nThe group largely agreed that a single\u2011functional TV remote would be simpler, cheaper, and easier to market to a broad age group. The multifunctional idea (TV + DVD + VCR + teletext) was dismissed because it would push the prototype beyond budget and complicate the user experience. The consensus was to keep the remote focused on TV control, with optional voice\u2011recognition and a locator feature.\n\n**Lower grades in the technological aspect**  \nThe prototype received lower technology scores because it relied on a basic infrared chip and a simple LCD, lacking the advanced features (e.g., full\u2011screen display, Wi\u2011Fi connectivity, or a high\u2011resolution touch interface) that competitors were starting to offer. The team noted that while the design was innovative in shape and tactile feel, it did not meet the \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d criterion of the evaluation rubric, hence the lower marks.\n\n**Locator consideration in functional requirements**  \nDuring the discussion the locator was identified as a key usability feature. The User Interface designer proposed a small LED that lights up when the remote is pressed or when the user activates a \u201cfind me\u201d button on the TV. The Industrial Designer suggested integrating a low\u2011power Bluetooth beacon or a small speaker that emits a distinctive tone, making the remote easy to locate in a dark room. The locator was agreed to be part of the final functional spec, as it directly addresses user pain points highlighted in the user survey (remote loss) and aligns with the \u201ceasy to find\u201d evaluation criterion.",
    "PhD\u202fA and PhD\u202fC converged on a few key points about how to treat the variance of the acoustic signal and the role of the energy feature in overlap detection.  Both agreed that the raw log\u2011energy curve is too flat to separate speakers when two people talk at once; the logarithm compresses the dynamic range and makes it hard to see the \u201cstep\u201d that would signal a second voice.  They also noted that the standard trick of subtracting a long\u2011term mean and dividing by a long\u2011term standard deviation in the log domain is not a good solution either, because it assumes a Gaussian distribution that the data do not satisfy.  Instead, they suggested experimenting with shorter, moving windows for the mean/variance estimate, and even varying the window length (e.g., 200\u202fms as a minimum, but sliding to capture the onset of an overlap).\n\nDuring the discussion with Jose, the two PhDs highlighted that Jose had been looking at log\u2011energy and had already been varying the window size and testing the effect of different normalizations.  They agreed that Jose\u2019s experiments were a useful starting point for evaluating whether a simple energy\u2011based cue can still work when the signal is properly windowed and the variance is estimated per speaker rather than globally.\n\nThe overlap problem emerged as the most difficult issue.  All of the participants noted that overlap is highly variable: back\u2011channel \u201chuh\u201d or \u201cyeah\u201d utterances often do not change the energy at all, whereas true simultaneous speech does, but the effect is muted by the log transform.  Because the system cannot reliably determine which speaker is overlapping, the variance estimates become unreliable and the energy cue is unreliable.  In short, PhD\u202fA and PhD\u202fC agreed that variance\u2011based normalization must be local and adaptive, that the log\u2011energy trick is problematic, and that overlap detection remains a hard problem that will require richer features or a more sophisticated model.",
    "The team spent a large portion of the meeting debating the extra delay that the mean\u2011subtraction and smoothing stages introduce. Professor\u202fC expressed a clear concern that any added latency would make the SmartKom system feel unresponsive to users. He pointed out that the smoothing recursion used to estimate the running mean is not purely causal \u2013 it looks ahead a few frames, which inevitably adds a delay. The discussion noted that the recursion required roughly **five\u2011hundred milliseconds** of look\u2011ahead to settle into a steady\u2011state estimate, a figure that Professor\u202fC highlighted as a major contributor to overall latency.  \n\nIn addition to the smoothing delay, the baseline system already incurs about **two hundred milliseconds** of buffering. The 24\u2011frame buffer that feeds the front\u2011end, with each frame roughly 10\u202fms long, produces a 240\u2011ms latency before the first frame is processed. When the smoothing delay is added, the total end\u2011to\u2011end latency can reach **250\u2013300\u202fms**. Professor\u202fC was particularly worried that such a delay would degrade the conversational quality of the system, making it feel \u201claggy\u201d for real\u2011time voice queries. He stressed the need to keep the latency \u201cas low as possible\u201d and suggested exploring ways to overlap the smoothing with other processing steps or to reduce the look\u2011ahead window.  \n\nThus, the main points of the discussion were:  \n1. **Smoothing recursion delay (~0.5\u202fs)** introduced by the mean\u2011subtraction algorithm.  \n2. **Baseline buffering delay (~0.2\u202fs)** from the 24\u2011frame input buffer.  \n3. The combined latency (~0.25\u20130.3\u202fs) was the professor\u2019s primary issue, as it could make the interactive system feel sluggish.",
    "The User Interface team presented a prototype that combines several new features with clear usability and marketing advantages.  \n\n**Introduced features**\n\n1. **Ergonomic wooden case** \u2013 a lightweight yet substantial wood body with a biomorphic shape that can be stained in any colour, allowing full customisation.  \n2. **Flip\u2011panel LCD screen** \u2013 a small, optional LCD that can be toggled on the flip panel for menus or off for a pure button experience.  \n3. **Large, prominent on\u2011off button** \u2013 placed in the centre for easy thumb reach.  \n4. **Soft, raised tactile buttons** \u2013 a numeric pad, volume, mute, channel\u2011control, and a dedicated voice\u2011recognition toggle, all symbol\u2011labelled for international use.  \n5. **Integrated voice\u2011recognition** \u2013 a microphone positioned on the side (not under the flip) so it remains exposed even when the remote is closed.  \n6. **Optional hand\u2011dynamo/jog\u2011wheel** \u2013 a small energy\u2011harvesting wheel that can charge the internal battery or power the LCD.  \n7. **Customisable backing** \u2013 a detachable rear panel that can be replaced or painted to match user preference.  \n8. **LED status indicators** \u2013 fluorescent\u2011green LEDs for menu, channel, and power status.  \n\n**Advantages**\n\n- **User\u2011friendly reachability** \u2013 all controls are within thumb\u2011reach and can be operated with one hand, making the remote comfortable for all ages.  \n- **Versatility** \u2013 the optional LCD allows power\u2011saving mode or full visual control, giving flexibility for different user needs.  \n- **Customisation and branding** \u2013 colour and backing options enable a personalised product that can be marketed as a premium, design\u2011centric item.  \n- **Cost efficiency** \u2013 the prototype stays below the \u20ac12.5 budget (actual cost ~\u20ac9.95), with the LCD optional to keep the unit within the target price point.  \n- **Future\u2011proofing** \u2013 the hand\u2011dynamo concept and modular back panel allow easy upgrades or additional features without redesigning the core form.  \n- **Market differentiation** \u2013 voice\u2011recognition and a unique biomorphic shape set the product apart from conventional remotes, supporting the marketing narrative of convenience and style.  \n\nOverall, the detailed design delivers a sleek, functional, and customizable remote that balances tactile ergonomics with modern tech features while remaining cost\u2011effective.",
    "**Presentation**  \nThe team presented a banana\u2011shaped remote control that is double\u2011curved, ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the hand. The core body is titanium (or a titanium\u2011colored plastic alternative) with a spongy texture to avoid slipping. Two scroll wheels (one for channel, one for volume) sit on the top, a \u201cturbo\u201d button allows fast channel skipping, and a small logo is embossed on the front. The remote includes a detachable base station that powers the unit, provides a location\u2011finding beep, and can host optional modules.  \n\n**Discussion**  \nA key debate centered on material choice: titanium offers durability but drives cost, while a titanium\u2011colored plastic would reduce price and still give the desired look. The team weighed the addition of an LCD display and a speech\u2011recognition module against the cost ceiling of \u20ac12.5 per unit. They concluded that the LCD would increase complexity and price, and the speech module would add only marginal value for the target youth market. Usability for left\u2011handed users was also discussed, leading to the decision to keep the design right\u2011handed but consider a mirrored variant later. Battery life, charging method, and the optional base\u2011station were agreed upon, as were the ergonomic \u201cturbo\u201d button and the minimal button layout.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nTwo prototype versions were agreed upon:  \n\n1. **Basic Banana Remote** \u2013 titanium body, two scroll wheels, turbo button, no LCD, no speech recognition, priced at \u20ac12.5.  \n2. **Advanced Banana Remote** \u2013 same shape, but with an LCD display and optional speech\u2011recognition module, higher cost, aimed at a premium segment.  \n\nThe team will build these prototypes, conduct a questionnaire\u2011based evaluation, and refine the design before moving to mass production.",
    "During the meetings the team wrestled with several core design choices that would shape the new remote while staying within a tight cost envelope.  \n\n**Touch\u2011screen** \u2013 The idea of a small touch display was floated as a \u201cbuzz\u2011feature\u201d but the engineering estimate of \u20ac17.5 per unit far exceeded the \u20ac12.5 target price.  Because the extra cost would push the retail price to roughly \u20ac25, the consensus was to drop the touch screen and focus on a simpler interface.  Voice\u2011recognition, already available in\u2011house, was seen as the more affordable high\u2011end feature that could be delivered without the touch\u2011screen\u2019s cost burden.  \n\n**Flip\u2011screen / flip\u2011top** \u2013 A flip\u2011up panel was proposed to hide secondary controls and provide a small LCD for menu or recording prompts.  The benefits were clear \u2013 a cleaner look, protection of buttons, and a place for a battery\u2011level light \u2013 but the extra weight and the need for a more complex hinge mechanism threatened the budget.  The group decided to keep the flip\u2011top as a design option but to limit it to a simple, lightweight hinge that could be manufactured from the same material as the outer shell.  \n\n**Battery** \u2013 The standard AAA cells were rejected for being bulky and short\u2011lived.  Alternatives discussed included a rechargeable lithium pack, a solar\u2011charged unit with a backup battery, and a \u201csolar\u2011plus\u2011backup\u201d hybrid that would satisfy the \u201cno power outage\u201d requirement while keeping the cost down.  The final plan was to use a small rechargeable pack that could be recharged via a USB port, eliminating the need for frequent battery replacement.  \n\n**Flip\u2011top design** \u2013 The shell was agreed to be a double\u2011curved, ergonomic shape that could house the buttons on the front and a small LCD on the flip\u2011top.  The material would be a hard\u2011plastic with a rubberised edge for grip, avoiding the expensive titanium or rubber options that had been ruled out.  \n\n**Budget & functionality** \u2013 The team settled on a core set of functions: power, channel, volume, a menu button, and voice\u2011control.  All other features were considered \u201cnice\u2011to\u2011have\u201d and would be deferred to a future model.  By eliminating the touch screen, simplifying the battery, and using a single, lightweight flip\u2011top, the design stayed within the projected cost while still offering a distinctive, user\u2011friendly remote.",
    "The Government says it has drawn several key lessons from the three\u2011year Schools Challenge Cymru programme and is now applying those insights across the wider school\u2011improvement agenda.\n\n**Key lessons**\n\n1. **Evidence\u2011based, targeted interventions** \u2013 Schools that used the pupil development grant (PDG) for proven approaches such as growth\u2011mindset training, attachment\u2011disorder support and whole\u2011school behavioural frameworks saw the greatest impact. The programme highlighted the need for clear evidence of effectiveness before funds are spent.  \n2. **Leadership and capacity building** \u2013 Strong, accountable leadership was identified as the single most important driver of change. The investment in regional consortia \u2013 including the transfer of senior challenge advisers into the consortia \u2013 was seen as a lasting legacy that will sustain the intensity of support.  \n3. **Systems of tracking and data** \u2013 Early years of the scheme were hampered by a lack of pupil\u2011level tracking. The review underscored the importance of individual tracking and the use of tools such as the Sutton Trust toolkit, prompting the government to consider a Welsh\u2011specific toolkit.  \n4. **Consistency and continuity** \u2013 The transition from a time\u2011limited programme to a broader regional model was designed to preserve momentum. The Government stresses that the \u201cfade\u2011out\u201d was managed through formal hand\u2011over events, continued funding for key personnel, and the establishment of a school\u2011categorisation system that now allocates 25 days of support to schools in need.  \n5. **Inclusive focus on vulnerable pupils** \u2013 Lessons around the need for a multi\u2011agency approach for looked\u2011after and adopted children were taken seriously, leading to new regional PDG advisers and a stronger partnership with social\u2011services bodies.\n\n**Current progress**\n\n- The programme has closed, but its legacy lives on: 39 schools that were in the scheme now operate under the new categorisation system, with several moving from red to green and others exiting special measures.  \n- The regional consortia now cover all schools, not just secondary ones, and the new PDG regional advisers are actively challenging schools on the use of grant money.  \n- Estyn reports from 2017 show three of the four consortia making strong progress on vulnerable\u2011pupil support, and the government is continuing to monitor and refine the system.  \n- The Government remains committed to applying the evidence\u2011based practices identified by Schools Challenge Cymru throughout the national mission, while also addressing gaps such as the need for more robust tracking and the integration of best practice across all schools.",
    "Dr\u202fDavid\u202fBlaney acknowledges that Brexit has introduced significant uncertainty for Wales\u2019 higher\u2011education sector, but he stresses that the impact is not uniformly negative and that the sector is largely \u201cmanaged\u201d in its response. He points out that the most visible effect so far has been an 8\u202f% fall in EU\u2011domiciled applicants to Welsh institutions \u2013 a trend that he attributes mainly to the temporary disruption of the EU student grant and the shift to a fee\u2011based model. Blaney cautions that this dip is likely to be \u201crelatively temporary\u201d once the new arrangements settle and that the broader picture will depend on how the UK\u2011EU relationship evolves.\n\nBlaney also highlights a second, more structural, reason for the drop: Welsh universities have historically invested less in campus facilities and marketing than their English counterparts, which makes them less visible in a highly competitive international recruitment market. He notes that, beyond the funding issue, prospective students often choose a destination based on perceived quality, safety and support. In this regard, he argues that Wales offers distinct advantages: a comparatively lower fee level, a reputation for safety and a supportive, community\u2011focused learning environment. He stresses that the \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d programme is designed to showcase these strengths, aiming to counterbalance the perception that Welsh universities are less attractive simply because of lower investment levels. In short, Blaney sees Brexit as a challenge that must be navigated with strategic investment and targeted marketing, but he remains confident that Wales can still attract international students by emphasising its safety, affordability and the quality of its higher\u2011education experience.",
    "The group\u2019s discussion framed **mental spaces** as *contextual sub\u2011worlds* that a speaker can instantiate and manipulate during an utterance.  Each space is a **domain** that contains a set of facts, entities, and relations that are temporarily \u201cactive\u201d for the discourse.  In the meeting the participants identified several types of domains:  \n\n1. **Temporal domains** \u2013 past, present, future, or relative time markers such as \u201cin France\u201d or \u201cbefore the speech time.\u201d  \n2. **Spatial domains** \u2013 concrete locations or imagined places, e.g., \u201cthe castle,\u201d \u201cthe museum,\u201d or the more abstract \u201clandmark\u2011ness\u201d of a place.  \n3. **Discourse\u2011history domains** \u2013 a stack of previously mentioned mental spaces that carry over facts (e.g., whether the admission fee was discussed, whether the place is closed).  \n4. **Situational or task domains** \u2013 the agent\u2019s plan or goal (e.g., \u201center the building,\u201d \u201ctake a picture,\u201d \u201cgo to the bus stop\u201d).  \n\nThese domains can be nested or overlapped, and a given utterance can refer to multiple of them simultaneously.\n\nThe **middle layer** is conceived as the interface that links observable linguistic cues (the top block of features) to the deeper semantic representation (the bottom block).  It functions as a set of *latent variables* that mediate between what the parser sees (e.g., lexical items, syntactic structures, discourse markers) and the ultimate meaning specification.  For example, the top layer might provide evidence that the speaker used the word \u201center\u201d and that the discourse has already mentioned a \u201cclosed\u201d status.  The middle layer would then infer hidden variables such as **tourist status**, **hurry level**, or **intentionality** (e.g., \u201cplan to enter\u201d), which in turn constrain the bottom\u2011level semantic bindings (e.g., the event type, participant roles, and temporal relations).  \n\nThus, the middle layer acts as a probabilistic, inference\u2011based bridge that turns surface evidence into a structured mental space, enabling the system to reason about how different domains interact and to generate a coherent semantic representation of the utterance.",
    "The professor\u2019s remarks about the system\u2019s back\u2011end and data storage were two separate but related concerns.  \n\n**Back\u2011end**  \nHe repeatedly pointed out that the current back\u2011end is \u201cfairly simple\u201d but that \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with it.\u201d  The implication is that the architecture is adequate for basic operations, yet it lacks the robustness or sophistication needed for the more demanding recognition and segmentation tasks that the team is tackling.  He stressed the need to revisit the back\u2011end design, identifying the specific flaw and updating the implementation so it can support the new forced\u2011alignment, digit\u2011reading, and recognition experiments that are being discussed.\n\n**Storing data**  \nThe professor was very pragmatic about the data\u2011storage strategy.  He noted that the team is running out of space on the existing disk pool and suggested adding a high\u2011density tape drive for archival purposes.  His plan is to keep raw data on non\u2011backed\u2011up disks, then perform a single, dedicated backup onto tape\u2014ideally using the tape robot but without interfering with the nightly backup schedule.  He also discussed the possibility of archiving onto CD\u2011ROM or DVD for distribution, but cautioned that these media degrade over time, so tape is preferred for long\u2011term preservation.  Finally, he emphasized using a consistent directory tree with clear naming conventions (user IDs, session IDs) so that all tools, including the Meeting Recorder suite, can locate and process the data without additional bookkeeping.  In short, the professor wants a simple but reliable back\u2011end and a disciplined, tiered storage system that balances capacity, durability, and accessibility.",
    "The committee\u2019s debate on the seniors\u2011care crisis was dominated by the stark reality that over 80\u202f% of COVID\u201119 deaths occurred in long\u2011term care (LTC) homes.  Members demanded federal leadership, with the Prime Minister acknowledging that while LTC is a provincial jurisdiction, the federal government would \u201csupport the provinces\u201d and work toward national standards that would \u201cremove profit from the long\u2011term\u2011care system.\u201d  The government\u2019s response was framed as a partnership with provinces, a call for a full public inquiry into the failures highlighted by the Canadian Armed Forces\u2019 report, and a pledge to strengthen provincial oversight.  \n\nRacism was linked to LTC through the observation that for\u2011profit facilities have disproportionately poor outcomes for Indigenous and racialised seniors.  The Minister of Public Safety was asked to commit to a comprehensive review of RCMP use of force, and the government pledged to address systemic racism in policing while also working to eliminate profit\u2011driven models in LTC.  \n\nAmendments to workers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 rights were highlighted in the context of bankruptcy reform.  The government has amended the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to protect workers\u2019 severance and pension rights, and the Minister of Justice confirmed that the new provisions will ensure that bankruptcy proceedings do not wipe out pension entitlements.  \n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay voiced that the Veterans Affairs ministry is \u201clistening to veterans and families\u201d and that the federal government is committed to improving policies and programs that support veterans, reflecting a broader commitment to veterans\u2019 welfare.  \n\nFinally, the Minister of Seniors outlined pandemic assistance: a one\u2011time tax\u2011free $300 payment for OAS recipients and $200 for GIS recipients, an extension of OAS/GIS deadlines, and support for community\u2011based projects through the New Horizons for Seniors program, all aimed at providing immediate financial relief and quality\u2011of\u2011life improvements for seniors.",
    "The three key stakeholders \u2013 the Project Manager (PM), Marketing and the Industrial Designer \u2013 found themselves at odds because each brought a different set of priorities to the table, and those priorities clashed on almost every major design decision.\n\n**Cost versus feature set**  \nThe PM\u2019s main concern was the \u20ac25 target price and the need to hit a 50\u2011percent gross\u2011profit margin while delivering a product that could be shipped worldwide. Marketing, on the other hand, pushed for a \u201cfashionable\u201d look, interchangeable face\u2011plates, bright primary colours and an LCD screen \u2013 all of which would drive up unit cost. The Industrial Designer argued that a more complex shape (double\u2011curved, rubber or plastic) and additional mechanical elements (a wheel, a touch\u2011screen bezel) would also increase cost and production risk.\n\n**User experience versus brand identity**  \nMarketing insisted on a \u201cstand\u2011out\u201d visual identity \u2013 a bold colour palette, removable covers, and a \u201clog\u2011on\u201d style parental\u2011control menu \u2013 to appeal to younger buyers and reinforce Real Reaction\u2019s brand. The Industrial Designer counter\u2011argued that a softer, ergonomically\u2011shaped remote with a single curved profile and a subtle LED\u2011backlit button set would be more intuitive for the majority of users, especially older or less tech\u2011savvy customers. The PM tried to mediate by insisting on a simple button layout (channel, volume, mute, power) that would satisfy the market while keeping the design straightforward.\n\n**Technical feasibility versus market trends**  \nMarketing pushed for cutting\u2011edge tech such as voice recognition, an LCD display and wireless operation, citing consumer hype. The Industrial Designer warned that integrating these features would complicate the design, raise power consumption and lengthen development time. The PM was caught in the middle, trying to balance the \u201cmust\u2011have\u201d tech with the need to meet the timeline and budget.\n\nIn short, the disagreements stemmed from a classic clash of objectives: the PM\u2019s focus on cost and schedule, Marketing\u2019s focus on trend and brand differentiation, and the Industrial Designer\u2019s focus on ergonomics, manufacturability and technical feasibility. Each stakeholder\u2019s perspective was valid, but aligning them required a compromise that would satisfy all three dimensions.",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation as a structured, quantitative review that would be carried out immediately after the prototype presentation.  They adopted a simple 1\u2011to\u20117 scoring system (1 = fully meets the criterion, 7 = does not meet it) and then calculated an average score for each feature.  The evaluation was broken down into a set of criteria that reflected both market strategy and user\u2011experience goals:\n\n1. **Look and feel** \u2013 aesthetic appeal, ergonomic shape, and tactile quality.  \n2. **Innovation** \u2013 presence of new technology or unique functions (e.g., speech\u2011recognition, docking station, kinetic power).  \n3. **Ease of use / learnability** \u2013 how quickly a new user can operate the remote, button layout, and intuitive controls.  \n4. **Target demographic fit** \u2013 suitability for the intended age group (20\u201140\u202fyrs, older users, etc.).  \n5. **Fashion / trend alignment** \u2013 incorporation of current style cues (fruit\u2011themed colours, interchangeable covers).  \n6. **Functional completeness** \u2013 coverage of essential TV functions (channel, volume, mute, teletext) and optional extras.  \n7. **Cost/price\u2011value** \u2013 alignment with the \u20ac25 selling price and \u20ac12.50 production budget.  \n8. **Brand identity** \u2013 recognisable logo, colour palette, and corporate image.  \n9. **Safety / anti\u2011theft** \u2013 features such as a locating LED or alarm.  \n\nMarketing used these criteria to rate each prototype, discuss the scores, and decide whether the design met the budget and market\u2011positioning objectives.  The evaluation process was meant to be quick, objective, and directly tied to the company\u2019s motto and the latest fashion trends in consumer electronics.",
    "**Current status of transcription, recordings, and intermediate categories in relation to the SPG schema**\n\n- **Recordings** \u2013 As of the latest meeting, the project has captured roughly **30\u201335\u202fhours** of audio, including both meeting\u2011recordings and digit\u2011reading sessions. The recordings are stored in a multi\u2011channel format (six wired microphones, with plans to replace the remaining wired mics with wireless units). The team has begun a routine of checking for \u201cspikes\u201d and other audio artefacts and is working on a systematic procedure for adding a second, distant microphone channel to improve speech\u2011vs\u2011noise separation.\n\n- **Transcriptions** \u2013 **Approximately 12\u202fhours** of the recorded material have been transcribed by the current pool of transcribers. The transcription workflow is being refined: a spell\u2011checker is now run against each transcript, and a filter\u2011based post\u2011processing step automatically flags numbers, acronyms, and non\u2011vocalized events (e.g., coughs, door slams) for manual review. The team is also experimenting with a web\u2011based review interface that lets participants flag passages for \u201cbleeping\u201d or removal, in accordance with the consent\u2011form policy. The goal is to have all 30\u201335\u202fhours transcribed and cleaned before the next DARPA milestone.\n\n- **Intermediate categories (SPG schema)** \u2013 The SPG (Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal) action schema has been formalised in XML, with separate \u201cEnter\u201d, \u201cView\u201d, and \u201cApproach\u201d sub\u2011schemas. A new \u201cAction\u2011Description\u201d layer has been added to capture richer intent information (e.g., \u201cbuy a cuckoo clock\u201d vs. \u201cgo to a bakery\u201d). The team has agreed that each action instance will include a source, path, goal, and an optional richer description that can be linked to the SPG schema. The schema is now being integrated into the natural\u2011language\u2011understanding pipeline: the parser will output SPG\u2011annotated structures, which the action planner will consume. A prototype mapping between the SPG schema and the current \u201cSource\u2011Path\u2011Goal\u201d schema is complete; the next step is to validate it against a small set of annotated utterances and refine the intermediate\u2011category taxonomy.\n\nIn short, recordings and transcriptions are progressing steadily, and the SPG schema is in a stable, prototype state with an intermediate\u2011category layer that is ready for initial testing against the corpus.",
    "The Deputy Minister\u2019s amendments were tailored to the three thematic groups in the debate.  \n\n**Group\u202f1 \u2013 Duty to promote public awareness**  \nShe tabled amendments\u202f1 and\u202f4, which create a statutory duty for Welsh Ministers to launch a \u201chigh\u2011intensity\u201d awareness campaign lasting six years from Royal Assent.  The amendments commit the Government to a broad, sustained campaign but deliberately avoid prescribing target audiences, specific content or timelines beyond the six\u2011year horizon.  She rejected the committee\u2011tabled amendments\u202f1A\u20111E as \u201cunnecessary\u201d because the existing duty to respect children\u2019s rights already covers the need for awareness, and she argued that the campaign should be shaped by the expert stakeholder group rather than the Bill itself.  \n\n**Group\u202f2 \u2013 Report on the effect of the legislation**  \nHer amendment\u202f2 introduces a duty to undertake a post\u2011implementation review that will include attitudinal surveys, data collection and an evaluation of the Bill\u2019s impact on services.  She rejected the pre\u2011commencement reporting requirement of amendment\u202f2C, stating it would be redundant, but offered to provide an interim report and to lay a full report before the Assembly after seven years.  She also agreed to incorporate many of the committee\u2019s requested elements into the review and to consult with the committee on the interim report\u2019s contents.  \n\n**Group\u202f3 \u2013 Regulation\u2011making powers**  \nAmendment\u202f3 (and the probing amendment\u202f3A) restores the ministerial power to make regulations\u2014transitory, transitional and saving provisions\u2014to implement section\u202f1.  The Deputy Minister explained that these powers are essential to enable the government to produce the guidance, training and data\u2011collection mechanisms required for the Bill\u2019s effective rollout.  She emphasised that the powers are limited to the core provision and would be reviewed at Stage\u202f3, ensuring that the Assembly retains oversight while the government retains necessary regulatory flexibility.",
    "The committee heard that the Welsh Government\u2019s long\u2011term strategy for raising standards is driven by a cycle of self\u2011evaluation, external review and targeted intervention.  The OECD reviews are used to benchmark progress against the National Mission, while the School Standards and Organisation Act gives local authorities the power to intervene through executive boards, governance changes and financial control.  The National Evaluation and Improvement Resource is being piloted to give schools a structured, data\u2011driven approach to self\u2011assessment, and the government is investing 50\u202f% of its school\u2011standards budget in professional learning for teachers.  The aim is to move more schools out of the red or amber categories, with a multi\u2011agency \u201ctriage\u201d system that brings in Estyn, regional consortia, local authorities and schools to intervene early and sustain improvement.\n\nPhilip Blaker explained that Qualification Wales is the regulator of all awarding bodies in Wales.  Its core responsibilities are to set the approval criteria for qualifications, oversee the design of specifications and sample assessment material, and monitor the awarding of grades to ensure they are fair, comparable and aligned to the curriculum.  Blaker emphasised that the regulator works closely with the WJEC (the sole exam board) to keep the \u201ccomparable outcomes\u201d system robust, to translate resources into Welsh, and to advise on the timing and structure of examinations.  He also highlighted that Qualification Wales will be involved in any future changes to the assessment regime, including the modulation of grades for year\u201111 and year\u201113 students and the handling of modular qualifications such as BTECs.\n\nRegarding the lack of exams, the minister confirmed that the decision to cancel the summer exams was made in consultation with Qualification Wales and the WJEC.  The interim grading scheme will be in place for three years, with year\u201111 and year\u201113 students receiving a grade based on the work already completed and teacher assessment.  AS\u2011level and A2 treatment remains undecided, but the government aims to keep the grading process as close to a normal exam day as possible, using existing externally assessed work and teacher moderation.  The emergency legislation gives ministers flexibility to direct schools, childcare and higher\u2011education institutions to remain open or closed as needed, and to adapt staffing and resource allocation over the short term while a longer\u2011term solution to assessment is developed.",
    "The committee\u2019s evidence session revealed that \u201cgood practice\u201d is still a moving target for Wales.  Ministers and inspectors highlighted that, although the national policy agenda has moved from a narrow focus on exam results to a broader, whole\u2011system self\u2011evaluation model, the reality on the ground remains uneven.  Local authorities differ in how they use their intervention powers, and many schools\u2014especially in secondary education\u2014continue to drift into the red or amber categories because the existing categorisation system and the data used to trigger support are still too blunt.  A key obstacle is the lack of a consistent, early\u2011warning system that can identify struggling schools before they fall into special measures; the current risk\u2011based approach is still largely reactive.  The multi\u2011agency model that combines Estyn, local authorities, consortia and the Welsh Government is still being fine\u2011tuned, and many local authorities have expressed uncertainty about the tools and training needed to step in early.\n\nThese structural challenges spill over into the childcare sector.  The new childcare offer, which is being rolled out in a phased, pilot\u2011led manner, is designed to provide 30\u202fhours of subsidised care plus a 10\u2011hour foundation\u2011phase component.  However, capacity gaps, especially in Welsh\u2011medium provision, remain a concern, as do questions about workforce quality and the potential for a \u201ccheap\u201d model to drive up costs for families.  The debate underscored that, without a robust, data\u2011driven early\u2011warning system for schools, children in the most disadvantaged communities may not receive the consistent, high\u2011quality childcare that the policy promises.  In short, the committee agreed that the challenge of scaling good practice across Wales is intertwined with the need for better coordination, consistent data use, and sufficient capacity\u2014both in schools and in the early\u2011years sector\u2014to ensure that all children, regardless of location or background, benefit from high\u2011quality childcare and education.",
    "**Component availability and design decisions**\n\nThe team confirmed that the core electronics are largely available: the standard TV\u2011remote chip **T_A\u20111835** (used in most remotes) is in stock, and the flexible **PC\u2011B** board can be sized to fit the nine\u2011button layout. The display layer will be a thin **LCD** panel for the flip\u2011top; a full\u2011colour panel was ruled out due to cost and size constraints. Button options include conventional rubber buttons (anti\u2011RSI) and a touch\u2011pad approach using a bare PCB; the final plan is a hybrid\u2014rubberised buttons on the bottom half of the flip and an LCD\u2011based touch area on the top.\n\nPower options were debated. Standard **AA/AAA** cells remain the cheapest baseline, but the team explored **kinetic** (watch\u2011style) and **solar** charging. Kinetic cells are small and can be integrated into a watch\u2011type battery, but their energy density is limited. Solar cells would require a sizeable surface area on the case, increasing cost and fragility. The decision was to keep AA/AAA as the primary option, with a secondary option of kinetic cells for a \u201cgreen\u201d variant, pending cost analysis.\n\nThe **case** will be molded from lightweight plastic to allow a curved, palm\u2011sized shape. A removable **rubberised cover** (spongy, anti\u2011RSI) will provide the \u201cfancy look\u201d identified in market research and allow colour variations (fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable palette). Titanium was considered but rejected due to cost and lack of interchangeable skins.\n\nInterface design settled on a **flip\u2011top**: the top half shows the LCD (with icons for volume, channel, and optional voice\u2011recognition cues), while the bottom half houses the rubber buttons. A brief discussion on a voice\u2011recognition \u201cfind\u2011remote\u201d feature was held, but the team agreed to defer it until a cost\u2011benefit analysis is complete. Overall, the design balances trend\u2011driven aesthetics, functional ergonomics, and component availability.",
    "Professor\u202fB\u2019s main takeaway about the final model is that it is **very close to the best\u2011performing baseline** that had been used before, yet it **does not employ the full \u201cbag of tricks\u201d** that the earlier system used.  He stresses that the new single\u2011piece software, which now contains a wide range of options (spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, mel\u2011band processing, over\u2011subtraction, etc.), is essentially a pragmatic compromise: \u201clet\u2019s pick one approach, lock it down, and not keep tweaking every little parameter.\u201d  The goal is to keep the system stable, avoid unnecessary parameter churn, and preserve the performance gains that the new VAD and noise\u2011estimation improvements have already delivered.  He notes that the model is only about a percent off from the best proposal, and that it still lacks explicit stationary\u2011noise handling, but it is \u201cvery close in performance to the best thing that was there before.\u201d\n\nOn **time\u2011series and reverberation**, the discussion moves to the idea that short 10\u2011ms frames miss most of the reverberation tail.  Professor\u202fB and the students consider using longer windows (on the order of a second or more) to capture the full room impulse response, trading frequency resolution for time resolution.  The plan is to apply a \u201ctime\u2011frequency representation\u201d that keeps the reverberation as a simple convolution, allowing the system to handle variable reverberation without a full echo\u2011cancellation model.  This approach is seen as a practical way to mitigate reverberation effects in the Meeting\u2011Recorder data.\n\nRegarding **pronouncing zero**, the conversation centers on digit\u2011recognition protocols.  Professor\u202fB remarks that the error rates for the Meeting\u2011Recorder digits are higher than for the clean TI\u2011digits, largely because of the recording environment and the way people pronounce \u201czero\u201d (as \u201cO\u201d or \u201czero\u201d).  He highlights that the system\u2019s performance is sensitive to how the digit \u201czero\u201d is recorded and labeled, but he does not propose a new solution\u2014he simply notes that this is an important factor in the overall accuracy.",
    "During the conceptual\u2011design meeting the team agreed on a single, low\u2011cost remote that balances style, usability and new\u2011media features.  \n**Concept & form** \u2013 A double\u2011curved, rubber\u2011covered case was chosen for ergonomics and a \u201csoft\u2011touch\u201d feel. Removable, fruit\u2011or\u2011vegetable\u2011themed covers (e.g., lemon, strawberry) were accepted as a marketing hook. The case will be made of inexpensive plastic with a thin latex layer for grip, keeping the overall weight light.  \n**Energy** \u2013 After debating battery, kinetic and solar options, the group settled on a kinetic (motion\u2011activated) battery as the primary source, with a small rechargeable battery as a backup. This meets sustainability goals and keeps the cost below the \u20ac12.5 target.  \n**Universal remote** \u2013 The remote will support the main consumer devices (TV, VCR/DVD, set\u2011top box) but will not be a full\u2011blown universal remote to avoid cost overruns. An optional LCD display was rejected in favour of an on\u2011screen menu on the TV for simplicity.  \n**Parental control** \u2013 A simple three\u2011digit lock and profile selection were agreed upon. The feature will be optional, activated by a \u201cparent\u201d button that opens a quick login screen.  \n**Games & voice recognition** \u2013 The team decided that games are not a core selling point; a few simple touch\u2011screen games could be added later. Voice recognition will be included as a low\u2011cost add\u2011on, limited to basic commands (e.g., \u201cchannel up\u201d, \u201cvolume down\u201d) to keep the chip and firmware simple.  \n**Buttons & interface** \u2013 Pushbuttons were chosen over a scroll wheel. Essential keys (power, channel, volume, menu, back) plus a numeric pad are planned, with an on\u2011screen menu for advanced settings.  \n\nThese decisions will be prototyped in the next sprint, with a focus on keeping the unit price under \u20ac12.5 while delivering a stylish, user\u2011friendly remote that offers basic universal control, parental lock, and optional voice commands.",
    "The committee\u2019s discussion centred on two key health\u2011policy issues: the possible rise in suicide among children and young people during the pandemic, and the continuity of special care for pregnant women.  \n\nVaughan\u202fGething explained that the Welsh Government has commissioned a review of \u201cunexpected deaths\u201d at the start of COVID\u201119, working with the delivery unit and the national advisory group (including Dr\u202fAnn\u202fJohn).  The aim is to assess whether lockdown restrictions have led to an increase in suicide or other mental\u2011health deaths among young people.  He said a report on the review should be ready before month\u2011end, and that crisis care services remain fully operational for children and young people.  \n\nOn perinatal mental health, Gething highlighted a round\u2011table with the NSPCC that identified good practice and gaps in service provision.  The government is committed to maintaining \u201cconsistent perinatal support for all women across Wales,\u201d including phone and online services where face\u2011to\u2011face contact is limited.  He noted that the number of women seeking mother\u2011and\u2011baby unit care has fallen because of fear of coronavirus, but that the Welsh Government is \u201cstill committed to it\u201d and is working to keep the in\u2011patient provision available, although he could not give a precise timetable for when this will be fully restored.  The minister stressed that the progress made in perinatal care must not be lost and that the government is monitoring usage and adjusting resources to ensure continued support for new mothers during and after the pandemic.",
    "The Minister said the work on the new curriculum and the wider national mission will be completed on the timetable that was set out at the start of the Assembly term \u2013 the implementation is slated to finish by the end of the current academic year, with the first full roll\u2011out in the following year.  She stressed that the risk of \u201closing focus\u201d is real, but that a phased, monitored approach will keep the project on track.  The government recognises that the more ambitious improvements \u2013 for example, the new self\u2011evaluation toolkit, the multi\u2011agency intervention model and the updated categorisation system \u2013 are more complex and could divert attention, so the Minister has committed to continuous oversight and to keeping the national mission\u2019s milestones intact.\n\nWhen asked about the difficulty of making these improvements, the Minister highlighted that the biggest challenge is ensuring that the system remains coherent and that resources are matched to the new expectations.  She noted that the risk of losing focus is mitigated by keeping the national mission on a fixed timetable and by regular reporting from the OECD and Estyn.\n\nIn the latter part of the session the Minister spoke about the networking within the PRU (Pupil Referral Unit) and the transition arrangements.  She explained that PRUs are now working more closely with local authorities and schools, using part\u2011time timetables and a managed\u2011reduction model to help pupils move back into mainstream education or into further education.  The discussion emphasised the importance of multi\u2011agency collaboration, coordinated support and a clear transition pathway to ensure that pupils do not fall through the cracks.",
    "The team agreed that the remote\u2019s core transmission method should be infrared (IR).  They considered IR the most practical option because it does not require a line\u2011of\u2011sight, is inexpensive to implement, and can be made reliable with a solid\u2011state IR emitter and receiver.  The discussion highlighted the need for a \u201cclear, reliable IR signal\u201d so that users would not have to move the remote around or aim it precisely.  They also noted that the IR subsystem must be designed to work with a long\u2011lasting battery, as frequent battery changes were a major user frustration.  In short, the group viewed IR as the default, cost\u2011effective, and user\u2011friendly choice for the remote\u2019s communication channel.\n\nOn disposable income, the marketing and design members focused on the 15\u201135\u2011year\u2011old cohort as the primary target.  They argued that this age bracket typically has \u201ca fair amount of disposable income\u201d \u2013 not tied up in mortgages, cars, or long\u2011term commitments \u2013 and is willing to spend on a stylish, functional remote.  The remote\u2019s projected price of around \u20ac25 (or \u20ac12\u2013\u20ac12.50 for production) was deemed affordable for this group, especially given the perceived value of a modern, IR\u2011based device.  The team noted that older age groups were less likely to pay for voice\u2011recognition or advanced features, reinforcing the decision to keep the remote simple and price\u2011competitive for the chosen demographic.  Overall, the group saw IR as the optimal technical solution and believed the target market\u2019s disposable income would support a mid\u2011priced, feature\u2011rich remote.",
    "The committee\u2019s view is that free\u2011school\u2011meal (FSM) eligibility remains the most practical, if imperfect, proxy for children who are likely to need additional support.  Members acknowledged that the measure can \u201cblur\u201d \u2013 some pupils who need help fall outside the FSM band and some who are entitled to FSM may not be in the most disadvantaged situations \u2013 but they agreed that, in the absence of a better national indicator, FSM is the best available marker for targeting the Pupil Development Grant (PDG).  The Cabinet Secretary repeatedly stressed that any future refinements (e.g., longer\u2011term projections or a broader definition) would be considered, but that FSM will remain the core eligibility criterion for the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement, the group cited a range of evidence.  Schools that have used PDG to deliver universal interventions such as growth\u2011mindset training or attachment\u2011disorder support have seen a disproportionate improvement in FSM pupils\u2019 attendance and engagement.  Specific examples included Ysgol\u202fy\u202fPreseli\u2019s \u201cwalking bus\u201d and early\u2011morning support, and secondary schools employing nurses and counsellors to link pupils with wider agencies.  Estyn reports and the committee\u2019s own inquiries show that attendance for FSM pupils has risen, yet a gap persists \u2013 35\u202f% of FSM pupils at level\u202f4 achieve 95\u202f% attendance versus 60\u202f% of non\u2011FSM pupils.  The committee therefore views PDG as a useful tool that can enhance attendance and engagement, but it remains an ongoing challenge, especially for older pupils, and requires continued monitoring, evidence\u2011based interventions, and a multi\u2011agency approach.",
    "The professor\u2019s comments on support\u2011vector machines (SVMs) were largely positive but framed in the context of the broader landscape of classification methods used in speech recognition. He highlighted that SVMs are \u201csuccinct\u201d and rely on a small set of *support vectors* \u2013 the critical examples that lie nearest the decision boundary \u2013 rather than a dense set of parameters as in neural nets or Gaussian mixtures. This gives SVMs an advantage when training data is modest: the model is effectively a condensed nearest\u2011neighbour system, which can reduce over\u2011fitting and computational load. The professor also noted that earlier work from Mississippi State had used SVMs to estimate probabilities (via a sigmoidal or soft\u2011max mapping of the distance to the hyperplane) and that the results were \u201cOK\u201d but not groundbreaking, suggesting that while SVMs are a useful tool, they had not yet eclipsed more established techniques.\n\nRegarding speech\u2011rate algorithms, the transcript does not contain any direct discussion by the professor. No mention is made of methods for estimating or compensating for speaking rate, nor of how such algorithms might integrate with the recognition pipeline. Consequently, the professor\u2019s thoughts on speech\u2011rate algorithms are not documented in the provided meetings.",
    "Professor\u202fE\u2019s view on echoes, reverberation, and acoustic events is that they are fundamental, yet often overlooked, sources of error that require explicit handling beyond the usual feature\u2011level tricks.  He is clear that echoes\u2014especially those introduced by re\u2011synthesised signals\u2014can \u201cecho the speech in the background\u201d and distort alignment, so they should be identified and removed early, for example by a VAD that drops low\u2011energy speech frames or by mean\u2011subtraction techniques that suppress the low\u2011energy tail where reverberation is most audible.  Regarding reverberation, he notes that the room\u2019s reverberation time (about 0.7\u20130.8\u202fs in the meeting room) can bleed into the signal, and that high\u2011pass filtering or careful mean\u2011subtraction can mitigate its effect, but only if the processing is applied consistently to both training and test data.  He also stresses that reverberation is not simply a nuisance; it changes the dynamic range and the scale of the acoustic model outputs, which in turn affects insertion penalties and language scaling.  \n\nOn acoustic events, Professor\u202fE draws a sharp line between *features* (the engineered descriptors that linguists talk about) and *events* (measurable, often abrupt changes in the raw signal).  He argues that acoustic events should be robust, data\u2011driven detectors that can be fed into a recogniser as a complementary source of information.  He proposes a bottom\u2011up approach: detect events such as voicing, onsets, or spectral shape changes, and then feed these into a probabilistic AND\u2011OR model or a neural network, rather than relying solely on top\u2011down phone\u2011level features.  In short, echoes and reverberation must be explicitly modelled and mitigated, while acoustic events should be treated as independent, measurable phenomena that can enhance recognition when combined with conventional features.",
    "The team converged on a **minimal\u2011push\u2011button user interface** that prioritises ease of use and tactile feedback over high\u2011tech gimmicks.  After reviewing a variety of concepts\u2014iPod\u2011style scroll wheels, a \u201cclassic telephone\u201d layout, a full LCD menu, and even voice\u2011recognition\u2014they decided that the simplest solution would best meet the target market (15\u201135 year olds) and keep costs below the \u20ac25 price point.\n\nKey decisions:\n\n1. **Button layout** \u2013 a small set of large, clearly labelled buttons: power, volume up/down, channel up/down, a numeric keypad (0\u20119), and a central \u201center/menu\u201d button.  Optional side scroll\u2011wheel or arrow buttons were considered but ultimately the group chose a straightforward four\u2011directional pad with a central button to keep the interface intuitive.\n\n2. **No LCD or advanced display** \u2013 the remote will rely on the TV screen for feedback, eliminating the cost of a built\u2011in display.\n\n3. **Material and feel** \u2013 a plastic shell with an optional soft rubber cover (spongy feel) was chosen to provide a comfortable grip while staying inexpensive.  Titanium and wood were rejected for cost and manufacturability.\n\n4. **Power source** \u2013 kinetic energy was preferred over batteries or solar, offering a convenient, maintenance\u2011free option that aligns with the \u201ceasy\u2011to\u2011use\u201d ethos.\n\n5. **Feature set** \u2013 the remote will support basic TV functions only (volume, channel, numeric entry).  Teletext, D\u2011V\u2011D, and voice\u2011recognition were dropped to keep the design simple and the price low.\n\nIn short, the team settled on a compact, ergonomic remote with a small set of large push buttons, optional soft cover, kinetic power, and no LCD or voice features, ensuring a user\u2011friendly experience that fits the company\u2019s budget and target audience.",
    "During the product\u2011evaluation phase the project manager consistently framed the design choices around **budget, functionality and market appeal**.  \n\n**Plastic material** \u2013 He saw plastic as the only viable base material that would keep the unit under the \u20ac12.50 target.  He acknowledged that plastic would sacrifice the \u201cspongy\u201d feel of rubber, but noted that a rubber grip could be added to the plastic core to give a more ergonomic, bio\u2011morphic touch.  The manager was willing to keep the plastic shell but was open to \u201crubber over\u2011wrap\u201d or a rubber extension to give a \u201ctail\u201d that would rest on the wrist.  \n\n**Changeable cover** \u2013 The PM welcomed the idea of removable, interchangeable covers as a way to add a fashion element without inflating the core cost.  He saw this as a selling point for younger, trend\u2011seeking customers, while keeping a standard white or black cover for the base model.  He cautioned that a full\u2011time changeable cover line would increase logistics, but he considered it acceptable if it stayed within the budget.  \n\n**Color** \u2013 The default color was black (or metallic grey), but the manager was open to offering \u201cfruit\u2011and\u2011veg\u201d bright colours (yellow, orange, blue) as optional extras.  He believed that a bright, eye\u2011catching colour would help the remote stand out in a living\u2011room clutter, but he wanted to keep the base model simple and inexpensive.  \n\n**Shape** \u2013 The discussion on curvature was a key cost lever.  A double\u2011curved, fully ergonomic shape would raise the price by roughly one euro, so the manager leaned toward a **single\u2011curved** profile that still offered a pleasing silhouette while staying under budget.  He also noted that the shape should accommodate the LCD placement and joystick ergonomics, but not at the expense of cost or complexity.  \n\nIn sum, the project manager viewed plastic as the core material, optional rubber grip, a single\u2011curved shape, standard black/white colors with optional bright covers, all balanced to keep the product affordable and market\u2011ready.",
    "The group focused on two intertwined goals: (1) **fixing the current system** so that it can be submitted for the upcoming evaluation, and (2) **boosting the baseline performance** to meet the 50\u202f% improvement target.  \n\n**Fixing the system**  \n- The main bottleneck identified was the **delay introduced by the silence\u2011detection module**.  The team agreed that the server\u2011side detector was too slow, so they decided to **remove it for the baseline run** and rely on the handset\u2011side detector, accepting the slight loss in robustness.  \n- A **weighting scheme (40\u202f% well\u2011matched, 30\u202f% medium\u2011mismatch, 30\u202f% highly\u2011mismatch)** was proposed to combine the three conditions into a single score.  This scheme was chosen because it reflects the relative importance of each condition without requiring additional training.  \n- The **combo architecture** (low\u2011pass filtered features + unfiltered features, each fed to an MLP and summed) was retained for the best\u2011performing yellow\u2011marked systems, but the low\u2011pass path was removed from the baseline to reduce latency.  \n- The **KLT (Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve transform)** was kept for the yellow systems but omitted from the baseline because of the extra processing time it adds.  \n\n**Improvements on the baseline**  \n- The baseline **OGI\u20112** (OGI features only) was used as a reference; the current best system improves it by roughly **22\u202f%** on average.  \n- The **Italian mismatched condition** was the most sensitive; the combo + KLT system improved it by 6\u202f% relative to the baseline.  \n- Adding a **second silence detector** (on the server side) was considered but rejected for the baseline due to delay.  \n- The team also discussed **feature\u2011level compression** (e.g., liftering, power\u2011law scaling) and **variance weighting** of cepstral coefficients as potential future experiments to further tighten the baseline.  \n\nIn summary, the plan is to submit the **baseline without the low\u2011pass filter and KLT**, apply the **40/30/30 weighting** across conditions, and report the 22\u202f% improvement while noting that the more advanced combo system already yields significant gains on the mismatched Italian data.",
    "The committee\u2019s debate highlighted a range of policy responses to the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout. On **legislation**, members debated the need for obesity targets and related regulatory measures, noting that any new targets would require careful consultation and evidence\u2011based metrics. The discussion also touched on the planning system\u2019s role in restricting fast\u2011food take\u2011aways and the need for local leadership in public health policy. In the **energy sector**, the committee examined the government\u2019s support for oil and gas through liquidity measures, a $500\u202fmillion loan facility, and a dedicated pipeline project (Coastal\u202fGasLink). Critics questioned the alignment of this funding with the announced green\u2011economy transition, while others argued it was essential for jobs and energy security. The **tourism** sector was a major concern: the ferry service between Maine and Nova Scotia was cited as an example of the need for targeted support, and the committee called for investment in tourism infrastructure to revive the industry.\n\nThe **sports infrastructure** debate focused on new schools lacking changing rooms and toilets, arguing that school facilities should be designed for community use to promote physical activity. The **green\u2011economy funding** was scrutinised, with some members pointing out the allocation of large sums to fossil\u2011fuel projects as contradictory to climate commitments.  \n\nFinally, the committee highlighted the **Covid\u201119 impact** on key industries: fishing faced a 95\u202f% drop in Asian markets, tourism revenue collapsed, and oil and gas saw a sharp decline in demand. Small businesses reported 50\u2013100\u202f% revenue losses, prompting calls for rent\u2011assistance, PPE supplies, and broader financial support. Overall, the discussion underscored the need for coordinated, evidence\u2011based policy, cross\u2011sector collaboration, and transparent funding to mitigate the pandemic\u2019s economic damage.",
    "During the design workshop the team settled on a **minimal\u2011function remote**.  Only the essential TV controls \u2013 channel up/down, power, volume, mute and a single \u201cmenu\u201d button \u2013 were kept.  Extra functions such as V\u2011CR, DVD or teletext were dropped to avoid clutter and keep the price under \u20ac25.  \n\nThe original rectangular shape was rejected.  After several sketches the group agreed on a **single\u2011curved, ergonomic silhouette** that fits comfortably in the hand.  A double\u2011curved version was considered but ruled out because it would force rubber buttons and preclude a scroll\u2011wheel.  \n\nPersonalisation was brought up as a selling point.  The idea of interchangeable **fruit\u2011shaped casings** (banana, broccoli, strawberry) was embraced, but the feasibility discussion highlighted the need for a durable, spongy material that could be replaced easily.  Rubber or latex with a coloured finish was chosen as the most practical option, and the team confirmed that the casing could be swapped without affecting the internal electronics.  \n\nA novel shape \u2013 a \u201cbanana\u2011like\u201d or \u201cbroccoli\u2011like\u201d form \u2013 was explored.  The consensus was that while a fully organic shape would be eye\u2011catching, it would compromise ergonomics.  Instead, the final casing will be a **single\u2011curved body in a spongy rubber material** with the option to mount interchangeable fruit\u2011themed skins.  This design satisfies the desire for trendiness, functionality, and manufacturability within the set budget.",
    "The marketing team\u2019s suggestion to use bright, \u201cfruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable\u201d hues\u2014particularly lemon or lime\u2014was driven by two interlocking motives: **product differentiation** and **alignment with a current design trend**.\n\nFirst, the team recognised that the market for remote controls is saturated with dark, utilitarian units that are easy to lose. A lemon\u2011 or lime\u2011shaded body immediately stands out on a couch or in a dark room, making the remote visible and \u201cfriendly.\u201d The bright colour also ties in with the corporate palette (yellow) and the idea of a \u201cglowing\u201d or back\u2011lit interface, reinforcing the product\u2019s high\u2011tech, user\u2011friendly image.\n\nSecond, the proposal was grounded in a broader European design trend that the marketing research had highlighted: a move toward **vibrant natural colours** and **fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable aesthetics** in furniture, clothing, and interior d\u00e9cor. This trend emphasises soft, spongy textures and lively hues that feel fresh and contemporary. By adopting lemon or lime, the remote would echo this trend, positioning the product as modern, stylish, and in sync with consumer expectations for \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cpersonalised\u201d home\u2011tech accessories.\n\nIn short, the colour choice was intended to make the remote instantly recognizable and pleasant to hold, while simultaneously signalling that the brand is attuned to the latest aesthetic currents in home d\u00e9cor and consumer electronics.",
    "The simulation\u2011market evaluation concludes that the proposed remote\u2011control style \u2013 a single, flip\u2011open handset that uses infrared signalling, a small touch\u2011screen for programming, and a soft\u2011rubberised, banana\u2011shaped shell \u2013 satisfies the new project requirements and the key market\u2011research findings.  Market data showed that users dislike the bulk of current remotes, prefer a \u201cfancy\u201d look, are willing to pay more for improved aesthetics, and use only 10\u202f% of the buttons.  The design cuts unnecessary functions (teletext, date\u2011setting, full\u2011size programming) and replaces them with a simple LCD prompt, thereby aligning with the \u201cTV\u2011only\u201d mandate.  Battery choice was revisited; the team decided to use a single rechargeable cell (or a low\u2011cost AA pack) to keep cost in line while avoiding frequent replacements.\n\nAdjustments made to the prototype \u2013 a curved, lightweight body, a touch\u2011screen for advanced functions, optional voice\u2011recognition, and a beeping locator \u2013 directly respond to the R.S.I. concerns.  The curved shell reduces thumb strain, the rubberised coating offers a softer grip, and the touch\u2011screen eliminates the need for many small buttons, all of which scored well in the internal rating exercise.  The only area that scored lower was the \u201cminimise R.S.I.\u201d criterion, but the design still achieved an acceptable rating (\u22482.5\u202f/\u202f5), which the team judged adequate given current technology and budget constraints.\n\nOverall, the remote meets the core criteria: it is stylish, user\u2011friendly, technologically innovative, and cost\u2011effective, and it incorporates the new project requirements.  The R.S.I. minimisation is acceptable, though further refinement could be explored in future iterations.  The team therefore agrees to proceed to prototype production and market launch.",
    "The committee\u2019s deliberations painted a picture of an uncertain future for Canada\u2019s key institutions.  Members noted that the pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses in health, justice, and social\u2011services institutions, and called for stronger oversight and funding\u2014especially for the Auditor General\u2019s office and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.  In the arena of women\u2019s issues, the discussion was dominated by the persistent inequities that women face in the workplace, education, and the justice system.  The minister of diversity and inclusion was urged to deliver concrete, legally binding commitments to end over\u2011policing, over\u2011incarceration, and systemic discrimination, while the opposition highlighted the need for gender\u2011based data and stronger support for Black and Indigenous women.  On housing, the committee reviewed the Canada Housing Benefit and the Affordable Housing Plan, with members demanding a clearer timeline, increased federal support, and a commitment to eliminate long\u2011term boil\u2011water advisories and to fund new housing projects.  Throughout the session, MPs from across the country\u2014ranging from rural constituencies to urban centres\u2014voiced frustrations over the pace of relief, the lack of disaggregated data, and the need for more responsive policy.  The debate underscored a common theme: that institutions must be more accountable, inclusive, and better funded if they are to meet Canada\u2019s social and economic challenges.",
    "The group discussed how the newly\u2011recorded \u201cmeeting digits\u201d differ from the standard TI\u2011digits and what this means for training and recognition.  The recordings were taken in a real meeting room with a near\u2011microphone, producing a much noisier, more reverberant signal than the studio\u2011recorded TI\u2011digits.  Because of this, the best error rate on the meeting digits was about 3\u20134\u202f% with a simple HTK system, whereas TI\u2011digits achieve roughly 0.8\u202f% under the same tandem\u2011system setup.  The team noted that the meeting data are more representative of real telephone speech, so the higher error is expected.  They also discussed that the meeting recordings are limited in size (only a few minutes per meeting) and that more varied speakers and conditions are needed for robust training.  \n\nTo improve accuracy, the group is working on a new pre\u2011segmentation module that uses channel\u2011specific speech\u2011vs\u2011non\u2011speech detection, and on a better VAD that can be applied before LDA to reduce delay.  Transcribers will be tasked with marking digit boundaries and channel information; the recordings will be converted to a multi\u2011channel format with time stamps for forced alignment.  Once the data are properly annotated, the team plans to run forced alignment, generate recognizer training sets, and evaluate with the SRI recognizer.  The discussion also touched on the need for a more robust feature set (e.g., modulation spectra) and the possibility of using factorial HMMs for future work.  Overall, the meeting emphasized that while the meeting digits are harder to recognize, they provide a realistic testbed for improving digit recognition in noisy, multi\u2011speaker environments.",

    "The committee\u2019s evidence session revealed that the work of the four regional consortia has been a mixed blessing.  Jassa\u202fScott praised the consortia\u2019s progress in \u201cembedding knowledge of school strengths and weaknesses\u201d and in \u201csupporting and challenging schools, especially those causing concern,\u201d but warned that the shift to a more data\u2011driven, multi\u2011agency model had not yet fully addressed the lag in early identification of schools in need.  She also highlighted the risk of local authorities \u201csafeguarding school funding at the expense of well\u2011being, attendance and behaviour services,\u201d a shortfall that the consortia are now being asked to help remedy.  The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty\u202fWilliams, stressed that the consortia are an arm\u2011length vehicle through which the Welsh Government can \u201cdeploy a national approach to school improvement\u201d while still respecting local accountability; she underlined that the Secretary\u2019s role is to coordinate, monitor and, when necessary, intervene to keep the consortia on track.  The Auditor General\u2019s office, meanwhile, has seen its budget doubled in 2018\u201119, but Jassa\u202fScott noted that the Auditor General still faces \u201chalf as many audits as before\u201d because of the scale of government spending, and the committee has asked for more resources to ensure robust oversight.  Bill\u202fBlair\u2019s brief response to the firearms seizure at Pearson Airport acknowledged the seriousness of the 1,500\u2011firearm haul and outlined a package of measures aimed at social stability: tighter gun\u2011control legislation, community\u2011based outreach, and a renewed focus on public safety.  Politically, the group sits at the heart of the Welsh Government\u2019s education reform agenda, whose aim is to raise standards, improve teacher quality and close attainment gaps through a coordinated, evidence\u2011based system of regional support and national oversight.",
    "The team\u2019s discussion centered on making the remote both **functional and user\u2011friendly** while adding several new features.  \n**Lost\u2011and\u2011found realization**: After noting that users often misplace the remote, the group agreed on a \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d feature. Options explored were a built\u2011in beep, a flashing LED, a light\u2011sensor that triggers a sound or light when the remote is in a dark spot, and a voice\u2011activated \u201cfind\u201d command that could also be triggered by a clap. The consensus was to combine a small LED and a \u201cfind\u201d button that, when pressed, emits a distinctive beep or flash, making the remote easy to locate without a separate tracking device.  \n\n**Improvements from the project evaluation**: The team decided to **reduce button clutter**\u2014keeping only essential controls (power, volume, channel, mute, numbers) and using raised, soft\u2011rubber buttons with universal symbols. A **smart chip** would allow the remote to switch between TV, DVD, and home\u2011automation devices, and a **larger, ergonomic shape** (kidney\u2011shaped, biomorphic) was chosen to improve grip for all ages. A **battery indicator** and a **stand\u2011in base** were added for charging and stability. The design also incorporated a **menu button** for accessing audio/video settings and subtitles, and a **voice\u2011recognition module** was earmarked as a future selling point.  \n\n**New functions brainstormed**: Beyond basic TV control, the team discussed adding **temperature control** for air\u2011conditioners, a **home\u2011automation hub** to manage lights and heating, and a **clap\u2011activated \u201cfind\u201d** feature. Other ideas included a **smart\u2011chip\u2011based multi\u2011device selector**, a **subtitles toggle**, and a **color\u2011changing LED** to signal the remote\u2019s status. The group also considered a **track\u2011and\u2011find** module that could be paired with a phone app, although cost concerns limited its immediate inclusion.  \n\nOverall, the remote is shaping up as a sleek, multi\u2011functional controller with a clear lost\u2011and\u2011found feature, reduced button set, and optional voice\u2011control, all aimed at improving usability and market appeal.",
    "During the finance portion of the meeting the team revisited the **special\u2011color strategy** for the button set.  The consensus was that the remote should feature **at least two, ideally three, distinct colors** to keep the product visible, brand\u2011recognizable and \u201cfun\u201d for users.  The discussion settled on a **corporate yellow\u2011and\u2011black scheme** for the primary version, with a **secondary, more subdued line** (black\u2011white or grey\u2011black) for a \u201ctamer\u201d market segment.  The case itself would remain a single color, but each button could carry one of the chosen special hues.  The designers noted that using a limited palette would help control costs while still delivering a \u201cfancy\u201d look that could be marketed as a \u201cfruit\u2011inspired\u201d remote.\n\nMarketing, however, expressed clear **dissatisfaction** with the final changes to the button colors.  The finance team had trimmed the palette, eliminating the **original fruity palette** that had been part of the initial design brief.  Marketing argued that the removal of those bright, distinctive colors would make the remote **harder to spot**, less \u201cfashionable,\u201d and would undermine the product\u2019s differentiation in a crowded market.  They felt the new, more generic color scheme would dilute the brand\u2019s visual identity and reduce the remote\u2019s appeal to consumers who value a playful, eye\u2011catching design.  In short, Marketing was unhappy because the cost\u2011cutting decisions removed the special colors that were intended to make the remote both visible and stylish.",
    "**Implementation of the Welsh dimension**  \n- The government recognises that a *single, cross\u2011curriculum Welsh dimension* requires a wide range of resources \u2013 from curriculum guides to specialist content such as Welsh contributions to computing and the arts.  \n- The Welsh language continuum is being built into the curriculum, with clear progression points for both Welsh\u2011medium and English\u2011medium schools, but the approach must be contextualised to each setting.  \n- A dedicated programme is already in place to produce the resources needed, and the Welsh Government is working with Qualifications Wales to ensure that the qualification and its resources are aligned and available to all schools.  \n\n**Employers\u2019 understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate**  \n- Across the board, employers largely **do not understand what the Welsh Bac is** or how it benefits them. The qualification is seen as bureaucratic, time\u2011consuming and not aligned with industry needs.  \n- Employers report that the Bac is often \u201crepeated\u201d from school to college, adding pressure on learners and diminishing its perceived value.  \n- The consensus is that the Bac should be **reviewed with strong employer involvement** to re\u2011focus it on employability and entrepreneurial skills, and to clarify its role for universities and the workforce.  \n\n**Benefits of an independent inspectorate (Estyn)**  \n- Estyn\u2019s independence gives it the **authority to hold schools, colleges and other education providers to account** without political influence.  \n- The body uses a *self\u2011evaluation and peer/nominee inspector* model that encourages schools to become learning organisations and to own their improvement.  \n- Estyn\u2019s reports and public assurance provide transparency and confidence for parents, employers and the public, while its partnership with other inspectorates (Ofsted, Education Scotland, etc.) allows cross\u2011learning and a shared focus on quality.  \n\nIn short, the Welsh dimension needs robust resources and contextualisation; the Welsh Bac requires a clearer, employer\u2011driven review; and an independent inspectorate such as Estyn is essential for impartial accountability and continuous improvement across Wales.",
    "The team\u2019s view on the convenience of presentation materials was mixed, leaning toward a preference for simple, tactile tools over complex software.  They noted that the whiteboard and pens were generally convenient: the board was used for quick, visual brainstorming, and pens allowed for immediate note\u2011taking.  However, the whiteboard\u2019s marker \u201cstopped working\u201d during the session, highlighting a minor reliability issue.  \n\nIn contrast, the group expressed clear frustration with digital presentation tools.  PowerPoint and other Microsoft\u2011based software were described as \u201cnot convenient\u201d and \u201cstupid,\u201d with one participant stating a strong dislike for the \u201cPowerPoint presentations.\u201d  Another mentioned a preference for Unix or WordPerfect, indicating a lack of comfort with the mainstream Windows ecosystem.  The difficulty in accessing the required software\u2014needing to find an old disk or reinstall programs\u2014was cited as a barrier to smooth presentation.  The use of microphones was also seen as clumsy, especially when moving to the whiteboard, further detracting from the overall convenience of the presentation setup.  \n\nOverall, while the physical materials (pens, whiteboard) were deemed useful, the reliance on and dependence on digital tools (PowerPoint, Microsoft software, microphones) were seen as inconvenient and a source of friction.  The team suggested a shift toward more straightforward, paper\u2011based or low\u2011tech methods for future meetings.",
    "The team rejected an LCD display for the remote for several practical and design\u2011centric reasons that emerged during the discussion of interface controls and scroll\u2011wheel options. First, an LCD would require an **advanced logic chip** and a dedicated power supply, driving up both cost and complexity. The group was already leaning toward a low\u2011tech solution with push\u2011buttons and a simple or regular chip to keep manufacturing price down and the device lightweight. Second, the **screen size would be too small** to be useful on a handheld remote; the team noted that it would be difficult to read in the dark and that a tiny display would add little value compared with the basic channel, volume, and power functions that users need most. Third, the LCD would demand **back\u2011lighting and additional battery life**, conflicting with the kinetic\u2011battery concept and the goal of a long\u2011lasting, low\u2011maintenance remote. Fourth, the design team saw that an LCD would **complicate the user interface** by adding an extra layer of interaction that could distract from the straightforward push\u2011button layout and the proposed scroll wheel for channel surfing. Finally, the discussion highlighted that the LCD would not support the \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d the market research indicated was most important, whereas a tactile, rubber\u2011covered, curved case with simple buttons better met that aesthetic. In short, the LCD was deemed an unnecessary technological add\u2011on that would raise cost, weight, and power consumption without delivering a clear functional advantage, so the team chose to keep the interface simple and focus on push buttons, a scroll wheel, and a kinetic battery.",
    "**Self\u2011Introduction**  \nThe team opened with brief introductions: Heather, the project manager, led the discussion; the industrial designer, the marketing executive, and Craig from user interface (UI) followed. Each noted their role\u2014Heather on project planning, the designer on form, marketing on positioning, and UI on interaction.\n\n**Project Introduction**  \nThe group set out to design a \u201cbanana\u2011shaped\u201d TV remote that would sell for \u20ac25 and cost no more than \u20ac12.50. Key design ideas were a banana\u2011leaf aesthetic, a detachable base station with solar\u2011cell charging, two scroll wheels (volume/channel), a turbo button that toggles TV power, and a minimal LCD for basic status. No LCD\u2011display, speech recognition, or advanced chips were allowed to keep costs down.\n\n**Brainstorming Process**  \nIdeas flowed freely in a mix of verbal debate and whiteboard sketches. The team discussed button functions, the turbo button\u2019s dual use, the teletext navigation, LED backlighting, antenna integration, and color schemes. Cost\u2011saving options\u2014removing solar cells, simplifying the LCD, and using a single\u2011curved body\u2014were weighed against user experience. The team also noted the need for a focus group and external validation but lacked time to conduct one.\n\n**Project Evaluation**  \nUsing a 1\u20137 scale, the group evaluated the remote on \u201cfancy,\u201d \u201cfunctional,\u201d \u201ccost,\u201d \u201cusability,\u201d and \u201cbrand recognition.\u201d Scores ranged from 3 to 6, with the overall average around 5.5. The evaluation highlighted that while the design was trendy, it fell short on functionality and cost targets. The team also discussed the limitations of the current prototype and the potential need for a second\u2011generation model.\n\n**Project Process**  \nThe process followed a typical design cycle: briefing, concept generation, functional design, detailed design, and evaluation. Meetings were structured with role\u2011specific agendas, whiteboard and digital\u2011pen notes, and PowerPoint summaries. The team identified gaps in collaboration tools, noted that remote work limited spontaneous idea exchange, and planned to refine the prototype, re\u2011evaluate costs, and prepare for a market\u2011ready version. The next steps involved finalizing the design, creating a cost sheet, and scheduling a focus\u2011group test to validate the banana concept.",
    "During the \u201cextra designs or gadgets\u201d segment the team debated whether to embed rechargeable units in the remote. The idea surfaced repeatedly as a potential differentiator: it would eliminate the need to replace batteries, reduce waste, and appeal to users who value convenience. The industrial designer noted that rechargeable Pen\u2011lite batteries were already available and could be wired into a small charging dock or even a built\u2011in charger that plugs into the TV\u2019s power outlet. The project manager highlighted that this feature would be a selling point for the target younger\u2011than\u2011forty segment, who are willing to pay a little extra for added comfort. Marketing agreed that consumers were open to paying for \u201ccomfort\u201d and that a recharge\u2011capable remote could boost perceived value, especially if it could be docked on a coffee\u2011table or TV stand.\n\nHowever, several concerns emerged. The team questioned the cost implications: a docking station, charging circuitry, and extra space for batteries could raise the bill of materials and potentially push the retail price above the \u20ac25 target. The industrial designer warned that adding a charging circuit would increase component count and complexity, possibly affecting reliability and design compactness. User\u2011interface representatives raised practical issues\u2014users might forget to recharge or want to switch to standard batteries if the remote runs out mid\u2011night. They also noted that the added weight and size could detract from the sleek, minimal aesthetic the group was aiming for.\n\nIn short, the consensus was that a rechargeable unit was a compelling concept that could differentiate the product and appeal to cost\u2011conscious consumers, but it required careful cost\u2011benefit analysis, space planning, and a clear charging mechanism to avoid compromising the remote\u2019s lightweight, simple design.",
    "During the meeting the group reached a clear consensus on how to handle the microphone setup for future recordings.  The main decision was to **standardise the microphones as much as possible**.  The lapel mics that had been used were noted to be of poor quality and to introduce a lot of variability from speaker to speaker.  The group agreed that the best way to reduce this non\u2011uniformity was to switch to a single type of close\u2011talking, head\u2011mounted mic and to use it consistently across all participants.  The discussion also included the practicalities of the new mic: it should be worn a thumb\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half away from the mouth and at the corner of the speaker\u2019s mouth to minimise breath noise.  \n\nTo test the new hardware the team decided to order a **small batch of identical head\u2011mounted wireless mics** (the \u201cCrown\u201d model) and to have a few people try them in the room before committing to a larger purchase.  The group also considered adding a single hand\u2011held wireless mic that could be passed around for people who need to speak after the meeting has started, but this was deferred until the standard mics had been evaluated.  \n\nFinally, the team agreed that each mic channel would be recorded separately and then time\u2011aligned to the main meeting audio.  This would allow them to keep the audio quality high while still having the convenience of a single\u2011channel mix for transcription and speech\u2011recognition pipelines.  In short, the decision was to move away from the current heterogeneous lapel set, adopt a single, standardized head\u2011mounted mic, test a small sample of units, and record all channels separately for later alignment.",
    "**Meilyr\u202fRowlands**  \nDuring the committee\u2019s discussion, Rowlands highlighted that secondary schools face a \u201cgreater challenge\u201d than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum, largely because they are operating on tighter budgets and have fewer surplus funds. He warned that the \u201cdeficit\u201d in secondary schools can limit the time and resources available for professional development, staff recruitment and for the implementation of new teaching and learning strategies. Rowlands also noted that secondary schools are often less able to provide the same level of emotional and mental\u2011health support that primary schools can, because pupils at this stage are more discerning and the staff who interact with them are fewer and often spread across larger schools. He stressed that a \u201ccommunity\u2011school\u201d approach \u2013 where schools, local authorities and families work together \u2013 is essential to support pupils\u2019 well\u2011being and to ensure that the mental\u2011health needs of older students are met.  \n\n**Kirsty\u202fWilliams\u202fAM**  \nWilliams explained that the Welsh Government\u2019s reopening strategy is based on a set of principles that prioritise the safety and \u201cphysical and emotional well\u2011being\u201d of children, staff and the wider community. She outlined practical measures \u2013 such as social distancing, transport arrangements, adequate staffing levels and the use of testing \u2013 that will be required before any further phase of reopening. On emotional and mental\u2011health support, Williams said that schools are being encouraged to keep close contact with vulnerable children, to maintain safeguarding and counselling services (including remote or telephone support where necessary) and to ensure that pupils who need additional help are identified and referred promptly. Regarding studying from home, she praised the \u201cStay Learning\u201d policy and the Hwb digital platform, which provide guidance and resources for parents and carers to support home learning. Williams urged schools and families to use the Hwb platform to set realistic learning expectations, and to keep lines of communication open so that children can continue to receive the support they need while learning remotely.",
    "During the detailed\u2011design session the Industrial Designer (Sebastian) focused on how the spherical form could reconcile practicality, cost, and user experience. He first raised the technical feasibility of a ball\u2011shaped remote, noting that while a sphere offers excellent stability, it would roll unless a flat base or weighted centre were added. He suggested a flat, slightly concave bottom or a subtle ridge to keep the device from tumbling, and considered adding textured grips along the sides to improve handling without compromising the sleek look.\n\nSebastian stressed that the remote must be robust enough for everyday use\u2014including being tossed or dropped\u2014yet still fit within the \u20ac12.50 production budget. He argued for a minimal button layout, emphasizing large, tactile keys that can be pressed by sightless users, and proposed a backlit or glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark scheme to aid operation in low light. He also mentioned the possibility of a small internal display to show active functions, though he acknowledged this could add cost and weight.\n\nFunctionally, he advocated for universal interoperability: infrared for legacy TVs and Bluetooth for newer devices, ensuring the remote could control multiple pieces of equipment. He questioned whether a hinged or flip\u2011over mechanism would be necessary, ultimately leaning toward a simple, single\u2011piece design that could open to reveal a keypad if needed. He also suggested a simple \u201cpoint\u2011and\u2011click\u201d mode rather than requiring the user to aim the remote, thereby reducing the need for infrared range constraints.\n\nIn summary, Sebastian\u2019s vision for the spherical remote combined a stable, ergonomically\u2011gripped ball shape with a minimal, tactile keypad, backlighting, and dual\u2011mode communication to deliver a cost\u2011effective, user\u2011friendly, and universally compatible product.",
    "The committee\u2019s evidence shows that the Welsh higher\u2011education sector recognises the value of the Erasmus+ programme and the broader mobility funding it provides, but it also admits that the current share of mobility finance that comes from Erasmus is limited \u2013 only about 40\u202f% of the total mobility budget is funded by the EU scheme.  In light of the uncertainty around the future of Erasmus, the sector is encouraging universities to embed a mobility element into their own fee\u2011and\u2011access plans, with seven of the eight universities already including such targets.  The HEFCW stresses that while a replacement scheme would be costly and inefficient, the sector is committed to finding ways to promote and resourced mobility from its own income streams, and that the long\u2011term stability of Erasmus remains a priority.\n\nWhen it comes to tuition\u2011fee refunds, the sector\u2019s position is more cautious.  The committee\u2019s discussion, particularly the question raised by Huw\u202fMorris, was answered by highlighting the existing institutional mechanisms \u2013 quality\u2011assurance reviews, appeal procedures and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator \u2013 that are in place to address any student concerns arising from the pandemic or incomplete courses.  No policy proposal for a blanket refund of tuition fees was offered; instead the focus is on ensuring that students receive fair assessment, that appeals are processed promptly, and that the current fee\u2011and\u2011access framework remains in force.  In short, the group supports the continuation and strengthening of Erasmus mobility, but it does not advocate a general refund of tuition fees, preferring to rely on established safeguards to protect students\u2019 interests.",
    "The committee\u2019s debate covered a wide range of issues, but several themes emerged.  \n\n**Local authoritative frameworks** \u2013 Members repeatedly called for clearer, more coordinated local\u2011level structures, from the powers of municipal councils to the authority of provincial and federal agencies.  Questions were raised about how local authorities are empowered to set and enforce safety standards, to fund and monitor special\u2011needs services, and to coordinate with provincial ministries on issues such as the Canada Emergency Business Account, the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.  The need for a unified, transparent framework that allows local governments to manage funding, workforce planning, and emergency response was a common point of emphasis.  \n\n**Condolences** \u2013 Throughout the session, MPs and ministers offered heartfelt condolences for a number of recent deaths, including local community leaders, educators, and public servants.  The tone was consistently respectful, with many members noting the impact of these losses on their constituencies and on the broader community.  \n\n**Employment** \u2013 The discussion focused heavily on the pandemic\u2011era support programs.  Questions were asked of ministers about the rollout and reach of the wage subsidy, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, and the Canada Emergency Business Account.  MPs highlighted gaps in eligibility, delays in access, and the need for clearer guidance on how businesses can claim support.  The debate also touched on the need for better job creation measures, especially for vulnerable groups such as temporary foreign workers and Indigenous communities.  \n\n**Workers\u2019 safety** \u2013 Safety in the workplace was a recurring topic.  Ministers were questioned about PPE procurement, the protection of frontline workers, and the enforcement of safety regulations in essential industries.  The conversation highlighted the ongoing need for adequate protective equipment, clear health\u2011and\u2011safety guidelines, and the role of government in ensuring safe working conditions during the pandemic.  \n\n**Pay dispute situations** \u2013 Several MPs raised concerns about pay disputes in education and other public services.  The issue of teacher pay settlements, the fairness of wage adjustments for frontline workers, and the handling of pay disputes in the public sector were discussed.  Questions were raised about the processes for negotiating pay, the role of unions, and the need for transparent, timely resolutions to avoid prolonged conflict.",
    "During the 13th meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID\u201119 Pandemic, the Yukon Member of Parliament speaking from Whitehorse offered a double expression of gratitude.  First, he thanked the House of Commons for its continued attention to the crisis and for the collective parliamentary effort to address the pandemic\u2019s impacts on Canadians.  Second, he specifically thanked the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for the \u201cinvaluable assistance\u201d they had provided in long\u2011term care facilities across the country.\n\nThe MP highlighted that the Armed Forces\u2019 observations and testimonies had brought to light the severe conditions endured by seniors in long\u2011term care homes\u2014starvation, abuse, neglect and filth\u2014during the pandemic.  By documenting these realities, the forces helped the House and the public understand the urgency of reforming the long\u2011term care system.  The MP stressed that the Armed Forces\u2019 work was essential to ensuring that no elder would be subjected to such mistreatment again and called for immediate, comprehensive action to protect vulnerable seniors.  In short, the thanks were directed at the House for its role in deliberating the crisis and at the Armed Forces for their frontline documentation and support that revealed the extent of the crisis in long\u2011term care facilities.",
    "The team\u2019s discussion focused on defining a television\u2011only remote that balances simplicity, usability and style while staying within a \u20ac12.50 production cost and a \u20ac25 selling price.  The **prioritized functional requirement** emerged as a **basic \u201cchannel, volume, on/off\u201d set of controls** that must be large, tactile and intuitive; all other functions are considered secondary.  The remote is intended for a broad international market, so the design must be language\u2011neutral, use a universal infrared transmitter, and feature a clear, minimalist interface.  The industrial designer highlighted the importance of a durable, high\u2011quality plastic housing to avoid metal interference and keep costs low.  The user\u2011interface designer proposed a **touch\u2011screen** for secondary functions (menus, settings, voice\u2011recognition options) to keep the physical button set minimal; the screen would display a simple menu hierarchy and allow scrolling through options.\n\nThe **scroll feature** was debated as a way to navigate multiple settings without adding physical buttons.  The consensus was to implement a **scrollable touch area** (e.g., a small circular or rectangular pad) that lets users swipe or tap to move through menu pages.  This would reduce the number of on\u2011remote buttons, keep the device lightweight, and satisfy the usability data showing most users only use a handful of functions.  The team also discussed optional features such as a \u201cfind\u2011remote\u201d button, voice\u2011control for advanced users, and glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark or illuminated buttons for visibility, but these were considered secondary and would be added only if they could be integrated without exceeding the cost target.  Overall, the remote will feature a simple core set of functions, a touch\u2011screen with scrollable menus for extras, and a plastic, ergonomic form that reflects the company\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d brand.",
    "The team\u2019s next meeting will focus on tightening the remote\u2011control concept around three core themes: **functionality, ergonomics, and aesthetics**.  \nMarketing will lead the discussion on **repetitive\u2011strain injury (R_S_I)**, pulling from the usability lab data that showed 65\u202f% of users press the channel\u2011change button more than 60\u202f% of the time and that many users find the current button layout tiring. The group will decide how to reduce button count, enlarge frequently\u2011used controls, and possibly add a quick\u2011access \u201cchannel\u2011change\u201d wheel or touch surface that minimizes wrist movement.  \n\nThe agenda will also cover **voice\u2011recognition**\u2014a feature that younger users (15\u201135\u202fyr) are most enthusiastic about\u2014balanced against the cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50 for production. Marketing will weigh the premium potential against the \u20ac25 selling price, while the industrial designer will evaluate whether a simple voice trigger can be integrated without inflating the bill of materials.  \n\nThe meeting will review the **prototypes** presented last time: the \u201csliding\u2011panel\u201d remote and the LCD\u2011displayed channel list. Feedback will be collected on usability, battery life, and the proposed solar\u2011cell power option (currently a point of contention).  \n\nFinally, the team will reflect on the **progress made in previous meetings**. They noted that while the design sprint produced a working model, communication gaps slowed decision\u2011making, and that the iterative prototype\u2011testing cycle was more productive than the earlier \u201cbrain\u2011storm\u2011then\u2011build\u201d approach. The group will agree on clearer action items, tighter timelines, and a shared documentation hub to prevent the \u201cmissing email\u201d and \u201cblank slide\u201d frustrations that surfaced last time.  \n\nIn short, the upcoming meeting will decide on R_S_I mitigations, finalize feature trade\u2011offs (voice vs. button), lock the budget, and set a process for smoother collaboration moving forward.",
    "The lab study revealed that users are dissatisfied with the clutter of modern remotes: only about 10\u202f% of the buttons are actually used, while 80\u202f% of participants said they would pay extra for a \u201csnazzy\u201d but simpler design.  The most frequent functions were channel change, volume control and power, and the majority of respondents complained about the time it takes to locate the remote on the couch.\n\nDuring the design discussion the team focused on a dedicated *finder* button.  Two options were debated: a small button on the remote that, when pressed, activates a transmitter on the TV (or a separate base) that emits a sound or light to locate the unit, or a button that triggers a \u201ccall\u201d\u2011style signal similar to a mobile phone.  The consensus was to include a finder button, but the call\u2011button concept was abandoned as it added unnecessary complexity.\n\nFor button layout, the group agreed on a minimal set: a joystick or touch pad for channel and volume, a single menu button, and a power button.  Button placement would follow ergonomic principles \u2013 grouped by function and sized for a one\u2011handed grip.  The location function would use a low\u2011power radio transmitter rather than line\u2011of\u2011sight IR, and the remote would provide a buzzer or vibration to indicate its position.  Color and shape were chosen to be distinctive yet not overly flashy, and the design would allow future expansion (e.g., a menu for advanced settings).\n\nWhen the team reviewed the lighting\u2011adaptive feature that had been mentioned in earlier presentations, they agreed that it was not a market\u2011driven priority and would be omitted from the current prototype.  The decision was that adaptive lighting added cost and complexity with little perceived benefit, so the remote would remain a simple, user\u2011friendly device focused on core TV functions.",
    "The team is actively trying to build a robust pipeline for a conversational system that can capture a speaker\u2019s intention and map it onto high\u2011level actions.  They are gathering far\u2011field recordings with **DAT recorders** (the \u201cDAT\u201d data from the Santa\u202fBarbara corpus) and are considering how to adapt this material to their meeting\u2011style audio.  The recordings are multi\u2011channel and will be fed through a custom patch\u2011panel that converts the blue \u201cDAT\u201d cables to the black microphones, supplies phantom power, and lights LEDs to indicate which channels are live.  The power\u2011cable discussion centred on wiring the head\u2011mounted mics, ensuring stable phantom power, and organising the cable bundle so that the system can be re\u2011wired for different rooms.\n\nTo capture intention the group is moving beyond simple keyword spotting.  They are developing a **high\u2011level task hierarchy** (\u201cgo shopping\u201d, \u201cvisit museum\u201d, etc.) that will be linked to action schemas (Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal, forced motion, etc.).  The intention is inferred from the user\u2019s utterance and then translated into a structured action plan.  Capturing the subject\u2019s intention also requires accurate segmentation of speech, so the team is evaluating several analysis approaches:  \n- **Forced alignment** with the SRI recognizer to get precise time stamps;  \n- **Speech\u2011non\u2011speech detection** using a new pre\u2011segmentation module that normalises energy across channels;  \n- **Manual transcription** with the French \u201cTranscriber\u201d tool for fine\u2011grained annotation;  \n- **Cross\u2011correlation** to remove lapel\u2011mic interference;  \n- **Automatic segmentation** for large\u2011scale data, followed by manual correction.  \n\nThe overall strategy is to combine automatic segmentation and forced alignment with manual refinement, then feed the resulting time\u2011aligned transcripts into the intention\u2011capture module that maps utterances to the action\u2011schema hierarchy.  This layered approach should allow the system to recognise not only what is said but also why it is said, a key requirement for the conversational agent they are building.",
    "The team began by reviewing the **general specification** that had been drafted in the first meeting: a remote that supports teletext, a docking station, audio control, a small screen, and a set of essential buttons (power, volume, channel up/down, number pad, and a \u201cfunction\u201d button for subtitles).  The discussion quickly turned to the **case design** and how it could be tailored to the target demographic (sixty\u2011to\u2011eighty\u2011year\u2011olds).\n\nA key decision was that the remote would come with **changeable cases**.  Two colour\u2011coated options were agreed upon \u2013 a wood\u2011like finish for a premium feel and a grey\u2011black finish for a more conventional look.  The team also decided that the cases would be interchangeable on a single\u2011curved body, which would reduce manufacturing complexity compared with a double\u2011curved design.  The idea of adding a rubber anti\u2011slip belt was floated but ultimately dropped because it would drive up cost and add little perceived value.\n\nSeveral **changes to the current design** were debated.  The original plan to include a kinetic\u2011energy charging mechanism was rejected due to cost and user\u2011experience concerns (elderly users would not be inclined to shake the remote).  The LCD display was considered essential for showing channel and volume information, but the team decided to keep it very small and simple, removing any advanced graphics or \u201csmart\u201d features that would have added complexity.  The advanced chip that would enable a full menu system was also removed in favour of a more basic infrared transmitter.  Finally, the docking station was refined to include a single \u201cfind\u2011remote\u201d button that would emit a beep when pressed.\n\nIn summary, the group settled on a single\u2011curved, interchangeable\u2011case remote with a simple LCD, basic button layout, and a cost\u2011conscious docking station, while dropping kinetic power and advanced menu features to stay within budget and usability constraints.",
    "Huw David stressed that the Bill\u2019s primary aim is to give clear, unequivocal protection to children and to close a loophole that still exists in Welsh law. He warned that any unintended consequences would arise mainly from poor implementation rather than from the legislation itself, and that the key to avoiding them is robust resourcing and training across all frontline services. David argued that the cultural shift away from corporal punishment has already been underway for decades; the Bill is simply a formal recognition of that change, not a radical new policy. He therefore sees the need for legislation not as a response to a sudden spike in abuse but as a formal codification of a society that increasingly rejects physical punishment. \n\nRegarding the wording of the Bill, David expressed a clear preference for the legislation to explicitly commit Welsh Government ministers to an awareness\u2011raising campaign. He noted that while the explanatory memorandum already references the need for education and support, embedding a duty on the face of the Bill would make the expectation unmistakable and would help prevent the perception that parents are being criminalised. He concluded that the Bill should therefore include an explicit provision requiring ministers to promote the Bill\u2019s objectives, thereby reinforcing the cultural change and ensuring that the law is understood and applied consistently.",
    "The team agreed that the two\u2011sided remote should be a **simple, ergonomic \u201cbanana\u2011shaped\u201d device** with only four push\u2011buttons (up, down, left, right) and a single on\u2011off switch.  The design was intended to be **minimalist and user\u2011friendly** \u2013 the banana curve was chosen to give a natural grip, while a contrasting yellow\u2011with\u2011black\u2011buttons scheme matched the company\u2019s colours.  Two material options were discussed: a hard, smooth plastic for durability or a softer, rubberised cover for a \u201cspongy\u201d feel.  The consensus was that a **single\u2011curved, flat case** would be easiest to manufacture and keep costs under the \u20ac12.50 target.\n\nIn terms of **functionality** the remote would use a simple infrared transmitter powered by a small battery (or kinetic energy via a crank), with no voice or internet features.  The focus was on controlling the TV only, with a **child\u2011lock** and a **LED back\u2011light** for night\u2011time use.  The group also debated adding a **water\u2011proof enclosure** so the remote could be used in the bathroom, and ensuring it was **shock\u2011proof** to survive accidental drops.\n\nThe **evaluation criteria** set by marketing were: fancy/elegant, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, and sellable.  The remote was judged as \u201cfancy\u201d in the sense of being stylish, \u201ctechnologically innovative\u201d only in its simple menu navigation, and \u201ceasy to use\u201d due to the limited button count.  The group concluded that the device would appeal to a **broad market** (children, elderly, and general consumers) but could be offered in a few shape/colour variants to cater to sub\u2011segments without exceeding the budget.  Overall, the design was seen as a cost\u2011effective, market\u2011ready solution that meets the required water\u2011proof and shock\u2011proof standards.",
    "Group\u202f3 of the Stage\u202f2 debate centred on the extent of regulation\u2011making powers that the Welsh Government would retain in the Bill. The Deputy Minister (Julie\u202fMorgan) maintained that the Bill already gives the government the necessary powers to make statutory instruments and to bring the core provision into force, and that any further powers should be limited to transitory, transitional or saving provisions. She argued that the current framework was sufficient for implementing the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment and that the Assembly would retain the ability to scrutinise any regulatory proposals.\n\nAmendment\u202f3, moved by the Deputy Minister, simply restored the power for the Welsh Ministers to make an order for commencement, a power that had been removed in earlier drafts. Suzy\u202fDavies moved Amendment\u202f3A, which probed whether the Welsh Government should be granted broader regulation\u2011making powers beyond the narrow powers already in place. Davies cautioned that giving the Welsh Government unrestricted regulatory powers would effectively hand control over to non\u2011devolved bodies such as the Crown\u202fProsecution\u202fService (CPS) or the police. She argued that the Assembly should not be able to rely on the Welsh Government to shape CPS guidance or police thresholds, as this would place the Welsh legislature in a position of influence over independent agencies. Davies also stressed the need for clear Assembly scrutiny of any regulatory powers and for the powers to be limited to what is strictly necessary to implement the Bill.\n\nThe debate ended with the Minister indicating that Amendment\u202f3A would be considered at Stage\u202f3, while the Deputy Minister reaffirmed that the existing powers were adequate and that the Assembly would continue to scrutinise any regulatory activity.",
    "Brexit has already begun to alter the financial and operational landscape for Welsh universities.  The loss of EU\u2011funding streams \u2013 from student grants to research programmes \u2013 has forced institutions to revise their fee\u2011and\u2011access plans for 2019\u201120 and beyond.  In the committee hearing, Dr\u202fDavid\u202fBlaney and Bethan\u202fOwen noted that EU\u2011student applications to Wales fell 8\u202f% (against a 2\u202f% rise in England), and that five universities have already inserted explicit \u201cBrexit\u2011impact\u201d clauses into their fee plans.  These clauses allow the universities to shift costs, negotiate alternative funding, and, where necessary, revise tuition levels while keeping the overall fee structure stable.  Executives are also running scenario\u2011based planning: they maintain contingency budgets, monitor changes in EU\u2011research funding (Horizon Europe), and work with the Welsh Government\u2019s Higher\u2011Education Brexit Working Group to secure transition funding under the Diamond and Reid reports.  Student protection is reinforced through the Welsh student charter and the UK quality code, which guarantee that students already enrolled can finish programmes even if a provider faces financial distress.\n\nIn the Canadian committee, the question on local PPE production was answered with a mix of progress and plans.  The federal government has signed contracts with domestic manufacturers \u2013 Medicom for N95 masks, a local firm (Novo Textiles) for surgical masks, and a GM\u2011led plant for gowns \u2013 and has distributed over 100\u202fmillion surgical masks to provinces.  The minister reiterated that expanding domestic PPE capacity remains a priority and that further contracts are being negotiated.\n\nRegarding projects awaiting provincial approval, the minister acknowledged that a number of infrastructure and recovery projects are \u201cin the pipeline\u201d and that the federal government is working with provincial ministries to fast\u2011track approvals.  While a precise count was not disclosed, the commitment was to review and approve pending projects in the coming weeks to avoid delays that could stall economic recovery.",
    "The committee\u2019s discussion made clear that the \u201cmiddle tier\u201d \u2013 the network of regional school\u2011improvement services, local authorities and consortia \u2013 is being positioned as a key partner in the Welsh Government\u2019s reform agenda.  It is now expected to play a dual role: (1) **self\u2011evaluation and data\u2011driven oversight** \u2013 working with Estyn, the OECD and school leaders to develop robust, school\u2011specific evaluation tools, and (2) **early intervention and support** \u2013 using the powers in the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act to intervene in schools that are at risk, with a new multi\u2011agency panel that includes local authorities, regional consortia, Estyn and the Welsh Government to move schools out of special measures more quickly.  The middle tier is also being asked to help coordinate resources (e.g., specialist HR and governor support) and to ensure consistency across the 22 local authorities, a task that has already seen some success in the education sector.\n\nFor elderly and vulnerable Canadians, the government is deploying a range of targeted supports.  The **Pupil Development Grant** and the **Minority\u2011Ethnic Achievement Grant** are earmarked to close attainment gaps for children in need.  For looked\u2011after children, a new **Pupil Development Grant \u2013 Looked\u2011After Children (PDG\u2011LAC)** has been set up.  Seniors are receiving a **$500 tax\u2011free payment** (up to $300 for OAS recipients and $200 for GIS recipients), an expansion of the **New Horizons for Seniors** program, and a **$20\u202fmillion** boost to support services such as grocery delivery and connectivity.  The government is also working on **universal pharmacare** and stronger national standards for long\u2011term care, with federal funding tied to enforcement.  Across all these initiatives, the emphasis is on early identification, coordinated support, and a shift from reactive to proactive care for the most vulnerable.",
    "The marketing voice in the meeting is the most strategic and future\u2011oriented.  It sees the remote not simply as a controller but as a \u201csmart, personal\u201d device that can *recognize* the user.  The team talks about adding speech\u2011recognition that is speaker\u2011dependent, so the remote can learn who is speaking, remember that person\u2019s favourite channels, volume habits and even suggest personalised menus.  The marketing expert argues that this level of user identification will be a key differentiator in a crowded market and could become a strong selling point for the \u201cpremium\u201d segment.  \n\nOn the product side, the marketing perspective is that the remote must combine three core attributes: a *fancy, fashionable* look, *technological innovation*, and *ease of use*.  It should look like a \u201cfruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable\u201d style, spongy rubber or titanium, with optional colour variations that customers could pay extra for.  The remote should be priced between \u20ac35 and \u20ac50, positioning it as an exclusive but still attainable product, and it should offer a lifetime guarantee to reinforce trust.  The marketing team is open to an upgradable design that allows future features to be added without a full redesign, but stresses that any upgrades must not compromise the simplicity that users expect.  Finally, the marketing expert stresses that the remote should feel \u201cproud to own\u201d \u2013 a device that users can identify with and brag about, rather than a purely functional tool.",
    "The post\u2011legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was framed around three inter\u2011linked themes: **universal adoption, the Act\u2019s advantages and its weaknesses**.\n\n**Universal adoption**  \n- The Minister stated that the Act was designed to apply to all Welsh higher\u2011education institutions, but that its reach is limited to those that receive public funding and are registered as charities.  \n- The Act is being \u201csuperseded\u201d by a new Post\u2011Compulsory Education and Training (PCET) Bill, which will broaden the regulatory net to cover the whole post\u2011compulsory sector, not just universities.  \n- The discussion highlighted that the Act has not yet achieved a truly universal regulatory regime because it does not cover the small number of private providers that can operate outside the charity requirement.\n\n**Advantages**  \n- The Act was introduced to **regulate institutions, safeguard the public good of government funding, preserve fair access, and protect institutional autonomy**.  \n- It gives the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) a range of powers \u2013 from conditions on funding to sanctions \u2013 to influence outcomes.  \n- The Minister stressed that the Act remains a \u201cproportionate\u201d system that protects the reputation of Welsh universities while allowing them to maintain autonomy.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \n- **Limited enforcement power** \u2013 HEFCW\u2019s powers are seen as \u201cthreatening\u201d and cumbersome; the Act lacks a graduated, soft\u2011to\u2011hard escalation regime, making swift intervention difficult.  \n- **Reliance on remit letters** \u2013 National priorities are often pushed through HEFCW\u2019s annual remit letters rather than hard legislative levers, raising questions about the Act\u2019s ability to impose national outcomes.  \n- **Inadequate coverage of private and alternative providers** \u2013 The Act\u2019s charity requirement excludes many private providers, limiting regulation and oversight.  \n- **Governance and quality\u2011assurance gaps** \u2013 The Act does not directly address governance issues; an independent review is needed, and a single quality\u2011assurance body is still under discussion.  \n- **Future\u2011proofing** \u2013 The Act was not designed to anticipate rapid changes in the sector (e.g., the rise of part\u2011time and work\u2011based learning, TNE), and the new PCET Bill is expected to address these gaps.\n\nIn sum, the meeting underscored that while the Act succeeded in setting a proportional regulatory framework and preserving autonomy, it falls short on enforcement, coverage, governance, and adaptability \u2013 all of which the forthcoming PCET Bill aims to strengthen.",
    "During the session Cat opened the agenda by presenting the formal evaluation criteria that the team would use to judge the banana\u2011shaped remote prototype. The criteria were scored on a 1\u2011to\u20117 scale (1 = fully met, 7 = not met), and the group agreed to evaluate each aspect individually before averaging the results.  \n\nThe discussion then turned to the actual prototype. The industrial designer described the three prototype shapes (potato, rhombus, banana) and the button layout (four push\u2011buttons, two scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a central menu button). The user interface specialist explained how the scroll wheel would handle volume, channel, and teletext navigation, while the marketing lead highlighted the importance of the \u201cfruit\u201d aesthetic\u2014yellow, black, or more subdued corporate colors\u2014and the potential for a locator feature to prevent loss.  \n\nWhen scoring, the team considered:  \n\n* **Functionality** \u2013 the remote performs all required tasks; most members gave it a 1 or 2.  \n* **Ease of use / learnability** \u2013 the scroll wheel and dual\u2011function buttons were noted as slightly steep for first\u2011time users, earning a 3\u20114.  \n* **Ergonomics / spongy feel** \u2013 the rubber/latex material was praised for comfort (score 1).  \n* **Fruit integration** \u2013 the banana theme scored high (1\u20112) but some argued that a more neutral design could broaden appeal.  \n* **Left\u2011handed friendliness** \u2013 the team debated a mirrored version; scores hovered around 5.  \n* **Aesthetic & fashion** \u2013 the \u201cfancy\u201d look was valued (score 2), though some felt it was too gimmicky.  \n\nThe group also discussed budget constraints, noting that removing the sample speaker and simplifying the scroll wheel could keep the cost under the \u20ac12.5 target. They agreed to document the average score and to revisit the criteria if the prototype fell outside acceptable ranges. The session ended with a consensus that the evaluation process was thorough but would benefit from a focus group test with the target demographic in the next iteration.",
    "**CD backup** \u2013 The group was divided on whether to use CD\u2011ROMs for archiving the meeting corpus.  Some participants (grad\u202fa, grad\u202fb) noted that CD\u2011ROMs are the standard medium for public releases (e.g., LDC distributions) and are inexpensive, but they raised the well\u2011known issue that CDs wear out after a few years of use.  Others (grad\u202ff, grad\u202fd, grad\u202fb) argued that a single copy on CD is risky and suggested a hybrid scheme: keep the master on a non\u2011backed\u2011up disk, then burn a copy to CD annually for public distribution while keeping an archival copy on tape.  The consensus was that tape would be the long\u2011term backup medium, with CDs used only for \u201cpublic\u201d releases, and that any CD copies should be re\u2011burned on a regular schedule.\n\n**Probability computation** \u2013 The discussion centered on how to combine evidence in the belief\u2011net that models user intentions (go, view, tango).  Professor\u202fb and grad\u202fa proposed a simple weighted\u2011average approach, treating each evidence source as an \u201cexpert\u201d and assigning equal or data\u2011driven weights.  Grad\u202fd introduced the idea of a hidden variable\u202fH (a mixture\u2011of\u2011experts node) that selects the most reliable source in a given context, thereby allowing the CPTs to be smaller and more interpretable.  Participants debated whether to use equal weights or to learn the weights from data, and whether to model the conditional probabilities explicitly or rely on a voting scheme.  The general agreement was to start with a simple weighted average, then move to a mixture\u2011of\u2011experts formulation once sufficient training data are available.\n\n**Computer navigation system** \u2013 Professor\u202fc described the experimental set\u2011up: an instrumented room with tabletop microphones, high\u2011quality pressure\u2011zone mics, and close\u2011talking mics all recorded in parallel to provide both ground\u2011truth and far\u2011field audio.  Digit strings (identical to the TI\u2011digits corpus) were read aloud for alignment, and participants signed consent forms and were anonymized in transcripts.  The goal is to build a portable PDA\u2011based navigation system that can infer user intent from contextual features (Vista, Enter, Tango modes).  The set\u2011up is intended to support beam\u2011forming, speech recognition, and intent inference, with the recorded data to be released publicly (via LDC) after proper anonymization.",
    "The team rejected the idea of placing identical \u201cchannel\u2011up\u201d and \u201cvolume\u2011up\u201d buttons on both sides of the remote for two main reasons. First, the prototype already had a highly ergonomic layout that matched the natural thumb\u2011to\u2011index\u2011to\u2011middle\u2011to\u2011ring\u2011finger sequence, so duplicating the controls would have created visual clutter without a clear usability gain. Second, adding a mirrored set of buttons would have forced a new production path\u2014two distinct molds, two sets of parts, and extra quality\u2011control checks\u2014while the market research showed that the vast majority of users were right\u2011handed and would not need a separate left\u2011handed version. The industrial designer noted that \u201cpeople can use the same remote\u201d and that \u201cleft\u2011handed users are a minority\u201d so the extra cost was unjustified.\n\nWhen the Project Manager suggested creating a dedicated right\u2011handed and left\u2011handed remote during the prototype presentation, the team was initially intrigued but ultimately skeptical. Marketing pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s only pressing buttons, you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d implying that the existing layout could accommodate both hands if needed. The UI lead argued that a single, mirrored remote would be \u201ca little too complex\u201d for the target age group. The consensus was that while a left\u2011handed variant was technically feasible, it would add unnecessary complexity and expense. Thus, the proposal was shelved in favor of a single, ergonomically\u2011optimized design that could serve both hands with minimal adjustment.",
    "During the design review the team agreed that the only viable way to meet the \u20ac12.50 production\u2011cost target was to cut several premium features and simplify the hardware.  \n**Feature eliminations**  \n- **Solar cells** \u2013 removed to avoid the extra module and wiring.  \n- **Voice\u2011recognition** \u2013 dropped because the cost of the processor, microphone and training software would push the price above budget.  \n- **Special colour (yellow) and the \u201cbanana\u201d curve** \u2013 discarded because the colour was not essential to function and the curved housing would require a custom mould, adding tooling costs.  \n- **Titanium housing, double\u2011curved case and kinetic\u2011energy source** \u2013 all considered too expensive for the intended price point and were therefore omitted.  \n\n**Cost\u2011saving measures**  \n- Switch from a rubber cover to a plain plastic shell for the basic unit, while still keeping rubber for optional custom covers to preserve a \u201cspongy\u201d feel that customers liked.  \n- Keep a single LCD display and a minimal set of push\u2011buttons (channel, favourite, mute) rather than a full menu system.  \n- Use a standard LCD panel and a generic push\u2011button frame to avoid custom parts.  \n- Offer interchangeable covers as a post\u2011sale add\u2011on; this allows the core product to remain cheap while still giving customers a design choice.  \n\n**Resulting product**  \nThe final design contains an LCD, a small set of essential buttons, a plastic shell, and optional rubber covers. Speech\u2011recognition, solar power, and premium materials are omitted, keeping the unit\u2019s cost under \u20ac12.50 while retaining the core functionality expected by users. The decision was driven by the need to stay profitable and the lack of detailed cost data early in the project, leading to a lean, cost\u2011focused design.",
    "**Pros of voice recognition highlighted in the meeting**\n\n* **Market appeal** \u2013 A significant portion of the target group (15\u201135\u202fyear\u2011olds) expressed a strong willingness to try voice\u2011enabled devices; the survey data showed a high willingness to pay for \u201chigh\u2011tech\u201d features.  \n* **Accessibility** \u2013 The team noted that voice control could help users with physical disabilities, adding an inclusive selling point.  \n* **Convenience** \u2013 Voice input would eliminate the need to hold the remote, making the device feel more \u201chands\u2011free\u201d and modern.  \n* **Brand differentiation** \u2013 Adding speech recognition would reinforce the company\u2019s \u201cfashionable electronics\u201d positioning and could become a key marketing hook.\n\n**Cons and concerns raised**\n\n* **Technology maturity** \u2013 A team member had seen a prototype that required the user to yell for hours, indicating current voice\u2011recognition accuracy is low.  \n* **Cost & complexity** \u2013 Embedding a microphone, processor, and power\u2011management circuitry would raise component costs and add design complexity, potentially delaying time\u2011to\u2011market.  \n* **Power consumption** \u2013 Continuous listening would drain batteries faster; the group debated whether a rechargeable unit or standard batteries were appropriate.  \n* **Infra\u2011red line\u2011of\u2011sight** \u2013 Even if voice is used, the remote still needs to transmit IR signals; a user speaking to the remote may inadvertently block the line of sight, causing control failures.  \n* **User acceptance** \u2013 Some argued that basic functions (volume, channel) could be handled with simple buttons, and that adding voice recognition might be unnecessary \u201cover\u2011engineering\u201d for the core user base.\n\nIn short, the team saw voice recognition as a potentially high\u2011impact, market\u2011driven feature but flagged significant technical, cost, and usability hurdles that would need to be overcome before it could be shipped.",
    "During the design talks the battery issue was a recurring theme.  \nThe industrial designer opened the discussion by listing the **general requirements** for the power source: it must be small enough to fit the slim, flip\u2011top form factor, cheap enough for a \u20ac25 retail price, and long\u2011lasting so that users do not have to change cells constantly. He noted that the standard **double\u2011A** cells are the most common in households, but they are relatively bulky and would increase the remote\u2019s size. **Triple\u2011A** cells are smaller and would keep the unit more compact, yet they are still a significant fraction of the device\u2019s volume and would require a larger battery compartment.\n\nThe designer weighed the **benefits and drawbacks** of each option. Triple\u2011As offer a slimmer profile and are widely available, but they consume power quickly if the remote is used frequently. Double\u2011As are easier to find but would make the remote feel heavier. He also explored **rechargeable alternatives** \u2013 a kinetic (wind\u2011up) cell that could be charged by movement, a solar cell that would recharge during daytime use, and a standard rechargeable lithium cell. All of these would eliminate the need to purchase new batteries, but the kinetic and solar solutions would add extra weight, cost, and complexity, and the remote\u2019s thin design would not accommodate the larger cells required.\n\nTo **conserve battery life**, the industrial designer suggested a standby mode that would shut down the LED back\u2011lights after a short period of inactivity, and a simple button\u2011layout that would minimise power draw. He also proposed that the remote include a small charger or docking station, so that users could charge it like a mobile phone instead of swapping out cells.\n\nIn the end, the team decided to go with **triple\u2011A cells** for the final prototype, keeping the remote lightweight and inexpensive. The industrial designer\u2019s recommendation for a **charger rather than a built\u2011in battery** in the industrial working design stemmed from the need for a reliable, low\u2011maintenance power source that could be reused across many units, reducing both cost and waste in an industrial setting.",
    "The group decided to include the project in a conference paper mainly because it would serve as a formal record of the work, a vehicle for sharing a novel approach with the wider research community, and a means of gaining external validation.  They wanted to document the interdisciplinary nature of the system\u2014combining construction\u2011grammar analysis, Bayesian belief\u2011net inference, ontology lookup, and discourse tracking\u2014so that others could see how these components interact to resolve \u201cwhere\u2011is\u2011X\u201d queries.  By framing the project as a position paper that highlights the conceptual novelty (e.g., treating a single construction as a dual\u2011intent node that activates both \u201cinformation\u2011on\u201d and \u201cgo\u2011there\u201d in the belief net), the team could showcase a fresh perspective on an otherwise well\u2011studied problem.  \n\nPublishing would also provide a platform for feedback on the design choices, such as the decision to keep the paper concise (four\u2011page limit) while still referencing relevant cognitive and neural literature.  The conference\u2019s interdisciplinary audience (cognitive, neural, computational linguistics) was seen as an ideal venue to attract collaborators, secure citations, and potentially influence future research directions.  Finally, a conference paper would create a tangible milestone in the project\u2019s timeline, helping to motivate the team, attract funding, and demonstrate progress to stakeholders (e.g., project managers, supervisors).  In short, the paper was intended to document, disseminate, validate, and promote the project\u2019s innovative integration of linguistic, probabilistic, and ontological techniques.",
    "Kirsty\u202fWilliams said the money that has been earmarked for the Welsh\u2011language consortia is meant to support professional learning and the delivery of the Welsh\u202fBaccalaureate, not to fund new programmes outright.  She pointed out that the \u00a35\u202fmillion earmarked for the Global\u202fWales initiative and the \u00a33.5\u202fmillion for the \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d programme are being routed through the same consortia mechanism so that schools can use the funds to build teaching capacity and improve the quality of the Baccalaureate experience.  She stressed that any additional consortia support would be directed by the regional challenge advisers and the head\u2011teachers, with the goal of raising the standard of the qualification across the board.\n\nOn governance, Williams said there is no blanket policy that imposes a new set of rules on universities.  Instead, she highlighted an independent review of governance chaired by Gillian\u202fCamm, which is already underway.  She indicated that the forthcoming PCET Bill will allow the new commission to introduce a regulatory condition on good governance, but that she has no intention of imposing punitive measures without first working with universities and HEFCW to agree on a shared framework.\n\nWhen asked about mergers, Williams made it clear that she is \u201cagnostic\u201d \u2013 there is no policy to push universities together.  She acknowledged the past debate over the Cardiff\u202fMet/Glasgow merger and said that any decision to merge must be made by the institutions themselves, with the government\u2019s role limited to ensuring that any re\u2011configuration is robust and student\u2011centric.\n\nRegarding admission problems, Williams reiterated that universities already operate under fee\u2011and\u2011access plans and that the new PCET Bill will introduce outcome agreements to link funding to measurable outcomes.  She called for greater data collection on who is admitted, how they progress and where they end up, especially for under\u2011represented groups, and urged the sector to use that evidence to adjust admissions criteria, widen access and ensure that the Welsh\u202fBaccalaureate is counted as a genuine university\u2011level qualification rather than a \u201cyes/no\u201d add\u2011on.",
    "The team\u2019s final meeting focused on locking down the core features of the new TV remote.  \n**Energy source** \u2013 After debating solar cells, hand\u2011dynamo, kinetic and conventional batteries, the group settled on a lithium\u2011ion battery as the primary power source. The kinetic \u201cshake\u2011to\u2011charge\u201d idea was shelved because it would add weight and complexity. The remote will therefore be a simple, battery\u2011powered unit that can be recharged via a standard charger.  \n\n**Technological innovation** \u2013 The remote incorporates several first\u2011time elements: a scroll\u2011wheel on each side, a central power button, LED illumination on all contacts, and a lightweight, double\u2011curved latex shell that can be swapped in different fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable patterns. Voice\u2011recognition was considered but ultimately rejected as a primary feature; instead a simple \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d sensor (similar to key\u2011finders) is included to locate the remote when lost. The prototype also uses a single integrated IR chip and a minimal circuit board, keeping costs low while still delivering a \u201ctech\u2011savvy\u201d feel.  \n\n**Overall evaluation** \u2013 The prototype scored well on ergonomics (easy to hold, intuitive button placement) but received lower marks for fashion (only a single color option) and left\u2011hand friendliness. The team agreed to produce both right\u2011 and left\u2011handed versions. Cost analysis confirmed the design stays under the \u20ac12\u201150 target, and the product meets the evaluation criteria for innovation, usability, and marketability. The decision was to move forward to production, with the next steps being final CAD, tooling, and a marketing launch plan.",
    "During the meeting the team spent a large portion of time wrestling with the technical details that would define the remote\u2019s core functionality.  The discussion moved from the type of input \u2013 simple push\u2011buttons versus scroll\u2011wheel or touch\u2011screen \u2013 to the electronics stack.  They debated a chip\u2011on\u2011print solution versus separate chips, the need for an infrared transmitter, and whether to add a small LCD or LED lighting for feedback.  Cost and ergonomics were the main drivers: fewer buttons meant a cheaper board, but a lock\u2011button or a \u201cquiet\u2011mode\u201d switch was considered to reduce repetitive\u2011strain injury.  The team also toyed with more advanced options such as voice\u2011recognition or a tiny speaker, but consensus was that the extra expense would outweigh the perceived benefit for a simple TV remote.\n\nEnergy sourcing was another hot topic.  The options on the table were a standard battery, a hand\u2011dynamo, a kinetic (squeeze\u2011powered) generator, and solar cells.  Solar was dismissed as impractical indoors, and the hand\u2011dynamo was considered too bulky.  The kinetic, rubber\u2011case solution emerged as the most appealing: the remote would be made from a squeezable rubber shell that could recharge the battery simply by being pressed, thus providing an anti\u2011RSII \u201ctherapeutic\u201d feature and keeping the cost low.\n\nThe project announcement email was agreed to be the next step.  The project manager would send an email to each role (industrial designer, UI designer, marketing) outlining the new requirements \u2013 no teletext, focus on TV only, target under\u201140 users, and a recognisable corporate image \u2013 and reminding everyone to prepare their individual presentations for the next meeting.\n\nFinally, the \u201csample sensor\u201d that had been developed for a coffee\u2011machine prototype was discussed.  It was a small sensor/speaker that could respond to voice commands.  The team judged it too expensive and not particularly useful for a TV remote, so they decided to drop it from the current design, noting that it could be revisited in a future, more advanced product.",
    "In the last meeting the team reviewed the progress of the new ergonomic remote\u2011control prototype and addressed several key design and process issues. The remote was praised for its double\u2011curved, rubber\u2011coated body that offers a \u201cspongy\u201d feel and easy button access (thumb power, index channel\u2011up, middle channel\u2011down, ring volume\u2011up, pinkie volume\u2011down, lock button, numeric keypad). The design team highlighted the need to produce both left\u2011 and right\u2011handed versions, a decision that would increase production complexity but was deemed necessary for market acceptance.  \n\nA major technical discussion focused on the proposed kinetic\u2011energy \u201csolar\u2011cell\u201d power source. While the solar panel was a strong marketing hook, it pushed the unit\u2019s cost above the \u20ac12,500 target. The team debated removing the solar element or simplifying the battery system to stay within budget, noting that doing so would weaken the eco\u2011friendly selling point.  \n\nVoice\u2011recognition was identified as the flagship innovation, but concerns about cost, voice\u2011matching accuracy, and the need for a backup signal (beep or light) when the remote is lost were raised. The group also noted that the prototype\u2019s pull\u2011out panel needed refinement for usability.  \n\nProcess\u2011related problems emerged: inconsistent communication (missing slides, unclear email updates), limited collaborative brainstorming, and a perception that the final evaluation focused more on the product\u2019s technical merits than on the overall project management. The meeting concluded with a commitment to refine the left\u2011handed variant, revisit the power\u2011source strategy, and improve team coordination for the next design sprint.",
    "Hefin\u202fDavid\u202fAM and Huw\u202fIrranca\u2011Davies highlighted a handful of inter\u2011linked concerns about the new childcare offer, even as they insisted the single \u00a34.50\u202fper\u2011hour rate should be kept.\n\n**1.  Administrative burden and clarity of the scheme**  \n*\u202fHefin warned that the current pilot process is \u201cbureaucratic\u201d \u2013 parents must provide pay slips, birth certificates, and other paperwork, and that the paperwork is especially heavy for families in the early implementer areas.  \n*\u202fHe questioned whether the fee and access plans are clear enough for families to understand what they can claim and when, and whether the system will be simple enough for local authorities to run at scale.\n\n**2.  Affordability for the lowest\u2011income working families**  \n*\u202fBoth men stressed that the \u00a34.50 rate is designed to be \u201caffordable\u201d, but they acknowledged that the add\u2011on costs (food, transport, extra hours) could still be a barrier for the poorest parents.  \n*\u202fHefin asked whether the scheme would be \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for the lowest\u2011income families and whether the rate would need to be reviewed as costs rise (living wage increases, inflation).  \n*\u202fHuw admitted that the \u201cEasyJet\u2011style\u201d model could leave poorer parents with fewer options and that any rise in the rate would have to be justified against the need to keep the offer attractive for low\u2011income workers.\n\n**3.  Pilots in Cardiff and Newport \u2013 a test of cost and quality**  \n*\u202fHefin pointed out that the scheme is still in early pilots and that the cost of running it in high\u2011cost areas such as Cardiff and Newport might be higher than in rural or valley areas.  \n*\u202fHuw explained that the pilots are being rolled out gradually, first in less expensive areas, and that the outcomes of the pilots will determine whether the \u00a34.50 rate is sustainable in more expensive markets.  \n*\u202fBoth men noted that the pilots also test the quality of care \u2013 the \u201cEasyJet\u201d concern \u2013 and that the scheme will only be rolled out further if providers can meet the required quality standards.\n\n**4.  Qualification and quality of the workforce**  \n*\u202fHuw stressed the need for a \u201cqualified, well\u2011trained\u201d workforce, noting that the \u00a34.50 rate must cover staff wages and that the scheme will be tied to registered, inspected providers.  \n*\u202fHe highlighted the 10\u2011year workforce development plan and the need for training in Welsh\u2011medium provision, and that any increase in the rate would have to be balanced against the need to pay staff adequately.  \n*\u202fBoth men expressed concern that without a robust quality\u2011assurance framework, the scheme could end up providing cheap, low\u2011quality care that would undermine its affordability and effectiveness for the target families.\n\n**5.  Maintaining the rate at \u00a34.50**  \n*\u202fHefin asked whether the rate would be reviewed as costs rise, while Huw said the rate is \u201cfixed for the foreseeable future\u201d but that the scheme will be monitored and adjusted if the pilots show that the cost of delivering quality care in high\u2011cost areas is higher.  \n*\u202fBoth agreed that the rate must remain low enough to keep the offer attractive for the lowest\u2011income working families, but also high enough to ensure a skilled workforce and quality care.\n\nIn short, Hefin and Huw are concerned that the \u00a34.50 rate, while a cornerstone of the policy, must be supported by clear, simple eligibility rules; a robust quality\u2011assurance system; a realistic assessment of cost in high\u2011cost areas; and a workforce that is properly trained and paid. They insist that any adjustment to the rate must be evidence\u2011based and proportionate to the need to keep the scheme affordable for the families it is designed to help.",
    "The meeting began with PhD\u202fC presenting his work on **online normalization** for the Aurora task. He explained that he was using two separate running means\u2014one for silence and one for speech\u2014and that the mean estimates for C\u20110 and C\u20111 differed markedly. He noted that C\u20111\u2019s trajectory was oddly shaped, varying with the noise type, and that a fixed time constant was too slow at the start of utterances, so he tried a smaller, adaptive constant that capped at a threshold after about one second. PhD\u202fC also tried a \u201cnoise\u2011compensation\u201d trick: adding white noise 15\u202fdB below the utterance\u2019s peak energy, which produced smoother MFCCs and did not hurt recognition. The professor (Prof\u202fB) echoed the idea of looking at error types, suggesting that different normalization settings could raise insertions while lowering deletions, and proposed a simple energy\u2011based threshold to \u201cwhiten\u201d silence portions. He also highlighted that training and testing with the same noise model can mask problems, so the smoothing technique was viewed as a first\u2011order fix rather than a cure.\n\nThe discussion then turned to **phase normalization**. PhD\u202fF reported that his long\u2011term mean\u2011subtraction approach yielded garbage results, and grad\u202fG described experiments unwrapping phase and adding modulo\u20112\u03c0 adjustments, which also degraded performance. The professor was skeptical, noting that unwrapping with a na\u00efve Matlab routine made things worse and that the average complex spectrum might not be worth removing. He suggested exploring complex\u2011domain methods that directly divide out the mean complex spectrum instead of taking logs, but cautioned about scaling issues.\n\nRegarding **qualifications**, the only mention was grad\u202fA\u2019s \u201cquals preparation\u201d note; neither PhD\u202fC nor the professor spoke about PhD\u202fC\u2019s quals. Thus, the meeting\u2019s focus remained on the technical challenges of online and phase normalization rather than on qualification exams.",
    "During the meeting the group converged on a strategy for extracting *important linguistic features* from the raw audio and for representing them in a way that would support both automatic recognition and linguistic analysis.  The core idea is to treat the acoustic signal as a *feature stream* that can be split into multiple, overlapping sub\u2011streams (e.g., different frequency bands, phonetic classes, or articulatory cues).  Each sub\u2011stream produces a binary or soft decision about a particular linguistic property (sonorant, voicing, nasality, etc.).  These decisions are then fused by a *soft \u201cAND\u201d* that captures the joint evidence across cues, followed by a *soft \u201cOR\u201d* that aggregates the multiple band\u2011specific evidence for a single target.  The hidden variable that represents the true linguistic state is learned with an EM procedure, which allows the system to weight each cue according to its reliability rather than forcing equal influence.\n\nA key part of the fusion framework is the use of *Noisy\u2011OR* models.  The Noisy\u2011OR offers a compact, interpretable way to combine many binary evidences into a single probability of the target event.  It reduces the number of parameters dramatically compared with a full conditional probability table, while still capturing the intuition that any one strong cue can \u201cturn on\u201d the target.  This makes it especially attractive for the multi\u2011stream architecture where many cues are available.\n\nFinally, the transcription formalization was discussed as the bridge between the raw audio and the feature\u2011based model.  The team agreed on a two\u2011stage script pipeline that first converts the raw transcripts into a *recognizer\u2011ready* format (removing non\u2011speech, normalizing numbers, etc.) and then into a *linguistics\u2011ready* format (preserving glosses, NUMS tags, and other discourse markers).  This formalization ensures that the same source data can be used both for training the Noisy\u2011OR Bayes nets and for downstream linguistic evaluation, while keeping the representations consistent across the two domains.",
    "During the meeting the group discussed several technical and administrative items that affect how the project\u2019s system is used in demos, how data are backed up, how notes are collected, and how future meetings will be scheduled.  \n\n**System involvement in demos** \u2013 The team reviewed the current demo setup, noting that the Transcriber/Tcl\u2011TK interface can be shown with the waveform and prosodic plots.  They discussed adding a second window to display additional signals and the feasibility of porting the interface to a Windows laptop (the team confirmed that the Snack/Transcriber stack now works on Windows).  The demo was to include XML\u2011based transcription data and the new prosodic visualizations, but the group agreed that the demo will be trimmed if time does not allow for a fully live display.  \n\n**Backups** \u2013 Backup strategy was a major agenda item.  The discussion centered on whether the meeting data should be stored on the non\u2011backed\u2011up \u201cAbbott\u201d server or on new disk racks.  Dave Johnson was identified as the person who would negotiate disk space, but the consensus was that the data should be kept on a non\u2011backed\u2011up disk until a new backup system is in place, and that an incremental backup plan will be added once the new disks are available.  The group also agreed to maintain a manual archive copy for redundancy.  \n\n**Collecting notes** \u2013 The CrossPad note\u2011taking device was reviewed.  The team noted that while the device can time\u2011stamp notes, it adds infrastructure overhead and few people actually use it.  A PDA\u2011based note system was suggested as a lighter alternative, but the decision was to postpone a full implementation until a clear workflow is defined.  \n\n**Switchboard** \u2013 The Switchboard data were discussed mainly in the context of the transcription pipeline; the team noted that the Switchboard transcription status is largely on track and that IBM\u2019s tape was sent last week.  \n\n**Scheduling meetings** \u2013 Professor\u202fB expressed a preference for alternating meeting focus (e.g., demo\u2011centric one week, data\u2011processing one week) and suggested that future meetings be scheduled \u201cevery other week\u201d or \u201calternating focus\u201d to keep the agenda manageable.  He also recommended that the next meeting include a brief \u201cbullet\u2011point list\u201d of accomplishments to aid in the annual report.  Overall, the professor favored a flexible schedule that balances demo preparation with ongoing data processing.",
    "During the scrutiny session the committee pressed Deputy Minister Julie\u202fMorgan on the decision to abandon the HMRC\u2011based delivery of the childcare offer.  The committee\u2019s main concerns centred on the Welsh\u2011language requirements, the cost of the HMRC proposal and the flexibility needed to expand the offer to education, training and \u201con the cusp of work\u201d families.\n\nJulie explained that the HMRC option, while technically capable of handling a bilingual service, ran into serious practical problems.  The Welsh language standards required handling of special characters and integration with multiple IT systems (Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, Post Office), which HMRC\u2019s existing systems could not accommodate without significant redesign.  Moreover, the HMRC proposal was estimated to cost \u00a32.5\u202fmillion more than a locally\u2011administered system and would divert investment away from Wales, as the payment infrastructure would be run by an external agency.  The minister stressed that the decision was a principle one: the government wanted a flexible, locally\u2011driven system that could be expanded to include training and education, and that could be tailored to the unique Welsh context.  She noted that the local\u2011authority model would keep the money in Wales and allow closer engagement with families, while still providing a single application process.\n\nIn short, the committee\u2019s concerns about cost, language compatibility and flexibility were acknowledged, and Julie\u2019s position was that moving away from HMRC was the only viable route to a flexible, cost\u2011effective, and Welsh\u2011specific childcare offer.",
    "The professor opened the meeting by noting that the workshop we ran last month had been a useful learning exercise and suggested that we hold another workshop soon to review the new form and the belief\u2011net design.  He then turned to the team\u2019s feedback on the person in Grenada \u2013 Jose\u202fCarlos\u202fSegura \u2013 and said that the team had found him to be a solid collaborator with good technical skill and a helpful presence in the group.  \n\nWhen discussing the new data\u2011collection form, the professor listed the required fields: name, email, time (first), date, native language and region.  He also emphasized that \u201ctime comes first, then date\u201d and that the region field should be kept broad (e.g., North/West/Other) rather than overly granular.  \n\nFor the belief\u2011net, the professor suggested a three\u2011layer structure: (1) observed acoustic and lexical features (energy, pitch, \u201cnice walls\u201d, \u201cadmission fee\u201d, etc.), (2) a hidden middle layer of higher\u2011level concepts such as tourist, business, hurry, and (3) an output node that predicts the user\u2019s mode (Enter, Vista, Tango).  He stressed that the hidden layer should capture the semantic context before feeding into the final decision node.  \n\nGrad\u202fB, however, expressed a preference for a simpler architecture.  He argued that the current multi\u2011layer design was too complex and that a more streamlined structure would be easier to train and maintain, and that the hidden layer could be reduced or merged with the observed features.  In short, Grad\u202fB favored a leaner belief\u2011net that still captures the key decision variables but with fewer intermediate nodes.",
    "Grad\u202fE\u2019s experiment was aimed at refining the mean\u2011subtraction (spectral\u2011subtraction) stage of the SmartKom system.  He compared a \u201cpast\u2011only\u201d mean estimate (using the twelve\u202fseconds immediately preceding a frame) against the conventional centered\u2011window approach.  The result was a slight performance drop \u2013 the word\u2011error\u2011rate increased only marginally \u2013 but the method was still \u201cencouraging.\u201d  He also tested a range of window lengths (2\u202fs,\u202f4\u202fs,\u202f6\u202fs,\u202f12\u202fs) for training and found that training with a longer window did not translate into a big gain when the test window was shorter; the degradation was less than 0.5\u202f% and at most a 0.8\u202f% rise.  Overall, Grad\u202fE viewed the experiments as a useful sanity check that the simpler, past\u2011only mean subtraction was viable, though not a game\u2011changer, and he was ready to move on to more sophisticated noise\u2011compensation ideas.\n\nGrad\u202fA\u2019s project focused on the potential of \u201ccheating\u201d voicing information in a hybrid phone\u2011recognition system.  His goal was to see how much knowing exactly which segments are voiced (and setting non\u2011voiced phone probabilities to zero) could improve recognition accuracy.  He planned to run a series of experiments on TIMIT (and later digits or full words) to measure the relative benefit of this perfect voicing knowledge, with the expectation of completing the work by July.  Grad\u202fA\u2019s opinion was optimistic: he believed the experiments would demonstrate a clear advantage for phone\u2011level recognition and could be extended to higher\u2011level tasks, thereby validating the hypothesis that voicing cues are highly informative for acoustic\u2011model inference.",
    "The User Interface (UI) team pushed for a **minimal\u2011button, user\u2011friendly remote** that would appeal to a broad audience, especially younger users who value trendiness. Their key design proposals were:\n\n* **Shape & look** \u2013 Two fruit\u2011inspired concepts were floated: a banana\u2011shaped remote (soft, curved \u201cS\u201d profile) and a tomato\u2011shaped one. The banana shape was favored for its ergonomic curve and visual appeal, though the tomato was kept as a backup idea.  \n* **Button layout** \u2013 The UI argued for only the essential controls: *power*, *channel*, *volume*, and a single \u201cmenu\u201d button. All other functions would be hidden behind an LCD menu, reducing clutter and avoiding small, hard\u2011to\u2011press buttons.  \n* **Display & interaction** \u2013 An LCD screen would provide visual feedback and allow a simple scroll\u2011style menu. Speech\u2011recognition was considered a high\u2011value feature; the UI suggested a built\u2011in microphone and a simple \u201cvoice\u2011command\u201d button, but noted it could be dropped if cost constraints tightened.  \n* **Communication** \u2013 Radio\u2011frequency (RF) control was discussed, but the UI was concerned about potential interference with other home devices. They concluded that using the standard IR band (which is universally accepted and inexpensive) would sidestep any interference issues. If RF were chosen, the UI proposed a simple identification code or handshake to isolate each remote\u2019s signal.  \n* **Budget** \u2013 The team acknowledged an extra budget line but ultimately decided to keep costs low. They agreed that the IR option, minimal button set, and a modest LCD would stay well below the \u20ac14.60 per unit target, making the extra budget unnecessary.\n\n**Final decision**: adopt the banana\u2011shaped remote with a minimal button set (power, channel, volume, menu), an LCD screen, optional speech\u2011recognition, and IR transmission. No RF interference concerns will arise, and the extra budget will not be used. This design balances usability, trendiness, and cost efficiency.",
    "The professor emphasized that additive noise in the far\u2011microphone recordings is not simply reverberation but often low\u2011frequency interference (e.g., the 5\u202fHz hum from an air\u2011conditioner).  He noted that this type of noise does not dramatically distort the high\u2011frequency speech components, but it does introduce a slowly varying low\u2011frequency bias that can be removed with a mild high\u2011pass filter.  The suggested cutoff is around 20\u201330\u202fHz, with a gentle roll\u2011off that extends up to about 100\u202fHz; the effect on intelligible speech is minimal.\n\nTo mitigate such noise, the professor advocates a combination of smoothing, FIR filtering, and on\u2011line normalization.  FIR filters are used in two stages: a low\u2011pass filter for the low\u2011band (\u224864\u202fms delay) and a high\u2011pass filter for the high\u2011band (\u224811\u202fms delay).  These replace the older LDA filters and help preserve the spectral envelope while reducing the influence of the low\u2011frequency hum.  The professor also stresses that the quantization error (starting from 32\u2011bit to 16\u2011bit) is not a significant contributor to performance loss.\n\nFor additive noise itself, the group is exploring spectral subtraction combined with on\u2011line mean and variance normalization.  The spectral subtraction algorithm estimates the noise power spectrum during non\u2011speech segments (using a voice\u2011activity detector) and subtracts it from the noisy signal, after which the on\u2011line normalization smooths the resulting variance.  This two\u2011step process reduces the \u201cmusical noise\u201d that can arise from raw subtraction.  The professor also mentions that RASTA\u2011like filtering, applied in the log domain, helps to remove convolutional effects while leaving the speech envelope largely intact.  Overall, the strategy is to use a mild high\u2011pass FIR filter, smooth the residual noise with on\u2011line normalization, and apply spectral subtraction to address the additive component, all while keeping latency within the 200\u2013250\u202fms window acceptable for real\u2011time applications.",
    "During the session the team converged on a core set of functions for the new remote: power\u2011on/off, channel up/down, volume up/down, a menu button, and a minimal teletext option. The discussion then turned to two \u201cextra\u201d features that could set the product apart \u2013 a kinetic power source and a \u201croll\u2011through favorite channels\u201d capability.\n\n**Kinetic function**  \nSeveral voices floated the idea of a hand\u2011crank or solar\u2011powered remote to eliminate batteries. The concept was attractive for its eco\u2011friendly image, but the cost analysis and the added mechanical complexity quickly led the group to rule it out for the first release. A simple docking station for recharging was agreed upon as a compromise \u2013 it provides a clear visual cue that the remote is low on power and keeps the device lightweight.\n\n**Rolling through favourites**  \nThe team explored how to let users \u201croll\u201d through a pre\u2011set list of favourite channels. Three approaches were considered:  \n1. An LCD screen that displays the channel number and a small \u201cfavorites\u201d menu.  \n2. A scroll\u2011wheel or rotary encoder that can be turned to cycle through the list.  \n3. A mode\u2011switch button that toggles between normal channel surfing and a favourites list.  \n\nAfter weighing usability against cost, the consensus was to keep the interface simple: a single mode\u2011switch and a small LCD that shows the current channel number. The LCD would also display a tiny icon indicating when the remote is in favourites mode. The scroll\u2011wheel was deemed unnecessary for the target market and was dropped from the scope.\n\nIn short, the remote will focus on essential TV controls, a lightweight rechargeable dock, and a minimal LCD\u2011based favourites system, while kinetic power and a dedicated scroll wheel were set aside for future iterations.",
    "The team settled on a **demographic\u2011focused marketing strategy** that targets young, tech\u2011savvy consumers who value simplicity, durability, and a touch\u2011free experience.  Marketing outlined a plan that positions the remote as a \u201csmart\u2011home\u201d accessory rather than a high\u2011end gadget, emphasizing the **voice\u2011recognition** feature, a **solar\u2011powered backup** battery, and a **lifetime guarantee** to appeal to eco\u2011conscious buyers.  The pitch will highlight the remote\u2019s \u201cplug\u2011and\u2011play\u201d nature, its resistance to accidental button\u2011presses, and its modular case skins that can be swapped for a personal style.\n\nIndustrial Design agreed on a **neutral, modern appearance**: a single\u2011curved, rubber\u2011covered body in silver or grey, with a soft\u2011touch scroll wheel and rubber push\u2011buttons.  Both parties confirmed that the presentation will showcase a 3\u2011D mock\u2011up, a color palette sheet, and a short video of the remote in a living\u2011room setting.  Marketing will lead the PowerPoint deck, while the industrial designer will provide the visual mock\u2011ups; the two will co\u2011present to ensure the design language matches the brand narrative.\n\nThe Industrial Designer\u2019s marketing proposal frames the product as a \u201cnext\u2011generation remote\u201d that merges **functionality** (voice, basic TV control, channel lock) with **aesthetic flexibility** (multiple skin options, optional wooden or leather covers).  Marketing agrees that the most marketable aspect is the **combination of a user\u2011friendly interface, durable rubber case, and eco\u2011friendly power source**.  They concur that a touch\u2011screen, while attractive, would push the cost beyond the targeted \u20ac12\u201315 price point, so it will be deferred to a future model.  In short, the team has aligned on a simple, robust design that will resonate with the chosen demographic and will be presented cohesively across design and marketing materials.",
    "Grad\u202fG\u2019s remarks were largely supportive but also cautious.  When the group turned to the problem of **capturing the subject\u2019s intention**, he acknowledged that the key is to keep the system flexible enough to infer intent from a few utterances.  He said, \u201cWe need to give the wizard a way to ask follow\u2011up questions without forcing the subject into a rigid script,\u201d and the professor (Prof\u202fB) agreed, stressing that a good intention model is the linchpin for any dialogue system and that the current belief\u2011net prototype is a good starting point.  \n\nOn **MSG (Mel\u2011Spectral\u2011Gradient) features** Grad\u202fG was skeptical about their practical benefit, noting that the added complexity might not pay off in a real\u2011time setting.  Prof\u202fB, however, was enthusiastic, calling the MSG results \u201cgreat\u201d and encouraging the team to push the integration further, especially for the near\u2011microphone recordings where MSG\u2019s robustness to channel effects seemed promising.  \n\nWhen the team debated **pronouncing \u201czero\u201d versus \u201cO\u201d**, Grad\u202fG pointed out that the two words can be confused by speakers and that the system should treat them distinctly.  Prof\u202fB concurred, suggesting a separate label in the lexicon and noting that the current data\u2011collection protocol had been too permissive about the zero pronunciation.  \n\nFinally, on the matter of **hiring Fey** as the new wizard, Grad\u202fG expressed excitement, saying Fey\u2019s prior experience would \u201cmake the wizard work a lot smoother.\u201d  Prof\u202fB echoed this sentiment, labeling the hire as \u201cgreat\u201d and emphasizing that Fey\u2019s role in refining the dialogue flow would be critical for the next phase of experiments.",
    "The industrial designer\u2019s main stance on the children\u2019s remote was to keep the design **simple, robust, and cost\u2011effective** while still offering a touch of \u201cfancy\u201d appeal. He repeatedly stressed that the device should not be overloaded with buttons or functions, arguing that users (and especially children) only use a small fraction of the existing remote\u2019s controls. He favored a layout with a few large, user\u2011friendly buttons and suggested a child\u2011proof, waterproof build that could survive rough handling. The designer also entertained the idea of a rechargeable internal battery and a docking station as a potential selling point, but he cautioned that such features would add to the cost and complexity.\n\nRegarding **speech recognition**, the designer was intrigued by the concept, noting that it would \u201clook great\u201d and could be a differentiator for the target younger market. However, he was skeptical about fitting the necessary hardware and software into the tight \u20ac12\u201115 price target and the existing infrared\u2011only architecture. He explicitly said, \u201cI like the idea of speech recognition, but I\u2019m not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need to hit.\u201d\n\nOn **Bluetooth and other new technologies**, the designer was cautious. He pointed out that incorporating Bluetooth would require the TV to support it, which would raise the cost for the end user and complicate the design. He suggested that infrared should remain the primary transmission method and that any receiver or additional wireless capability would likely exceed the budget. In short, he welcomed new tech ideas but insisted they be evaluated against cost, simplicity, and the core requirement of a child\u2011friendly, affordable remote.",
    "The committee\u2019s debate on inspection priorities began with Jassa\u202fScott and Janet\u202fFinch\u2011Saunders agreeing that the next phase of inspections would be \u201cthematic\u201d and focused on curriculum reform.  They noted that the priority of inspections would shift from a purely \u201cby\u2011the\u2011book\u201d approach to one that aligns with the Welsh Government\u2019s broader agenda for school improvement, and that the cycle of inspections for regional consortia would be tightened and made more robust.\n\nThe reopening of the House of Commons was a separate issue that surfaced when the Chair asked whether Parliament would resume full\u2011power sittings under social\u2011distancing protocols.  Members raised the point that the reopening is not only a domestic procedural matter but also part of Canada\u2019s diplomatic posture, citing the government\u2019s recent statements on Hong\u202fKong and China and the need to maintain a clear stance on international relations while the House continues to operate in a hybrid format.\n\nWhen the committee moved to the allocation of funds and the fight against systemic racism, Justin\u202fTrudeau clarified that the federal government has a dedicated anti\u2011racism fund and that the allocation of this money is part of a broader \u201crevolution in national institutions.\u201d  He stressed that the fund is intended to support anti\u2011racism initiatives across the public sector, and that the government\u2019s strategy is to overhaul institutional practices to address racism more effectively, signalling a commitment to both financial support and structural reform.",
    "The team\u2019s discussion focused on creating a trendy, user\u2011friendly remote that balances technical feasibility with market appeal. **Technical and functional design**: The remote must control a TV and connected devices, use simple push\u2011button input (up, down, left, right, on/off), and be powered by a small battery with a side\u2011hatch for easy replacement. A \u201ckinetic\u201d or hand\u2011crank power option was mentioned as a novelty, but the final cost target remained below \u20ac12.50. **Prototype presentation**: Two concepts were showcased \u2013 a banana\u2011shaped, rubber\u2011cased unit and a flat, hard\u2011plastic \u201cscroll\u201d style. Both featured a single curve or double\u2011curve option for ergonomics, bright yellow with black buttons (company colours), and an optional waterproof shell. The prototypes were evaluated on comfort, button feel, and visual appeal. **Detailed design**: The group agreed on a single\u2011side push\u2011button layout, a removable cover for the battery and infrared emitter, and optional internal LED lighting. They debated a flip\u2011top or lock mechanism to prevent accidental presses, and the possibility of a multi\u2011device remote versus a dedicated TV remote. **Specific design requirements**: The remote must be lightweight, shock\u2011resistant, and optionally water\u2011proof. Buttons should be rubber\u2011capped for a spongy feel, with a minimalistic aesthetic that still feels \u201cfancy\u201d to the target market. The design must stay within the \u20ac12.50 production budget while offering enough novelty (fruit theme, interchangeable covers) to encourage repeat purchases. The team concluded that a simple, ergonomic remote with a fruit\u2011themed rubber shell and a clear button layout best meets the combined technical, functional, and market criteria.",
    "The team\u2019s meeting focused on turning a concept remote\u2011control into a manufacturable product while keeping cost, fun, and usability in balance.  \n**Process & Production Plan** \u2013 A spreadsheet of unit costs was reviewed, showing a target price of \u20ac12.50 and a projected profit of \u20ac50\u202fmillion.  The group debated battery choice (lithium vs. AAA), the inclusion of a voice\u2011recognition chip, and the number of buttons (top, sides, scroll\u2011wheel).  They agreed on a single\u2011curved, gun\u2011metal plastic body with a detachable, spongy rubber base that could be swapped for \u201cfruit\u201d skins (broccoli, strawberry, etc.).  The prototype was inspected for ergonomics, button placement, and \u201csquishiness\u201d before finalising the design.  \n**Work Division** \u2013 Roles were clearly delineated: the project manager led scheduling and budgeting; the industrial designer focused on form, material, and ergonomics; the UI designer handled button logic, touch\u2011pad placement, and voice integration; the marketing specialist mapped trend data, pricing, and launch strategy.  Each member worked independently on their segment and then convened to reconcile differences and adjust the cost model.  \n**Evaluation & Team Dynamics** \u2013 The group used a seven\u2011point scale to rate the prototype on ease of use, fashionability, technological innovation, and \u201cfruitiness.\u201d  Scores ranged from 2 to 4, indicating acceptable but improvable areas.  Participants noted strong creative freedom, effective leadership, and good collaboration, though they flagged some frustration with tool choices (e.g., PowerPoint, whiteboard).  Overall, the team concluded the design met the budget, satisfied user\u2011centric criteria, and was ready to move into final production planning.",
    "The group spent the first part of the meeting sketching **future directions** for the multilingual tandem system.  PhD\u202fD presented the architecture of the multilingual neural network, explaining that it was trained on a large, mixed\u2011language corpus (English, French, Spanish, Italian, TIMIT, and Aurora noise) and that the model\u2019s output was a 27\u2011class \u201cphonetic\u201d label set derived from SAMPA.  He noted that the network\u2019s performance dropped only modestly when the training data differed in language or task, but that the mismatch between training and test conditions still produced a 1.3\u2011fold increase in error over the baseline.  He suggested that the next step would be to experiment with more context\u2011dependent outputs and to explore alternative training targets (articulatory features or regression) to reduce language and noise dependency.\n\nDuring a side conversation, PhD\u202fC raised concerns with Professor\u202fB about the **multiple\u2011language strategy**.  Professor\u202fB emphasized that the current multilingual model already includes English, French, and Spanish, but that adding more languages would double the training set size without a corresponding increase in network capacity.  PhD\u202fC argued that a single\u2011language network trained on a broad, multi\u2011language corpus might generalize better, while Professor\u202fB countered that the data already contains enough diversity and that the real bottleneck is the limited number of output units rather than the number of languages.\n\nFinally, the group discussed **data release policies**.  Professor\u202fB outlined a plan to publish the meeting transcripts, but only after a review period in which participants could request deletions or edits.  The team agreed on a two\u2011week window for responses, with an explicit \u201cno changes\u201d option to avoid indefinite delays.  They also debated whether to allow participants to \u201ccut things out\u201d from the final transcripts, concluding that any edits must be documented and that the final release would be a single, tamper\u2011evident version.  The discussion concluded with a commitment to send the first batch of cleaned transcripts by the end of the month and to refine the consent process for future meetings.",
    "Ms.\u202fJenny\u202fKwan\u2019s remark about a \u201cgap between program development and its implementation\u201d is a critique of the lag that often exists between the creation of a policy and the day\u2011to\u2011day delivery of its benefits. In the context of the House debate, she was referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the broader family\u2011support framework that was designed to provide income replacement and spousal\u2011maintenance assistance to single parents.  \n\nDuring the committee\u2019s discussion, the Minister of Employment acknowledged that the issue had been on her radar for the past three weeks and that she was \u201clooking into it.\u201d However, Kwan pointed out that, despite this acknowledgement, no concrete action had yet been taken. The policy (the program\u2019s design and eligibility criteria) was in place, but the mechanisms to actually disburse funds or adjust the benefit thresholds were not functioning effectively. This disconnect meant that single parents\u2014who rely on spousal support and child maintenance to survive\u2014were not receiving the assistance they were supposed to receive.  \n\nKwan\u2019s statement therefore underscores a systemic problem: the time, resources, and administrative capacity required to translate a policy into practice can be underestimated. When the implementation phase lags behind, the intended beneficiaries experience real hardship, and the policy\u2019s goals are undermined. Her comment is a call for the government to accelerate the rollout, close administrative bottlenecks, and ensure that the support promised in policy documents reaches those who need it in a timely manner.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) viewed the last meeting review as a useful recap that highlighted the remote\u2019s core functions and cost constraints, but he felt it was still too high\u2011level and lacked concrete progress on the market research findings. He appreciated the market research data\u2014particularly the desire for a modern, simplified remote and the willingness of younger users to pay extra for voice\u2011recognition\u2014but was skeptical about the feasibility of incorporating all those features within the \u20ac25 target price. When reflecting on the presentations, the PM judged them as \u201cmostly on track\u201d but noted that the content was uneven: some slides were well\u2011structured and data\u2011rich, while others were vague or incomplete. He saw this as a sign that the team was still piecing together a coherent narrative rather than delivering a finished product.\n\nThe group\u2019s differing opinion stemmed from their emphasis on creative exploration and a broader interpretation of the research. While the PM focused on budget, feasibility, and a single\u2011purpose remote, the team members leaned toward a more ambitious, feature\u2011rich design that included voice\u2011recognition, a solar cell, and a tracking device. Their enthusiasm for \u201cgimmick\u201d features and a stylized look (e.g., a panther drawing) reflected a desire to differentiate the product in a crowded market, whereas the PM prioritized practicality and cost control.\n\nRegarding the panther drawing, the PM saw it as an interesting but potentially risky visual choice. He acknowledged that a panther could convey power and sleekness, yet he questioned whether it would resonate with the target demographic and fit the brand\u2019s modern aesthetic. The group, however, viewed the panther as a bold, memorable icon that could set the remote apart, even if it required extra effort to render convincingly on a small surface.",
    "The team\u2019s consensus was that the remote must balance **simplicity, usability and \u201cwow\u201d factor**.  \n\n**Buttons for multiple operations** \u2013 Everyone agreed that the core functions (power, volume, channel up/down, number pad) should be on tactile push\u2011buttons that are large enough for older users and have distinct shapes or colors to aid recognition. They also discussed a \u201cmulti\u2011mode\u201d approach: a single button could perform different actions in different contexts, but the risk of confusion was noted, so the design leaned toward a minimal set of dedicated buttons with clear icons.  \n\n**LCD screen** \u2013 The LCD was seen as a key differentiator. It would provide real\u2011time feedback (current channel, volume, on\u2011screen menu) and allow a smaller physical keypad. The team decided the LCD should be placed on the front of the remote, protected by a clear or frosted cover, and that a spinning wheel or touch\u2011pad could be used inside the screen area for menu navigation.  \n\n**Microphone position** \u2013 Voice\u2011recognition was a top trend, so the microphone was to be placed near the bottom of the remote, close to the user\u2019s mouth when holding it, but still protected by a rubber or silicone cover to avoid accidental activation and to keep the remote lightweight.  \n\n**Push\u2011buttons** \u2013 Push\u2011buttons remained essential for the most frequent operations. The team wanted a **curved, one\u2011side\u2011rounded case** (to fit the right hand) with a rubber exterior for durability and a \u201cfind\u2011my\u2011remote\u201d glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark feature. The push\u2011buttons would be integrated into the outer shell, while the interior would house the LCD, speaker, microphone and power supply.  \n\nOverall, the remote was to be a hybrid: a classic button\u2011based interface for quick, tactile use, supplemented by an LCD for advanced features and a built\u2011in microphone for voice control, all wrapped in a curved, rubber\u2011covered, single\u2011side\u2011curved case that meets the key concepts of usability, innovation and brand identity.",
    "The pandemic turned Canada\u2019s tourism sector into a \u201cfirst\u2011hit\u201d industry.  With provincial and international borders shut, travel bans and mandatory lockdowns, hotels, restaurants, cruise ships and small\u2011scale rural operators saw revenue collapse and many were forced to suspend operations.  Seasonal businesses\u2014particularly in Atlantic Canada, the Maritimes, and remote communities\u2014were hit hardest, and the loss of cruise\u2011ship passengers left a sizeable gap in the tourism\u2011related economy.  The industry also faced uncertainty over when and how it could safely reopen, as well as a lack of clear criteria for border re\u2011entry and health\u2011safety requirements.\n\nIn response, the federal government rolled out a package of targeted measures to cushion the blow and lay the groundwork for a recovery.  In June 2020, the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Heritage announced a $70\u202fmillion investment to offset losses across the sector, with $30\u202fmillion earmarked for Atlantic Canada, $7\u202fmillion for northern regions and $3.5\u202fmillion for the west.  The package also included a $1\u202fbillion boost to support destination marketing, tourism associations and small businesses through the Canada Emergency Business Account and commercial\u2011rent assistance.  The government further launched Canada Tourism Week 2020 to raise awareness and stimulate demand, and committed to clear, science\u2011based criteria for border reopening and health\u2011safety protocols to give operators a \u201cnew normal\u201d framework.  These measures were designed to preserve jobs, keep tourism infrastructure operational and accelerate the sector\u2019s return to pre\u2011pandemic activity levels.",
    "**Presentation & Design Direction**  \nThe team opened by outlining a vision for a \u201chigh\u2011tech, fashion\u2011forward\u201d TV remote that would appeal to younger consumers while remaining user\u2011friendly for all ages. The core concept is a minimalist form factor with a mouse\u2011shaped body, a single scroll\u2011wheel for volume, two channel\u2011change buttons, a power button, and a menu button for occasional advanced functions. The design emphasizes a sleek, ergonomic grip, interchangeable covers, and a prominent corporate logo.\n\n**Energy Source**  \nAfter weighing options, the group agreed on a long\u2011life sealed battery that would last 5\u201310\u202fyears. This \u201clifetime\u201d battery would be guaranteed, with a replacement policy that encourages users to buy new covers rather than a whole new remote, turning the device into a fashion accessory that can be refreshed annually.\n\n**Components & Functional Design**  \n- **Chip**: A custom\u2011designed integrated circuit to support voice recognition and the limited button set. Custom design was chosen for flexibility, despite higher cost and longer lead time.  \n- **Power**: Sealed battery, no external charging.  \n- **Infra\u2011red Transmitter**: Standard IR module driven by the chip.  \n- **Voice Recognition**: Included as a core feature, allowing spoken channel numbers and simple commands.  \n- **User Interface**: Minimal buttons, a scroll wheel, and a single menu button. The remote will not display a screen; all advanced settings appear on the TV.\n\n**Prototype & Decision**  \nA quick prototype was sketched using plasticine, showing the ergonomic shape, button layout, and cover slots. The team reached consensus that the design meets the brief: a stylish, low\u2011button remote with long\u2011life battery, custom chip, and voice capability. The next steps involve detailed component sourcing, final CAD modeling, and production cost verification against the \u20ac12.50 budget. The prototype will be reviewed in the next meeting to confirm manufacturability and user acceptance.",
    "The team agreed that the mid\u2011July DARPA meeting is a hard deadline that forces them to finish the transcription pipeline and the \u201cmock\u2011up\u201d QA interface before the conference.  The decision was to push all remaining work\u2014finalizing the beep\u2011based segmentation, cleaning up the IBM transcription workflow, and ensuring the transcribers have a stable, near\u2011production environment\u2014so that the DARPA group can present a ready\u2011to\u2011use system.\n\nThe paper they are preparing is structured around three inter\u2011related experiments:\n\n1. **Quantifying overlap** \u2013 The authors measured how much speech overlaps in several corpora.  They defined a \u201cspurt\u201d as a continuous stretch of speech with no pause longer than 500\u202fms and counted overlapped spurts and overlapped words.  Results show that the Meeting\u2011Recorder meetings have the highest overlap (\u224817\u201318\u202f% of words), the Robustness meetings the lowest (\u22488\u20139\u202f%), while Switchboard and CallHome fall in the middle (\u224814\u201315\u202f% of words).  Two\u2011party telephone data show a similar overlap level to the face\u2011to\u2011face meetings.\n\n2. **Overlap and recognition error** \u2013 Using the same data, the authors scored recognition only on the foreground\u2011speech segments identified by their automatic segmentation.  After excluding overlapped regions, the word\u2011error rate dropped to almost the baseline level seen on non\u2011overlapped speech, confirming that most extra errors are due to insertions caused by background speech.\n\n3. **Interrupt analysis** \u2013 The paper examines where speakers tend to be interrupted, conditioning on the preceding discourse marker.  The authors found that the probability of an interrupt is substantially higher after back\u2011channels, discourse markers, or filled pauses than before a pause or at a sentence boundary.\n\nThese statistics\u2014overlap percentages, error\u2011rate reductions, and interrupt probabilities\u2014constitute the quantitative backbone of the paper and provide the evidence needed to convince DARPA that the system is ready for deployment.",
    "The group settled on using the **digits corpus** as a small, controlled testbed for the larger Aurora\u2011style experiments.  The plan was to **train a baseline HTK recognizer** on the digits data collected in the meeting room with close\u2011talk lapel microphones, then **test it on the same recordings** and on the **TI\u2011digits** database to gauge mismatch effects.  They also discussed using the **SRI tandem system** (trained on a large multilingual corpus) as a comparison point.  \n\nThe **current technique** is a simple HTK pipeline: acoustic models trained on the digits, forced\u2011alignment for word\u2011level timing, and a small amount of speaker\u2011adaptation (mean/variance and VTLN).  The main **limitations** identified were: (1) the HTK models were trained on a very limited amount of data, so adaptation yields only a few\u2011percent improvement; (2) the digits recorded in the room are noisier and more reverberant than the clean TI\u2011digits, leading to a large mismatch; and (3) the baseline models do not exploit the richer front\u2011end features (PLP, JRASTA, MSG) that could be fed into the recognizer.  \n\n**Progress**: The group has produced preliminary word\u2011error rates for the baseline HTK system (\u224830\u201340\u202f% on the close\u2011talk recordings) and has shown that a modest 1\u20132\u202f% gain can be obtained with speaker\u2011adaptation.  They have also run the SRI tandem system on the same data, confirming that it outperforms the HTK baseline but still suffers from the mismatch.  Experiments with different feature streams and adaptation strategies are underway.  \n\n**Delays**: Scheduling has been a recurring issue\u2014most participants can only meet on Saturdays due to conflicting commitments, and some have limited access to the required hardware (e.g., head\u2011mounted microphones, Linux machines).  Additionally, the team must wait for the SRI system to be released and for the TI\u2011digits results to be available, which has pushed back the timeline for a definitive evaluation.  Resource constraints (CPU, disk, and the need to port code to the new IBM machine) also add to the delay.",
    "**Triple\u202fR vs. Triple\u202fRC**  \nDuring the naming debate the team agreed that \u201cTriple\u202fR\u201d was clearer and less redundant. \u201cRC\u201d is the abbreviation for \u201cremote control,\u201d so \u201cTriple\u202fRC\u201d reads as \u201cTriple\u202fRemote Control,\u201d which feels tautological and heavy. \u201cTriple\u202fR\u201d can be interpreted as \u201cTriple\u2011Remote\u201d or simply \u201cTriple\u201d with a single R, making the brand name shorter, easier to pronounce, and less likely to be mistaken for a product with three separate remotes.\n\n**Target age group**  \nThe consensus was to focus on the 15\u201135\u2011year\u2011old bracket. This cohort is identified as early adopters, comfortable with new tech, and willing to pay a premium for stylish, high\u2011tech features such as voice recognition. Market research showed that 25\u201135\u2011year\u2011olds were the most enthusiastic about voice controls, while older users were less inclined to embrace the technology. The group also represents a segment with disposable income and a desire for \u201cfashionable electronics,\u201d aligning with the company\u2019s brand promise.\n\n**Why the marketing team chose young people**  \nMarketing argued that young consumers are the most likely to adopt a new remote\u2011control concept, appreciate a sleek design, and value the convenience of voice commands. They also noted that this demographic is more receptive to \u201csmart\u201d features and is willing to purchase an extra remote rather than rely on the one that comes with a TV. Targeting this group therefore maximizes the product\u2019s appeal and potential sales volume.\n\n**Channel\u2011selection discussion**  \nThe team debated whether to provide a full channel list or a simplified interface. Consensus settled on keeping channel selection basic: a small set of frequently used channels plus a numeric entry for less common ones. They rejected the inclusion of teletext, deeming it outdated, and decided that the LCD would simply display the current channel and basic controls. The goal was to keep the remote intuitive while still offering a modest level of advanced functionality.",
    "The team began by reviewing market research that highlighted a strong desire for a \u201cfancy\u201d look\u2011and\u2011feel over purely functional remotes. A 100\u2011person study showed 80\u202f% of respondents would pay more for a remote that looked stylish, with fruit\u2011and\u2011vegetable themes and a spongy, rubberised surface emerging as the top trend. The research also revealed that users only use about 10\u202f% of the buttons on current remotes, indicating a need to reduce clutter and simplify the interface.\n\nDesigners debated the core feature set. The consensus was to keep the essential controls\u2014channel, volume, power\u2014and to add a programmable \u201cmacro\u201d button that could launch a TV, VCR, or DVD in one press. A flip\u2011top shell was proposed to hide a small LCD display or touch pad for menu navigation, while the lower half would contain tactile rubberised buttons. The idea of a two\u2011piece system (a base unit and a handheld) was floated but largely abandoned in favour of a single, compact design that could be charged via a standard battery or, if cost allows, a kinetic or solar charging module.\n\nThe necessity of a revolution in remote\u2011control interaction was underscored by the discussion of voice\u2011recognition, location\u2011finding beeps, and a scroll\u2011wheel interface inspired by the iPod. While voice recognition was seen as a potential differentiator, its cost and complexity made it a risky addition for a 12\u2011\u20ac target price. Instead, the group leaned toward a minimalistic, user\u2011friendly interface that could be quickly learned, supported by a small LCD for menu access, and a sleek, ergonomic shape that could be customized with removable rubber skins in various colors.\n\nOverall, the group agreed that a successful product would marry a fashionable, tactile body with a streamlined button layout, a simple macro function, and optional smart features, all within a tight budget and a clear target of 4\u202fmillion units.",
    "Kirsty\u202fWilliams AM set out a clear, outcome\u2011driven framework for quality assurance in higher education.  She explained that the new PCET Bill will replace the 2015 Act with a commission that can set **outcome agreements** for institutions, allowing the Welsh Government to link public funding to national priorities while preserving institutional autonomy.  The commission will be empowered to use a range of soft and hard regulatory powers \u2013 from advice and monitoring to sanctions \u2013 so that the sector can respond quickly to quality or financial breaches.  She emphasised that the remit letter remains a key lever for setting national priorities and that the new legislation will build on the experience of the 2015 Act to strengthen collaboration across the sector.\n\nBethan\u202fOwen highlighted that, while the sector is experiencing financial strain, the proportion of universities in the high\u2011risk category is not increasing dramatically.  She noted that institutions are managing deficits through careful forecasting and that the risk profile may rise if the current trend of borrowing and pension costs continues, but she stressed that no collapse is expected in the near term.\n\nThe five principles Williams outlined for the reopening of schools during the pandemic were: (1) safeguarding the physical and emotional well\u2011being of pupils and staff; (2) positioning decisions within the wider Welsh Government response; (3) clear, evidence\u2011based communication to parents and staff; (4) building confidence among stakeholders; and (5) operationalising safe, phased returns through detailed planning.\n\nOn new examinations and school qualifications, Williams explained that the government will rely on a modified, outcome\u2011based grading system.  Teachers will submit grade judgements for students who missed exams, which will be moderated nationally to ensure fairness, and the system will be designed to account for the impact of COVID\u2011related learning loss.\n\nWhen questioned about doubts that the government\u2019s actions were insufficient, Williams responded that the remit letter, the new commission\u2019s powers, and ongoing monitoring give her confidence that the sector is being steered effectively.  She acknowledged that no system is perfect but stressed that the Welsh Government will continue to assess and adjust its approach as the situation evolves.",
    "The team\u2019s review of the production process revealed a mix of enthusiasm and frustration. **Likes** centered on the freedom to shape the product\u2019s look and feel. Everyone praised the ability to choose a sleek gunmetal\u2011gray finish, a curving, finger\u2011friendly chassis, and a \u201ccookie\u2011like\u201d aesthetic that felt fresh and trendy. The group enjoyed the wireless prototype, the use of digital pens, and the shared network that let designers, engineers and marketers collaborate in real time. They were pleased that the project stayed within the \u20ac12.50 budget and that the lithium battery decision kept the device technologically advanced. Team members also highlighted the fun of the prototype build, the supportive teamwork, and the overall sense that the remote could \u201csell millions\u201d if it hit the market.\n\n**Dislikes** emerged mainly from the prototype\u2019s shortcomings and the initial scope constraints. The materials didn\u2019t match expectations, and the prototype\u2019s buttons lit all at once instead of individually, undermining usability. The curvature that worked in design sketches was hard to replicate, and the cherry\u2011fruit cover proved difficult to integrate. The remote\u2019s strict focus on TV functionality left some team members questioning its market relevance. Ratings on the evaluation criteria were low for fashionability, \u201cfeel good\u201d ergonomics, and technological innovation, partly because the prototype lacked a voice\u2011recognition feature and a clear reflection of its intended tech. Some frustration was voiced about the survey process and the digital pens\u2019 limited usefulness. Overall, while the team enjoyed the creative control and collaborative atmosphere, they were disappointed by prototype limitations and felt the final product could have been more versatile and polished.",
    "**Mean\u2011subtraction in the SRI experiments**\n\nThe group spent a significant portion of the meeting dissecting the role of mean subtraction (or \u201cmean\u2011shift\u201d normalization) in the SRI recognizer, especially in comparison with the Aurora/HTK baseline.  Grad\u202fE first observed that after re\u2011synthesizing PZM recordings, mean subtraction appeared to make the signals \u201clouder.\u201d  He suggested it might simply be a gain\u2011control effect that improves signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio, but Professor\u202fB pointed out that any uniform scaling applied during both training and testing would not affect recognition accuracy because the absolute level is ignored by the models.\n\nThe discussion then turned to the specific implementation used in the SRI system.  Professor\u202fB explained that the system performs a channel\u2011adaptation step that involves subtracting the mean of the FFT spectrum (without a log) and then removing that mean phase from each frame.  This differs from the more common approach of subtracting the mean log spectrum, which Grad\u202fE noted could be mathematically problematic because of phase wrapping.  Professor\u202fB also mentioned that the SRI system\u2019s finer\u2011grained acoustic models are more sensitive to artifacts introduced by re\u2011synthesis (e.g., echo), so mean subtraction may help normalise channel differences but could also exacerbate such artifacts if not handled carefully.\n\nFinally, the group noted that mean subtraction can be viewed as a form of DC\u2011offset or gain compensation.  Professor\u202fB warned that while the operation itself is simple, its interaction with other front\u2011end steps (VAD, spectral subtraction, VTS) can significantly influence overall performance.  The consensus was that mean subtraction should be applied consistently across training and test data, and its effect should be evaluated in the context of the full pipeline rather than in isolation.",
    "The group spent a large portion of the meeting debating how to handle the **mixed\u2011signal** problem that arises when the far\u2011field microphone picks up a blend of the target speaker and background chatter.  They noted that reverberation and the presence of a video projector in the room had pushed the signal\u2011to\u2011noise ratio down to only about 9\u202fdB, so the team explored how a better **VAD** could clean up the signal before it reached the recognizer.  The discussion moved from the classic spectral\u2011subtraction + LDA\u2011based VAD to a newer neural\u2011network VAD that uses 9\u2011frame context, MFCCs after noise compensation, and a two\u2011stage delta calculation.  Although the new VAD added some latency (\u2248220\u202fms, potentially reducible to \u2248170\u202fms with a different delta strategy), the team agreed that the **VAD results** were promising: a roughly 60\u202f% error\u2011rate drop on the well\u2011matched Aurora data, and a 62\u202f% improvement when compared with the \u201cIDL\u201d VAD baseline.  The VAD also helped the system to ignore background speech, reducing insertions in the highly mismatched case.\n\nPostdoc\u202fA was asked about the new headphones that had been supplied for transcription.  He confirmed that the new models were far more comfortable than the old ones, had better signal\u2011to\u2011noise, and would reduce the need for post\u2011processing edits.\n\nOn the **data\u2011space** front, the team discussed moving the bulk of the Meeting\u2011Recorder recordings off the current 1\u2011TB drive.  They planned to copy the data to the Broadcast\u2011News archive and, where possible, use compressed (down\u2011sampled) versions to save space.  A short\u2011term alternative would be to archive the raw waveforms on a new 2\u2011TB external drive until the network storage is re\u2011configured.\n\nFinally, the group set several deadlines.  The Eurospeech submission is due **15\u202fNovember**; the evaluation report is due **15\u202fNovember** as well.  The consent\u2011form deadline for the participants is **15\u202fJuly**.  For the meeting\u2011recording project, the next meeting is scheduled for **17\u202fSeptember**, with a follow\u2011up on **23\u202fSeptember** to review progress, and a final review on **30\u202fSeptember** before the end of the fiscal quarter.",
    "Special schools are treated as part of the \u201cnew purpose\u201d framework in the same way as mainstream schools \u2013 they are expected to remain in their existing premises and continue to provide education to the children who attend them, subject to the same health\u2011and\u2011safety guidance that applies across the sector.  Head\u2011teachers retain the discretion to close or restrict access if a risk assessment requires it, but the policy is that special schools should not be moved into other settings; they will keep their children in the same schools that they normally occupy, with the same social\u2011distancing and hygiene measures that have been applied elsewhere.\n\nWhen it comes to the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for looked\u2011after children, special schools are part of the same coordinated scheme that the regional consortia oversee.  The consortia are responsible for the strategic deployment of the PDG, for monitoring how the money is spent, and for ensuring that the support reaches the children who need it.  Special schools receive the same PDG funding as other schools, but the consortia work with them to identify individual looked\u2011after pupils, to ensure that the grant is used for evidence\u2011based interventions, and to track outcomes.  Thus, special schools continue to serve their vulnerable learners, including looked\u2011after children, while the regional consortia provide the overarching framework and oversight for PDG allocation and impact assessment.",
    "The prototype was unveiled by the **User\u2011Interface (UI) designer** first, who handed the model to the group and highlighted its ergonomics: a hand\u2011shaped body that \u201cmoulds to the shape of your hand\u201d with a scroll wheel on the left for volume and two channel\u2011up/down buttons on the right. The UI emphasized the prominent power button, the infrared (IR) emitter, and the soft, rubbery cover that would be interchangeable. The **Industrial Designer (ID)** added detail on the physical layout\u2014holes for the buttons, the \u201cred cover\u201d that slides over the entire case, and the suggestion of a lightweight plastic shell with a rubbery outer layer for comfort and strain\u2011reduction. The **Project Manager (PM)** focused on the functional aspects: the IR section, the power key, and the overall \u201cfashionable\u201d look, noting that the prototype\u2019s shape would allow it to stand upright on a base.\n\nDuring the discussion on universality, the team debated the technical and cost implications. The PM raised the need for a chip that could handle multiple IR codes, while the ID pointed out that adding a universal mode would increase complexity. They weighed using a simple chip for basic functions versus a regular chip for a scroll wheel or an advanced chip for a display. The idea of an \u201cuniversal remote\u201d was also linked to the possibility of interchangeable covers that could accommodate different language layouts. The group concluded that while a fully universal remote would broaden market appeal, it would require extra buttons, a more sophisticated chip, and higher material costs, so they kept the prototype focused on core functions and left the universal feature as a future enhancement.",
    "The industrial designer\u2019s remarks were focused on making the remote look \u201cfancy\u201d yet functional, on the physical shape of the controller, and on how the design would resonate with the target customers.\n\n**Appearance**  \n- The case should be a single\u2011curved, blue plastic shell with a \u201cspongy\u201d feel; the buttons are soft rubber with bright yellow colour accents.  \n- A fluorescent\u2011green LED is used for the menu button and the remote is overall bright and eye\u2011catching.  \n- The designer suggested a biomorphic, fruit\u2011or\u2011vegetable style for the exterior (e.g., a lemon\u2011shaped button) to appeal to younger, trend\u2011aware buyers.  \n- All buttons are raised and use universal symbols (no text) so the remote is instantly recognisable in any language.\n\n**Structure**  \n- The remote is built around a simple chip\u2011on\u2011board architecture, with a rechargeable battery and a detachable speech\u2011recognition module.  \n- The design favours push\u2011buttons over scroll wheels, keeping the interface minimalistic.  \n- The case material is chosen to be strong yet recyclable; a plastic shell is preferred over titanium to keep costs within budget.  \n- The ergonomic shape is a single curve that fits comfortably in the hand and allows all controls to be reached with one thumb.\n\n**Customer preferences**  \n- Younger consumers want a colourful, playful look and a \u201csnail\u201d or fruit theme; older users need large, easy\u2011to\u2011press buttons and clear icons.  \n- Parents value a speech\u2011recognition feature that helps locate a lost remote.  \n- The remote must be inexpensive enough to sell under \u20ac12.50, yet still convey a premium feel through colour and texture.  \n- Modularity was discussed \u2013 optional modules for parental control or extra functions \u2013 but the designer noted that a single, well\u2011designed unit would likely be more appealing and easier to market.",
    "The House\u2019s committee record shows that the federal government earmarked **$75\u202fmillion** to support the national strategy on sexual exploitation and human trafficking.  The money was intended for frontline service providers\u2014shelters, counselling and legal assistance\u2014yet many organisations reported that the funds had not yet reached their doors.  The government has stated that the $75\u202fmillion will be disbursed in phases, with a first tranche announced in early May and subsequent allocations tied to the launch of a \u201cnew pillar of empowerment\u201d in the strategy.  The plan also calls for a coordinated \u201chub\u2011and\u2011spoke\u201d model to ensure rapid access to services for survivors, and the Minister of Women and Gender Equality has said the government will monitor uptake and adjust the distribution as needed.\n\nIn the same session, the notion of **risk appetite** surfaced in discussions about how the government balances fiscal risk, regulatory risk and public\u2011health risk.  Ministers were asked to explain how they set the level of risk they are willing to accept in programs such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Recovery Benefit, and how that appetite is reflected in the design of new support mechanisms.  The committee noted that a clear risk\u2011management framework is essential to avoid over\u2011exposure while still delivering timely assistance.\n\nRegarding **systemic racism**, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs **Chrystia\u202fFreeland** reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to confronting racism in Canada.  She highlighted the launch of a national anti\u2011racism strategy, the allocation of $6.2\u202fmillion to Statistics Canada for race\u2011based data collection, and the pledge to review mandatory minimum penalties and invest in restorative justice.  Freeland underscored that systemic racism is a public\u2011policy issue that must be addressed through data, accountability and reforms across policing, the justice system and social services.",
    "The segmenter is now fully integrated into the production pipeline and is being used to replace the hand\u2011segmented ground truth that had been feeding the recognizer.  Thilo\u2019s automatic segmenter has been tuned for high recall, even at the expense of precision, so that it over\u2011generates boundaries but still captures most utterance onsets and offsets.  Recent experiments show that when the recognizer is fed these automatic boundaries it performs almost as well as with the hand\u2011segmented data, and the extra noise from the over\u2011generation can be mitigated by retraining the noise models on the resulting transients.\n\nA key change this week was the addition of a \u201cbeep\u2011digit\u2011beep\u201d marker in the audio to aid the segmenter.  Adam generated a short script that splices recorded digits (1\u201310) between beeps, giving the segmenter a clear cue for each utterance.  The team also added a new step in the directory\u2011reorganization workflow to record the exact timestamps of each segment, so that any future edits can be traced back to the original automatic boundaries.\n\nThe segmenter\u2019s output is now being logged in a spreadsheet that tracks start times, speaker counts, and transcription status.  This spreadsheet is exported to HTML and will be posted on the Meeting Recorder web page, giving stakeholders a live view of which meetings have been automatically segmented and which still need manual review.\n\nOverall, the segmenter is stable, fully automated, and is now the default for the DARPA July meeting.  The only remaining work is to fine\u2011tune the VTLN\u2011normalised front\u2011end and to verify that the over\u2011generation does not introduce unacceptable insertion errors in the final recognizer output.",
    "During the interactive evaluation the User\u2011Interface (UI) designer pushed the price higher because the prototype had a full LCD display, a voice\u2011recognition microphone, a scroll wheel and a rubber\u2011covered body \u2013 all features that satisfied the user\u2011requirements for accessibility and \u201cfancy\u201d appeal but added to the bill of materials. The Industrial Designer (ID) argued that the core functionality could be achieved with a simple push\u2011button set on a hard\u2011plastic shell, keeping the unit within the \u20ac12.50 budget that the finance team had set. The UI therefore saw the price as a barrier to meeting the hot\u2011trend demand for a technologically innovative, visually striking remote, whereas the ID viewed cost as the primary constraint.\n\nAfter the product evaluation the UI objected to a redesign because the team had already invested time and money in the current form and the redesign would delay launch and inflate costs. The UI felt that the prototype already met the minimal user\u2011requirements and that the evaluation\u2019s feedback could be addressed through fine\u2011tuning rather than a wholesale redesign.\n\nThe UI\u2019s choice of yellow and red reflected both brand identity and usability. Yellow, the company\u2019s corporate colour, offers high visibility for older users, while red accents provide a contemporary, fruit\u2011inspired aesthetic that aligns with the market trend toward bright, playful designs. The ID and marketing preferred a more neutral colour palette, fearing that too bright a scheme would drive up paint costs and risk alienating conservative buyers.\n\nFinally, marketing disagreed with the UI\u2019s banana\u2011shaped, highly ergonomic form because it was perceived as too niche and potentially more expensive to manufacture. Marketing argued for a simpler, more conventional shape that could be mass\u2011produced at lower cost and would appeal to a broader consumer base while still allowing for optional \u201cfruit\u2011style\u201d skins to satisfy the trend.",
    "Kay\u202fMartin (Cardiff and\u202fVale College) sees the Welsh baccalaureate as a useful, but not universal, tool for employability. She argues that it helps some learners\u2014especially those on A\u2011level or vocational routes\u2014to build literacy, numeracy and digital skills, but it can be too burdensome for those already juggling resits or multiple qualifications. Martin stresses that other programmes (e.g., Career\u202fReady, BTEC pathways, WorldSkills) often deliver more tangible industry experience and that the bac should be contextualised rather than treated as a blanket requirement.\n\nDafydd\u202fEvans (ColegauCymru) is more critical. He contends that employers, parents and learners largely do not understand the bac\u2019s content or value, citing its confusing title and the \u201cpaper\u2011based\u201d nature of the assessment. Evans believes the qualification has drifted from its original vision of developing employability and entrepreneurial skills, becoming a bureaucratic exercise that adds little real skill to the learner\u2019s portfolio. He calls for a review that gives employers a stronger voice and a clearer, more focused curriculum.\n\nNick\u202fBrazil (Gower College Swansea) echoes Evans\u2019 concerns but focuses on the mismatch between the bac\u2019s demands and the skills employers need. He notes that the qualification\u2019s \u201crigorous, demanding\u201d structure can overwhelm students, especially those resitting GCSEs, and that many employers do not recognise the bac as a valid indicator of employable skills. Brazil argues for a return to the bac\u2019s initial purpose\u2014providing a broad, industry\u2011linked skill set\u2014while warning that without such focus, the qualification risks becoming a redundant paperwork exercise rather than a genuine employment preparer.",
    "During the design review the team expanded the core remote\u2011control concept in several directions.  The user\u2011interface group presented a cradle\u2011style housing with a scroll wheel and a locator beacon that would allow the remote to \u201ccall\u201d itself from a base\u2011station.  They also discussed adding a trigger\u2011type button on the side to reduce accidental scrolling and a \u201cfind\u2011remote\u201d feature that would beep when the user presses a dedicated button.  The industrial designer suggested a single\u2011curved body with a rubber\u2011covered face for durability and a larger on\u2011off button for older users, while keeping the button layout grouped into three functional buckets (habitual, optional, and advanced).  Marketing pushed for a fashionable look, proposing the corporate colour and slogan on the back and a sleek silver/grey finish.  They also debated incorporating speech\u2011recognition or a voice\u2011activated microphone, noting that it would add cost and power demands but could appeal to a mid\u2011to\u2011high\u2011income demographic.  The finance team argued for a simple infra\u2011red transmitter to keep manufacturing time short and costs under \u20ac15.80 per unit, and questioned the viability of rechargeable batteries versus standard alkaline cells.  The group also considered future upgradeability (e.g., adding a smart chip or a USB charging dock) and the removal of teletext support per the new requirements.  Overall, the additional ideas focused on a minimalist yet ergonomic core remote, optional advanced features, and a stylish aesthetic that could be marketed to a mid\u2011priced segment.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) framed the remote\u2011control project around a **tight cost\u2011profit envelope** and a **broad, international market**. He set a **selling price of \u20ac25** and a **maximum production cost of \u20ac12.50** \u2013 a margin that would allow a **\u20ac50\u202fmillion profit target** if roughly **4\u202fmillion units** are sold. The PM stressed that the **price point must stay below \u20ac30** to remain competitive against existing single\u2011device remotes, and that any additional features must not push the unit cost beyond the \u20ac12.50 ceiling.\n\nRegarding **market range and target groups**, the PM described the product as a **\u201cuniversal, stylish, user\u2011friendly\u201d** remote that should appeal to **everyone from young adults to older users**. He noted that the remote should be \u201caccessible and usable by all age groups\u201d and that the brand\u2019s \u201cfashion\u2011in\u2011electronics\u201d ethos should guide the design. The PM explicitly said the target was **international \u2013 Europe, North America, Australia, etc.** \u2013 and that the remote should look \u201coriginal, trendy, and not just a cheap piece of plastic.\u201d\n\nOn **new features proposed by Marketing**, the PM was generally supportive but cautious. He welcomed the idea of an **LCD menu for programming up to eight devices** and a **universal infrared function**, but he warned that an LCD and additional chips would increase the bill of materials. He also entertained a **USB interface** for PC programming but flagged its cost. The PM concluded that the **multipurpose nature** was feasible only if the added cost stayed within the \u20ac12.50 cap.\n\nThe PM emphasized the **necessity of setting a clear selling target** (the 4\u202fmillion\u2011unit goal) as a way to measure feasibility and to drive the design toward a cost\u2011effective solution. He also highlighted that the next meeting should focus on **functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design** phases, with a specific agenda to review cost estimates, confirm the LCD feasibility, and solidify the sales target.",
    "User Interface (UI) expressed a pragmatic view of the project\u2019s financial and design constraints.  They repeatedly highlighted the tight production\u2011cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50 per unit, noting that the target selling price of \u20ac25 must be maintained to hit the company\u2019s 50\u202f% profit margin and the requirement to sell at least four million units to break even.  UI stressed that every feature added would need to be justified against this budget, especially the more expensive elements such as the voice\u2011recognition module and the kinetic battery system.\n\nRegarding the kinetic batteries, UI acknowledged that the original concept was attractive for its sleek, integrated look but also recognized the higher cost it would impose.  They suggested that the team consider moving to standard rechargeable batteries, arguing that customers had not voiced a strong preference for kinetic power and that the price lift from the kinetic cells would not be offset by a perceived value increase.  UI also noted that removing the voice\u2011recognition feature\u2014an optional \u201cbusiness\u2011class\u201d add\u2011on\u2014would further reduce cost and simplify the design without alienating the core user base.\n\nIn short, UI\u2019s stance was that the remote must stay within the \u20ac12.50 production cap, the \u20ac25 retail price, and the broader financial targets, and that any costly innovations (kinetic batteries, voice recognition) should be treated as optional or phased out if they jeopardize the budget.  They urged a lean, user\u2011friendly design that meets the essential functions while keeping the cost structure lean enough to achieve the planned profit and market volume goals.",
    "Marketing and the industrial designer clashed because each side was prioritising a different set of constraints for the future product.  \n\n**Kinetic\u2011energy concept**  \nMarketing viewed kinetic energy as a clean\u2011energy, \u201cgreen\u201d selling point that would differentiate the remote on the shelf and appeal to eco\u2011conscious customers. The marketing team saw it as a marketing hook that could be advertised in a high\u2011profile campaign.  \nThe industrial designer, however, was concerned with the practical side: adding a kinetic\u2011energy generator would require extra space, extra moving parts, and a new power\u2011management circuit. He questioned whether the energy produced would be sufficient for a remote\u2019s battery life, how it would affect reliability, and whether the added complexity would increase production cost and warranty risk. He also worried that users\u2014especially older adults\u2014might find a \u201cshake\u2011to\u2011power\u201d feature awkward or unnecessary.\n\n**Upgradability**  \nMarketing wanted an upgradable platform so that the remote could be refreshed with new features (e.g., voice control, additional buttons) without replacing the whole unit. This would create a longer product lifecycle and a recurring revenue stream.  \nThe industrial designer feared that designing for future upgrades would force a more modular, but also more complicated, architecture. It would raise manufacturing costs, increase the number of parts, and complicate the user interface, potentially confusing customers. He also raised concerns about warranty terms: an upgradable product would change the warranty scope and require a new support model.\n\nIn short, marketing pushed for features that would boost market appeal and profitability, while the industrial designer focused on feasibility, cost control, user experience, and long\u2011term reliability\u2014leading to the disagreements over kinetic energy and upgradability.",
    "The committee\u2019s discussion on HEFCW\u2019s powers of intervention centred on the 2015 Act\u2019s limited, \u201csoft\u2011power\u201d regime and the proposed new legislation that would give the Welsh government more direct tools to step in when higher\u2011education institutions fail to meet standards. Members noted that HEFCW has largely relied on informal guidance and \u201cmeeting\u2011without\u2011coffee\u201d approaches, and that the regulator had not yet exercised its statutory powers in a formal, punitive sense. The Minister acknowledged that while HEFCW has used its soft powers, the new Bill will introduce a graduated scale of intervention, from advisory to enforceable sanctions, to address the sector\u2019s growing complexity.\n\nThe committee also asked whether the new powers would affect the autonomy of further\u2011education (FE) and higher\u2011education (HE) providers, especially in the context of the pandemic\u2011driven closures. The Minister confirmed that universities and colleges remain autonomous but that the Bill will give the government the ability to issue temporary directives to keep institutions open or to intervene if closures threaten students\u2019 learning. She stressed that the government is in ongoing conversations with FE and HE bodies to understand their plans for online delivery and to ensure that vulnerable learners are protected. No concrete decision was taken on closures; instead, the committee agreed that the Bill\u2019s expanded powers would provide a framework for future intervention, while the government would continue to negotiate with providers on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis.",
    "The team\u2019s marketing plan centers on positioning a premium, universal remote as a stylish, high\u2011quality accessory that can control TVs, DVD players, and other home\u2011entertainment devices worldwide. They set a retail price of \u20ac25 and a target profit of \u20ac50\u202fmillion, which implies a per\u2011unit margin of \u20ac12.5 (cost \u20ac12.50) and roughly 4\u202fmillion units sold to hit the goal. To keep costs low, the design will use hard plastic for the case, rubber\u2011covered buttons, and a simple infrared transmitter that works with PAL, NTSC, and other formats.\n\nKey differentiation tactics include:\n* **Universal compatibility** \u2013 a single remote that can switch between TV, DVD, and other devices with a dedicated \u201cswitch\u201d button, making it easy for users to learn.\n* **Customisable \u201cfaces\u201d** \u2013 interchangeable front panels that can be bought separately, allowing consumers to match the remote to their d\u00e9cor or personal style.\n* **Premium design cues** \u2013 sleek, ergonomic shape, high\u2011quality materials, and subtle branding that evokes a \u201cJohn\u202fLewis\u201d\u2011style luxury feel.\n* **Target\u2011segment focus** \u2013 while the remote is easy for grandparents to use, the modern aesthetic and optional touch\u2011screen concept appeal to tech\u2011savvy consumers and younger buyers.\n* **Global reach** \u2013 the remote will be marketed in multiple languages and sold through online and retail channels worldwide, ensuring broad exposure.\n\nThe marketing team will conduct competitive analysis, gather consumer insights, and refine the positioning to highlight the remote\u2019s ease of use, design, and versatility. By combining a compelling premium image with a tight cost structure and a clear volume target, the group believes it can achieve the projected \u20ac50\u202fmillion profit.",
    "During the pandemic\u2011focused session, ministers and senior advisers outlined a coordinated policy response to keep children healthy and fed while schools closed or operated at reduced capacity.  The Welsh Government emphasised that the \u201cHealthy Weight: Healthy Wales\u201d strategy would remain a priority, with a focus on early\u2011years and school\u2011age children.  Physical education was identified as a key lever; ministers noted that schools would receive statutory guidance on PE and that schools were encouraged to use the new \u201cnew purpose\u201d framework to embed regular activity even when face\u2011to\u2011face lessons were limited.  The discussion also covered the use of the emergency legislation that allows temporary closure or opening of schools and childcare premises, and the possibility of relaxing staff\u2011to\u2011child ratios to keep essential services running.\n\nFood provision for free\u2011school\u2011meal children was a central concern.  Ministers confirmed that the existing free\u2011meal programme would continue throughout the pandemic, with schools expected to maintain or extend meal services even during holidays.  They stressed that the quality of food was paramount, urging schools to improve nutrition standards and to consider guidance on packed lunches, while recognising that parents should not be policed.  The government pledged to keep funding for early\u2011years and voluntary youth services, and to maintain support for schools that might otherwise close.  Overall, the meeting reaffirmed a holistic approach\u2014policy, physical activity, and nutrition\u2014aimed at safeguarding children\u2019s health and well\u2011being during the crisis.",
    "User Interface (UI) chose a curved keypad and an ergonomic shape for the new remote because the curvature would naturally contour to the hand, making the device feel \u201cbiomorphic\u201d and easier to hold for both right\u2011 and left\u2011hand users. The single curve was preferred over a double\u2011curved version to keep costs down while still allowing the joystick to sit comfortably on the top edge and the LCD screen to be visible. A rubber grip was added to the underside so the remote would feel spongy, reduce bulk, and prevent it from slipping, all of which contributed to a more ergonomic, robust feel.\n\nThe team agreed that the remote needed to score high on four criteria: **easy to use, fashion, easy to find, and robust**.  \n*Easy to use* was achieved by reducing the button count to two and a joystick, moving menu navigation to the remote itself, and discussing a potential voice\u2011response feature (though it was ultimately dropped for cost reasons).  \n*Fashion* was driven by the \u201cfruit and veg\u201d trend that Real Reactions promotes; the remote was shaped like a banana, painted yellow, and wrapped in a rubber \u201cspongy\u201d material to make it a visual statement.  \n*Easy to find* was addressed by choosing a bright yellow colour and a rubber exterior that would stand out in a cluttered living\u2011room. The locator feature was considered but later removed due to budget constraints.  \n*Robust* was ensured by the use of durable rubber, a solid plastic chassis, and a design that could withstand drops and rough handling.\n\nDuring the discussion, UI evaluated the fashion style by comparing the prototype\u2019s banana shape and yellow colour to current clothing and accessory trends, rating it on a 1\u20117 scale in the evaluation sheet. They noted that a \u201cfashion\u2011conscious\u201d target group would appreciate the bright, fruit\u2011inspired look, and they gave it a high score (6\u20117) for fashion, reinforcing the decision to keep the curved, spongy, yellow design."
