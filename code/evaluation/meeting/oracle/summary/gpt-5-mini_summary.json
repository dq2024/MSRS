    "Changes the group said were needed\n- Hardware/software: populate the donated IBM box (more CPUs), get code running on it (Linux), and port/parallelize the slow training/decoding tasks (neural\u2011net training and HTK runs) so the new machine is actually usable.\n- Recognition experiments: decide a small, focused set of experiments (feature sets, multi\u2011band, cross\u2011language tests), retrain nets with corrected on\u2011line normalization, and pick which comparisons to run before the next meeting.\n- Data collection/process: start recruitment (target \u224850 subjects), finalize scheduling and agenda for the subject sessions, and run a small pilot batch (~10) to tune the elicitation materials.\n- Transcription/formatting tools: integrate hand\u2011marked time tags (CTM/Transcriber) into the alignment workflow, produce a small set of ground\u2011truth alignments for tuning, and make format/tool improvements so transcripts, alignments and prosodic links are usable.\n- Consent/forms: use the approved consent form but add a check/initial option for subjects who do NOT want to see the final transcript; resolve any release/waiver details with Jane.\n\nProfessor\u2019s opinion on English use\n- He emphasized producing English materials: not everyone reads German, so provide English translations (templates, ontology snippets, parser/generator mappings) and copy key people (Jane) on drafts. He supported creating an English parser equivalent to the German one and using English versions of forms/content so the wider group can review and work with the data.",
    "They treated \u201cvalue\u201d as where each input should live (user model vs situation model) and what concrete form it should take for decisions. User-model values are stable/person traits (identity, interests, financial style \u2014 cheap/average/spendy), while situation-model values capture temporally varying facts (is the site open, accessible, current budget remaining). They emphasized splitting influences into intermediate, compact nodes (e.g., a \u201ccompatibility\u201d or \u201cfit\u201d node) so many user and situational features don\u2019t all point directly at decisions (to avoid combinatorial explosion).\n\nOn the user budget specifically they agreed:\n- Budget is best modeled as a numeric, running quantity (how much money the user currently has/has left).\n- This numeric budget should be treated as an externally updated node (updates come from actions/spending outside belief\u2011net inference), not as a regular belief update.\n- Decisions don\u2019t use raw numbers: you need converters/ranges or decision\u2011specific thresholds (map numeric budget to categorical ranges relevant to a particular decision).\n- Budget interacts with trait finance (thriftiness) \u2014 finance is a policy/trait node, budget is resource; both can feed into \u201ccan afford/compatible\u201d precondition nodes.\n- They raised practical issues: whether to propagate belief updates on every budget change or lazily, and how to avoid exploding CPTs by grouping features (e.g., merge selling/fixing/servicing into a summary node for entry decisions).\n\nOverall they favored explicit numeric budget with decision\u2011specific discretization, external updates, and encapsulation via intermediate compatibility nodes to keep the belief\u2011net tractable.",
    "Participants agreed the Canadian economy was facing \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d because of COVID\u201119 and described a suite of emergency measures (CERB extension, wage subsidy adjustments, rent relief, provincial funding proposals, and liquidity facilities). Ministers stressed ongoing transparency \u2014 biweekly reporting to Parliament on costs and the promise to provide a full fiscal/economic update \u201cas soon as it\u2019s possible\u201d with clear projections. There was also discussion of sectoral supports (forestry, fisheries, large\u2011employer financing).\n\nCathy McLeod (Conservative) was sharply critical. She argued the economy was already weak pre\u2011COVID, condemned the government\u2019s refusal or delay to table a national economic update, accused the government of sidelining Parliament, and pressed for immediate, concrete supports (for example, an updated softwood lumber transition plan). She portrayed the government as opaque and failing to give businesses and households the fiscal clarity they need.\n\nMona Fortier (Associate Minister of Finance) defended the government\u2019s approach: she repeatedly acknowledged the unprecedented uncertainty, emphasized the biweekly public reporting of the response plan\u2019s cost and status, and reiterated the commitment to release a comprehensive economic update and projections when reliable data permit. She framed the government\u2019s priority as getting rapid support to Canadians while preparing more detailed projections later.\n\nGabriel Ste\u2011Marie (Bloc) welcomed anti\u2011tax\u2011evasion conditions on emergency loans in principle but criticized the measures as too weak: he warned that legally structured tax avoidance (use of tax\u2011haven subsidiaries) could still let large firms access public funds, and pressed for stricter scrutiny and transparency in granting financial support.",
    "The industrial designer identified several tiger characteristics worth studying as inspiration for the remote-control design:\n\n- Physical presence: big and strong \u2014 suggesting a product that feels solid and substantial, or conveys robustness despite being lightweight.  \n- Visual identity: stripes \u2014 a distinctive, high-contrast pattern that could drive surface texture, button layout, or aesthetic detailing to make the remote recognizably original.  \n- Hunting strategy: deliberate, well-thought stalking \u2014 implying purposeful, efficient interaction design (clear affordances, minimal wasted steps, focused functions).  \n- Stealth and concealment: seeks hide spots and security \u2014 pointing to ergonomic shaping for secure grip, discreet integration into the living environment, or protective casing and safe storage features.  \n- Cautiousness/security orientation \u2014 could inform durable materials, reassuring tactile feedback, and controls designed to minimize accidental inputs.\n\nIn short, the designer focused on the tiger\u2019s strength and striking visual pattern plus its strategic, security-focused behavior; these map to robustness, distinctive styling (stripes), efficient/intuitive user flows, ergonomic security, and discreet placement or protective design in the remote-control concept.",
    "They found the current Transcriber interface limiting for encoding overlaps and multi\u2011channel work and discussed several alternatives and fixes.\n\nKey problems noted\n- Overlaps aren\u2019t encoded with precise start/end times; the interface forces coarse overlap handling.\n- Waveform display is slow (Tcl/Tk), so switching visuals between channels is impractical; loading individual waveforms takes minutes.\n- Transcribers mostly rely on audio (mixed signal) but need quick, easy ways to switch to individual channels when overlaps or faint speech occur.\n- Deleting vs inserting short missed segments is awkward; semantics of where to attach a tiny segment are unclear.\n\nProposed changes and alternatives\n- Modify Transcriber (Dave Gelbart and Grad A volunteered/hacked on it) to: show the mix waveform but let transcribers listen to individual channels quickly (click to switch audio rather than menu), and output separate channel files to preserve overlaps.\n- Consider multi\u2011track \u201cmusical score\u201d style editors (single timeline, multiple channels) as the ideal representation.\n- Evaluate existing tools: Munich\u2019s speech/non\u2011speech segmenter helped speed transcription but fails on overlap; Praat was noted but thought not ideal; CMU tool (Susanne Burger) can do 8\u2011channel transliterations and is worth trying; some in\u2011house tools exist but may be unsupported.\n- Workarounds: open multiple Transcriber windows (one per channel) or preload chopped channel segments for faster visual navigation, and retain automatically detected segments (mark with an \u201cX\u201d or tag) instead of deleting so forced alignment/post\u2011processing can use them.\n\nOverall decision: continue with Transcriber for now, pursue targeted modifications and test other multi\u2011channel tools to improve overlap encoding and channel switching.",
    "The three presentations converged on a single concept: a fashion-forward yet simple remote built from readily available components. Components design: manufacturing can supply flat, single- or double\u2011curved cases; push\u2011buttons are standard (company expertise), a scroll/wheel is optional, and LCDs require an advanced chip. PCB/chip options are simple, regular or advanced; feedback speakers, docking/base station and off\u2011the\u2011shelf wireless parts are feasible. Power options considered AA batteries (preferred), kinetic charging as a backup, and solar (limited by latex/rubber casing).\n\nMarket findings & trends: market research and trend\u2011watching (Paris/Milan) prioritize \u201cfancy\u201d look and feel above ease\u2011of\u2011use, with a current vogue for \u201cfruity/vegetable\u201d shapes, spongy/grippy materials and bright/catchy colours for younger buyers; older users prefer darker, traditional palettes. Price sensitivity (~\u20ac25 target) and brand credibility were stressed.\n\nConceptual UI/specs: keep primary controls large and tactile\u2014power, volume, channel skip/up\u2011down\u2014and numeric entry for direct channel access. Advanced features (TV guide, settings, parental controls, profiles) should be menu\u2011driven, either via an on\u2011screen TV display or small internal LCD. Debate centered on LCD value (trendy vs fragile), scroll wheel usefulness (good for menus but not essential) and including optional voice recognition and audible feedback.\n\nProperties/materials & customization: recommendation for plastic main body with rubber/latex outer grip or two\u2011tone cushions; titanium/wood considered niche. Removable covers for colour/texture variation were proposed to capture fashion trends while keeping core electronics standard. Market approach: present as a single trusted brand, balance flashiness with subtlety, and stage advanced features to control cost.",
    "The committee heard that early implementer pilots have been broadly encouraging and are being used deliberately to learn before full roll\u2011out. Key lessons identified:\n\n- Administrative burden: paper-based eligibility checks (pay slips, birth certificates, changing circumstances) are resource\u2011intensive for local authorities and confusing for parents in partially piloted areas. Ministers favour a centralised, HMRC\u2011style system with departmental data\u2011sharing to reduce bureaucracy.\n\n- Uneven and pent\u2011up demand: take\u2011up is not evenly distributed (economic and cultural drivers matter). In some valley communities informal family childcare reduces demand; in others demand is high, including enquiries from families outside pilot zones. Partial pilots within authorities cause eligibility confusion.\n\n- Capacity and workforce: so far pilots have not revealed insurmountable capacity problems (including Welsh\u2011medium and special needs), but gaps exist regionally. Mitigations include \u00a360m capital, a 10\u2011year workforce plan, targeted funding for Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin, and local childcare sufficiency assessments. Ministers are confident phased scaling and local action with colleges/providers can meet demand.\n\n- Pricing and quality tensions: the \u00a34.50 hourly contribution is broadly supported but may need reviewing in higher\u2011cost areas; there is concern about add\u2011on charges (food/transport) disadvantaging poorest families. Quality and pay increases could pressure the rate.\n\n- Monitoring and communication: ongoing evaluation (termly updates, Arad review) will inform adjustments; clear national communication to parents and providers (including links to UK tax\u2011free childcare) is essential.\n\nThe overall lesson: phased, evidence\u2011led piloting with improved digital administration, strong local planning and active evaluation reduces risk versus a big\u2011bang roll\u2011out.",
    "The Project Manager was cautious about speech/voice recognition: he concluded it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the initial product (too immature, limited keyword-spotting functionality, and largely gimmicky for TV use) and explicitly pushed to drop speech recognition from the first prototype. Cost and feasibility drove many decisions: management set tight unit-cost targets (production cost target ~\u20ac12.50, retail \u20ac25), so trade\u2011offs were required. As a result the PM insisted on removing expensive options (speech recognition and some special cosmetic choices) to stay within budget.\n\nOn LCDs he was pragmatic: an LCD was seen as useful (menu/navigation, program names, interactive guide) and arguably more worthwhile than speech recognition, but it is expensive and raises requirements (internet or intermediary hardware to feed data). He accepted that an LCD might be added only if cost and connectivity issues can be solved; otherwise TV-screen/menu interaction or a minimal on\u2011device display was preferred.\n\nRegarding buttons and controls the PM favored a minimal, ergonomic approach: retain essential physical controls (power, volume, channel) and a small set of navigation controls (scroll wheels/joystick, a menu/OK function, and possibly a \u201cturbo\u201d scroll mode). He supported keeping tactile push buttons for traditional users, adding two scroll wheels/thumb wheel ideas, a locating/beeper function (base station), a rubber \u201cspongy\u201d cover and curved ergonomic form, and offering changeable covers for fashion without raising base costs.",
    "They discussed standardizing and improving audio capture and whether to add video. Key points and decisions:\n\nMicrophones / recording conventions\n- Consensus to standardize on close\u2011talking/head\u2011mounted mics (same make/model) to reduce channel variability that hurts transcription, prosody work, and ASR. Action: buy a half dozen of the preferred headset and replace failing wired mics; consider wireless base\u2011station chaining to expand channels.\n- Continue recording separate channels where possible and time\u2011align with the meeting start (rather than collapsing to a single mixed channel) to preserve per\u2011mic data for later processing.\n- Modify tools (multi\u2011trans) to support multi\u2011channel recordings and finer time\u2011marking/overlaps; use pre\u2011segmentation and channel\u2011based speech/non\u2011speech detection to produce chunks suitable for forced alignment and ASR.\n- Acknowledged practical limits: disk space, board channel limits, and synchronization/skew issues. If external groups want microphone arrays, they can bring a separate, synchronized setup (possibly not tied to ICSI\u2019s main recording) and transfer data elsewhere.\n\nVideo and arrays\n- Video and microphone arrays are seen as useful but raise infrastructure, privacy/human\u2011subjects, and personnel concerns. No internal push to routinely collect video/large arrays.\n- Preferred route: collaborate with NIST/LDC/other groups who have resources and interest; offer the physical room, transcripts, and participation but let them deploy their own array/video setup if needed.\n- Human\u2011subjects/consent: reinforced need to make participants able to review/bleep material; web workflow decided (email contact, optional passworded access) with controls to avoid over\u2011editing.\n\nOverall: standardize mics now, enhance multi\u2011channel tooling; defer routine video/array collection unless partnered with groups that provide infrastructure and handle sync/storage.",
    "They raised finance early as a hard constraint: a target retail price of \u20ac25 (with an aspirational \u20ac50M profit mentioned) and the need to meet the project\u2019s finance criteria before final sign\u2011off. The team expected a few minor budget issues and debated ways to reduce cost: outsource manufacturing to lower\u2011cost countries, remove or simplify expensive components (the \u201csample speaker\u201d and some locator features were identified as costly gimmicks), replace the sample speaker with a simple beeper, and simplify the interface hardware (use pushbuttons instead of a costly scroll\u2011wheel assembly). They repeatedly noted they lacked upfront component cost data and said having a cost sheet earlier would have helped. After trimming features they reported being comfortably under budget (with only a small leftover amount), but agreed to flag potential extra\u2011cost options (colour/pattern finishes, special materials) for management review.\n\nOn the drawing board/whiteboard use, the group valued it highly. They used the whiteboard for freehand sketches, rapid layout iterations, and to augment the static PowerPoint slides \u2014 enabling on\u2011the\u2011fly changes, brainstorming, and clearer communication of second\u2011level menus and button placement. The project manager explicitly said the whiteboard plus PowerPoint worked well, allowing dynamic changes that slides alone couldn\u2019t. They also discussed saving those drawings into the project folder so the sketches become part of the record. Overall whiteboarding was seen as essential to ideation and quick design adjustments.",
    "The Industrial Designer repeatedly focused on form, ergonomics and manufacturability: button layout and feel, the single vs double curve casing, tactile materials (rubber vs plastic), special button shapes/colours, and how those choices affect user comfort (repetitive-strain concerns). They advocated keeping key technical features (kinetic charging, LCD, voice/location aids) if feasible but stressed trade-offs with cost and argued that functional features matter more than purely aesthetic choices. They also pushed for simple, familiar interactions (big volume/channel controls, an easy lock) and suggested modular/replaceable faceplates and a locator function to address loss.\n\nThe Project Manager concentrated on scope, finance and coordination: a \u20ac25 target retail price and the need to keep production cost around \u20ac12.50, prioritizing simplicity and market fit. They repeatedly steered discussions toward cost-driven trade-offs (drop or downgrade features to meet budget), encouraged pragmatic choices (infra-red and batteries rather than Bluetooth/complex tech), and emphasized maintaining the company\u2019s corporate identity. They also managed the meeting process, evaluation criteria and follow-ups.\n\nFrom the team presentations the Project Manager concluded: the group was broadly aligned around a basic TV remote concept with some advanced touches (LCD, ergonomic improvements), but budget pressures require compromises (plastic casing instead of rubber, possibly dropping expensive speech recognition). The PM decided to document the agreed trade-offs, prioritize infra-red/battery design, keep the LCD if affordable, preserve brand identity, and pursue further research (ergonomics, cost breakdown) before finalizing features.",
    "They treated the base question as a trade\u2011off between form factor and features. Early on the team debated a charging/standing base with rechargeable batteries versus a pocketable battery\u2011only unit. Arguments for a base: it doubles as a charger, can house larger chips (e.g., for voice/location), and supports an eco\u2011friendly rechargeable model. Arguments against: customers of small, trendy devices dislike a bulky base; a base forces a larger remote; it adds cost and complexity. Several members favored a small, locator\u2011equipped handset (no base) as \u201csmaller is hotter,\u201d but the project manager repeatedly proposed a rechargeable stand as a compromise. No final unanimous decision was reached\u2014discussion ended with a leaning toward lithium battery power and considering a rechargeable stand as an option rather than a mandatory feature.\n\nOn fashionability they weighed trend vs longevity. Market research showed buyers prefer \u201cfancy\u201d look-and-feel over purely functional designs, but worried about fleeting trends (fruit/veg prints). They favored an organic, ergonomic silhouette (fruit\u2011inspired curves, spongy/latex texture, yellow accents, gunmetal plastic base) and interchangeable facia/covers so style can be updated without redesigning electronics. They wanted a fashion\u2011forward product aimed at 25\u201335\u2011year\u2011olds while avoiding gimmicky extremes.\n\nWhen reviewing existing remotes they noted pros: intuitive standard layouts, tactile raised symbols, useful scroll wheels, some accessibility aids. Cons included overcrowded buttons, confusing shape\u2011to\u2011function mappings, missing covers, costly/extraneous LCDs, false triggers with voice, and increased chip/size/cost for advanced features. These tradeoffs guided their push for a simple, ergonomic, stylish remote with selective tech (speech finder, LED feedback) rather than full LCD or excess complexity.",
    "They discussed several linked issues:\n\n- Environmental-friendly material: the industrial designer proposed shape\u2011memory alloys so returned units can be heated to disassemble for reuse/recycling. Company could outsource end\u2011of\u2011life processing; cost and machinery implications were noted.\n\n- Current trend: marketing research and fashion-watchers point to \u201cfruits & vegetables\u201d (bright, primary colours) and spongy/tactile surfaces as this season\u2019s trend. Management stresses \u201cfancy look & feel\u201d ranks above functionality.\n\n- Potential materials: options included hard plastic (main case), titanium (backplate) and wood, rubber/latex or spongy soft covers, coloured plastics, phosphorescent/glow materials. Titanium offers a premium feel but has forming/curving limits and cost/weight concerns. Latex/spongy outer over a hard inner shell was suggested for grip and comfort.\n\n- LCD screen: debated heavily. Pros\u2014on-device menus/feedback; cons\u2014advanced chip needed (higher cost), backlighting/visibility issues in dark, one\u2011way communication limits info from TV, management flagged teletext/internet constraints. Alternative: on\u2011TV on\u2011screen menu controlled by the remote to avoid expensive on\u2011remote display.\n\n- Colour: strong preference for fruit-inspired, interchangeable faceplates/covers (packaging/collectible editions). Logo placement on back; contrasts and mismatched colour combinations accepted.\n\n- Spongy material: proposed as removable covers or thin latex overlay (grip, ergonomic). Concerns about protecting internals and manufacturability; suggested prototype testing and cost checks.\n\n- Material vs. function tradeoffs: many feature vs cost tensions\u2014scroll wheel requires regular chip, LCD requires advanced chip, speech recognition is attractive but expensive/noisy, kinetic/solar power impractical or costly. Glow vs momentary backlight affects battery life.\n\n- Questionnaire/market data: indicated willingness to pay for stylish remotes (80%+.), high interest in voice recognition (~91% reported), but responses vary by age. Findings pushed team toward fashion-first priorities while cautioning on budget/target audience.",
    "Project Manager, User Interface and Industrial Designer introductions\n- Project Manager opened by restating goals: stay within a strict component budget (\u2248\u20ac12.50), sell price target (\u20ac25), define target group and functions, and collect the three presentations. He emphasized cost/feasibility and that management had forbidden teletext and multi-device control unless strongly justified.\n- User Interface presented two prototype concepts: a low\u2011cost, conventional TV\u2011only \u201csurfboard/banana\u201d remote (~\u20ac8 build) with familiar button layout; and a higher\u2011function version with an LCD, integrated microphone for speech recognition, status LEDs and a cover (costly, ~\u20ac16+ with SR). UI argued for small size, essential buttons (power, channel, volume, numbers, menu) and optional voice if budget allows.\n- Industrial Designer described the ergonomic surfboard shape, soft rubber/spongy feel, illuminated or glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark/tactile buttons, interchangeable covers for fashion, and sustainability ideas (shape\u2011memory alloys for easy disassembly).\n\nMulti\u2011functional vs single\u2011functional\n- The group leaned toward a single\u2011function TV remote to keep costs down, simplify compatibility and improve usability. Multifunction (VCR/DVD etc.) was judged too complex/costly and unnecessary per management.\n\nWhy lower technological grades were given\n- Evaluators penalized the prototype\u2019s technological score because the basic model offered little innovation beyond form; planned tech features (LCD, speech recognition) were dropped for budget reasons, reducing novelty. Cost constraints forced simpler chips and fewer features, hence lower tech ratings.\n\nLocator consideration in requirements\n- Locator ideas were discussed: a blinking LED indicating battery/locator, a TV\u2011side tag/button that triggers a beep on the handset, and adhesive modules to stick to any TV. The locator was treated as a practical, low\u2011cost alternative to more expensive tech (voice/LCD) and included in functional requirements discussion.",
    "PhD A and PhD C agreed that the current variance/normalization approach needs rethinking: subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation in the log-energy domain may be inappropriate and can compress differences they want to detect. They recommended first inspecting simple, unnormalized energy distributions (histograms) and linear energy as a baseline, then testing how different normalizations and windows affect separability. Both supported Jose\u2019s (PhD E\u2019s) suggestions: vary the analysis window (including moving/short windows rather than a fixed 200 ms), try linear vs log energy, and avoid assuming one normalization fits all overlap types. They also agreed pitch/harmonicity features are promising and should be added after the basic energy checks; ultimately a discriminative system combining multiple features is likely needed.\n\nThey identified several overlap-related problems and difficulties: large heterogeneity of overlap types (backchannels vs full interruptions), overlapping feature distributions (partial or no separation), per-speaker gain and speaking-rate differences, and artifacts from crude gain normalization. Overlaps produce recognition insertions from background speech and complicate segmentation (speech/non-speech and which speaker overlaps which). Practical needs include forced alignment, manual or semi-automated labeling/taxonomy of overlap types (or focused pairwise speaker analyses), and careful choice of normalization/windowing per overlap class. The takeaway: start simple (energy histograms, linear measures), explore window/normalization effects per overlap type, then add pitch/harmonics and combine features in a discriminative model.",
    "They discussed latency arising from the smoothing/recursion used in the noise\u2011compensation (spectral subtraction/Wiener) stage. The smoothing estimates a running mean (or gain curve) using a centered/recursive filter that looks into the future, so the algorithm requires a short look\u2011ahead instead of using only past frames. Professor C objected because SmartKom is an interactive system \u2014 added look\u2011ahead increases response delay, degrades the user experience (first utterances will see worse recognition until the filter \u201cramps up\u201d), and could create scheduling/engineering problems later if latency was ignored and then needed to be reduced.\n\nSpecific durations mentioned:\n- The recursive smoothing/mean estimation was said to introduce a short delay; one participant explicitly gives \u201cfive zero\u201d (i.e. ~50 ms) as the delay for that recursion/look\u2011ahead.\n- Much longer time windows were discussed for mean estimation experiments (examples: 12 seconds, and experiments with 2, 4, 6, 8 seconds). These are modeling windows, not necessarily per\u2011utterance interactive latency, but they affect how long the filter needs to converge.\n- Other system latencies discussed include a 24\u2011frame buffer (first frame in that buffer suffers a 24\u2011frame latency) and example FFT/frame choices (64 ms FFT frames, 500 ms tiles for noise minima), which determine practical buffering delays.\nProfessor C recommended being conservative about added latency, considering second\u2011pass processing or gradual ramp\u2011up strategies so interactivity isn\u2019t harmed.",
    "User Interface introduced a detailed prototype design with these primary features:\n- Ergonomic, biomorphic case (options: wood, plastic or titanium finish) with customizable colours/backs and an \u201coyster\u201d holder.  \n- Flip panel with a yellow LCD display (optional if cost too high) and a jog wheel to navigate on-screen menus.  \n- Prominent, raised controls: a large yellow on/off button, numeric pad, volume and channel controls, an elongated fluorescent-green menu/LED button that also allows channel swapping.  \n- Integrated speech recognition with a dedicated on/off control and recommended microphone placement (side) so voice works whether the flip is closed or open.  \n- Soft rubber, tactile buttons sized/recessed for one-thumb, one-hand operation (accessible for small hands and both left/right users).  \n- Simple electronics strategy (chip-on-print, IR emitter, sample speaker, rechargeable/battery options) and potential energy-harvesting ideas for button presses.  \n- International-friendly labeling (symbols) and modularity so expensive features (LCD, voice chip) can be removed to meet budget.\n\nAdvantages highlighted:\n- Strong usability: single-hand/thumb reachability, tactile raised buttons, and speech control improve convenience and accessibility.  \n- Market differentiation: voice recognition, distinctive biomorphic styling and customisation give clear marketing hooks.  \n- Flexibility and cost control: modular design lets team trade off LCD/voice features to meet budget; many elements remain within projected cost.  \n- Comfort and perceived quality: weighted, soft-touch materials increase perceived control and desirability.  \n- Customisation + online sales fit: allows personalised options for web configurators, increasing appeal and potential sales.",
    "Presentation: The team presented a playful, ergonomic \u201cfruit\u201d prototype \u2014 commonly called the banana remote \u2014 with a curved, hand-shaped body (double- or single-curve options), colourful/spongy exterior and a matching weighted base station with a banana-leaf antenna motif. Key controls shown were two scroll wheels (volume and channel), a turbo/trigger button, a central joystick/jog-button option (360\u00b0 movement with click/double-click), a small numeric keypad in some mock-ups, and an embedded locator/beeper via the base station. Power options discussed included rechargeable cells, a recharger dock (and optional solar cells or kinetic generator ideas). Materials debated: rubber/spongy finish versus titanium look or titanium-coloured plastic; durability and manufacturability were considered.\n\nDiscussion: The group argued ergonomics (hand fit, left/right handedness), fashion vs. functionality (fruit/veggie trend aimed at youth), and strict cost targets (~\u20ac12.5 retail). LCD and speech recognition (ASR/keyword spotting) were explored: ASR existed in-house but was limited (keyword/phrase matching) and costly/immature for TV control; LCD added expense and uncertain value. Modular design surfaced repeatedly \u2014 detachable/add-on modules for ASR, parental control, big-button senior module, and optional LCD \u2014 to let customers pay for features they want.\n\nConclusion: They agreed to build two prototype versions: a basic, budget-first model without LCD/ASR (fewer buttons, two scroll wheels, locator, spongy/banana styling) to meet cost constraints; and a higher-end modular version that can include LCD and/or speech/other modules later. Next steps: produce physical prototypes, refine materials/curves, evaluate costs in finance review and run market/focus tests.",
    "They explored several options but tempered choices by cost, manufacturability and core functionality.\n\nTouch screen\n- Seen as highly marketable and modern, but expensive. Engineering estimated the touchscreen would push unit cost well above their target, forcing a much higher retail price or reduced margins. Given budget limits and timelines they effectively deprioritized full touch\u2011screen for this generation and agreed to table it for a later model or pilot.\n\nFlip screens / flip\u2011top design\n- A flip/top panel was popular as a lower\u2011cost way to add a display and protect buttons. It would lock buttons when closed, house less\u2011used functions and provide context\u2011sensitive prompts (useful for voice training). They discussed flip, slide or compartment approaches as affordable alternatives to a touchscreen while keeping the main interface simple.\n\nBattery issues\n- Multiple power options were debated: standard AAA were bulky; rechargeable (mobile\u2011phone style) with a charger dock was attractive; solar was favored for environmental branding but would need a small backup battery for low\u2011light situations. Kinetic energy harvesting was mentioned but unlikely to power a display. They noted manufacturer constraints (no lithium supply from current vendor) so some battery choices could require sourcing outside current manufacturing partners.\n\nOverall trade\u2011off\n- Given budget and component limits they prioritized lower\u2011cost, in\u2011house voice recognition plus a simple ergonomic case with a flip\u2011top/secondary display and rechargeable/solar\u2011plus\u2011backup power, postponing high\u2011cost touchscreen integration.",
    "The Government says it has taken a number of clear, practical lessons from the three\u2011year Schools Challenge Cymru (SCC) programme and has begun embedding them across the school improvement system. Key lessons adopted:\n- Leadership matters: strong, capable headship is central to sustained change.  \n- Systems and processes: schools need robust individual pupil tracking and data systems to target support and measure impact.  \n- Teacher quality and pedagogy: improve classroom practice as the primary route to better outcomes.  \n- Collaborative working: a self\u2011improving system where schools learn from one another is essential.  \n- Evidence\u2011based, targeted interventions: use PDG and other resources on proven approaches and evaluate impact.  \n- Multi\u2011agency responses: attendance, behaviour and looked\u2011after children require joined\u2011up support beyond school budgets.\n\nHow the programme is progressing:\n- SCC was intentionally time\u2011limited; its expertise and many key staff were transitioned into regional consortia and school improvement services to scale impact across more schools. Over \u00a310m was invested to build regional capacity.  \n- Improvement boards continue and the schools categorisation system now entitles red schools to 25 days of intensive support. Several SCC schools have sustained improvement (examples cited include Tredegar and Eastern High).  \n- Estyn monitoring (2017) reports three of four consortia are making strong progress, though outcomes were mixed: SCC worked well in some schools but not all.  \n- The Government commissioned an external evaluation (ICF) and has appointed regional PDG advisers to spread best practice and strengthen accountability. Ongoing work continues to apply SCC lessons across the national mission.",
    "Dr Blaney\u2019s view is that Brexit poses a real risk to Wales\u2019 higher education capacity\u2014mainly by threatening income streams (EU students, structural funds, EU research) and making collaborative research links more uncertain. He stresses his apolitical stance but says uncertainty itself is one of the most damaging immediate effects.\n\nOn the drop in EU (and some non\u2011EU) applicants he sees two main causes. First, changes to student support for EU entrants (loss of the previous grant) have created a perturbation in demand that he hopes is temporary; Wales\u2019 fee deal is no worse than England\u2019s and, with slightly lower fees, could be relatively attractive. Second, longer\u2011standing underinvestment in campus facilities and capital in Wales makes some institutions less competitive in a global recruitment market: facilities, perceived quality and a smaller number of high\u2011tariff institutions all affect choices. He also notes demographic pressures and loan/fee changes affect wider cohorts.\n\nWhy choose Wales? Dr Blaney highlights positive selling points: a UK\u2011quality degree often at slightly lower fee levels, a safer and more supportive environment (smaller, less intimidating cities), and strong pockets of research excellence (e.g. S\u00ear Cymru) and impact. He supports collective marketing (Study in Wales) to better differentiate Wales internationally and urges maintaining research quality and critical mass to protect the student experience and international appeal.",
    "Domains in the mental-space account (as discussed) are not single formal objects but a small set of recurrent kinds of \u201cspaces\u201d the grammar/semantics can build and reference. Useful domain types described in the meetings are:\n\n- Base/deictic space: the speaker\u2019s here-and-now (speech time, speaker/hearer roles, I/you).  \n- Temporal and spatial spaces: conventionalized deictic zones (past, future, here/there) and more complex spatial frames.  \n- Hypothetical/counterfactual spaces: conditionals and imagined scenarios (e.g., \u201cIf Nixon had\u2026\u201d or \u201cIn France \u2026\u201d).  \n- Reported/logophoric spaces: speaker- or source\u2011centered subspaces for reported thought/speech (role shifts, logophors).  \n- Attitude/evidential spaces: speaker belief, desire, sarcasm, evidentiality frames that carve off worlds with different status/probability.  \n- Scenario/Frame spaces: event/schema instances (container, path, agent, goal) and cultural/background frames used to flesh out meanings.  \n- Discourse-reference spaces: the set of discourse referents, accessibility/activation lists and anaphoric mappings.\n\nHow the middle layer would function\n- The \u201cmiddle layer\u201d is a set of latent/abstract nodes (intentions, tasks, plan-types, viewpoint choices) that mediate between surface cues (observables: verb choice, prosody, lexical items, mention of admission fee, time of day) and concrete semantic outputs (mode: Enter/Vista/Tango, which mental space to use, or a filled frame).  \n- Practically it is implemented as hidden variables (e.g., tourist vs. running\u2011errand, in\u2011a\u2011hurry, on\u2011tour) in a probabilistic model (Bayes-net / PRM). Observables provide evidence to infer middle-layer values; those inferred values constrain or select which mental space(s), frames, and bindings get instantiated downstream.  \n- Benefits: reduces combinatorial explosion, captures generalizations (many surface cues map to the same intention), supports graded inference, and cleanly connects discourse history/mental-space selection with semantic composition.  \n- Architecturally it can be layered/hierarchical (cue\u2011specific middles feeding higher plan/space choices) and re-used both for contextual reference resolution and for building the semantic specification of constructions.",
    "On the back-end: the professor thought the problem might lie in a too\u2011simple back\u2011end rather than the front end. He suggested trying the tandem features in the stronger SRI back\u2011end (i.e., feed improved features/HMMs into SRI) and re\u2011evaluating with larger training sets. He emphasized the importance of adaptation, boot models, and training details (VTL normalization, pruning, Baum\u2011Welch iterations, acoustic scaling) as potential causes of discrepancies, and recommended systematic checks (cross\u2011validation, testing on larger/full training sets and other corpora) before drawing conclusions. In short: don\u2019t assume the front end is solely to blame \u2014 improve/back\u2011test the back\u2011end and training pipeline.\n\nOn storing data: the professor favored keeping all recorded channels (including far\u2011field) if disk space permits, because acoustic researchers may need them. He proposed using the same infrastructure/tools but clearly labeling such data as a separate corpus or session type (so it isn\u2019t misclassified as a \u201cmeeting\u201d). For archiving he argued for buying more disk (cheap), using non\u2011backed up disks for active storage and doing a one\u2011time backup to tape for archive, rather than relying solely on CD/DVD (which degrade). He also supported getting additional file\u2011server capacity (fast server for active data, older server for rarely accessed archives) and handling backups/tape writes in a managed way.",
    "The committee repeatedly returned to the seniors care crisis after the Canadian Armed Forces\u2019 reports showed widespread neglect and infection in long\u2011term care (LTC) homes. Members condemned filth, missed medications, staffing failures and high death tolls; the government repeatedly said provinces hold primary jurisdiction but acknowledged a federal role in supporting provinces, offering assistance, working with premiers and committing to longer\u2011term reforms and investments to improve seniors\u2019 care. Several opposition members pressed for national standards, exclusion of profit from LTC and immediate criminal referrals; the government emphasized collaboration with provinces and additional supports (military, Red Cross, funding).\n\nRacism featured as a separate but related theme: witnesses and MPs noted racialized and marginalized groups have been disproportionately hit by COVID\u201119. Ministers pledged anti\u2011racism actions\u2014race\u2011based data collection, an anti\u2011racism secretariat and engagement with communities\u2014but there was no concrete federal policy explicitly tying anti\u2011racism reforms to LTC regulation; jurisdictions and provincial responsibility were stressed.\n\nOn protecting workers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 rights the government said it had amended insolvency/CCAA rules (budget measures, greater transparency and court discretion over executive bonuses) and committed to further measures to safeguard pensions and severance in restructurings, while urging continued consultations.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay signalled openness to public debate on veterans\u2019 compensation, citing work with the ombudsman and supplementary funding (about $90M mentioned) to address backlogs; he encouraged veterans and families to engage in conversations about policy and compensation.\n\nThe Minister of Seniors outlined pandemic assistance: a one\u2011time tax\u2011free top\u2011up\u2014$300 for OAS recipients, $200 for GIS recipients (combined with GST top\u2011up to reach cited totals for some)\u2014plus investments in New Horizons and community supports; she defended the choice of an immediate single payment while acknowledging further work on disability supports.",
    "They disagreed because each role prioritized different, often conflicting goals and constraints.\n\n- Project Manager: focused on cost, schedule and broad market strategy ( \u20ac25 target price, fast time\u2011to\u2011market, 50% gross margin). He wanted a simple TV\u2011only remote to launch quickly, minimal risky features (no speech recognition), and implementations that wouldn\u2019t delay production. He pressed for recognizable corporate branding and practical compromises (e.g., single\u2011curve instead of complex double\u2011curve).\n\n- Marketing: pushed aesthetic and product\u2011line ideas to drive sales\u2014fashionable \u201cfruity\u201d colours, removable face\u2011plates, LEDs, flashy styling, and headline features (parental profiles, voice control) to appeal to younger buyers and enable repeat purchases. Marketing favored differentiating features even if they added complexity or optional extras.\n\n- Industrial Designer: prioritized ergonomics, durability and manufacturability. He argued for shapes that feel good in the hand (single vs double curvature), rubber casing for grip/protection, simple reliable tech (infrared, battery/kinetic hybrid), and questioned feasibility/cost of flip\u2011up LCDs, backlit buttons, or complex parental\u2011control implementations. He worried about production costs, chip capabilities and physical constraints of molding and screens.\n\nThese different emphases produced clashes over parental control (marketing/PM wanted feature vs designer warning about development cost/complexity), shape and materials (fashion vs ergonomic/mold constraints), front buttons and LEDs (visual appeal vs usability and cost), wireless/technical options (practicality vs novelty), and overall style (trendiness vs manufacturable, inexpensive design). In short, conflicts arose from trade\u2011offs between market differentiation, user experience, technical feasibility, cost and schedule.",
    "Marketing structured the product evaluation as a short, team-scored checklist: they identified high\u2011level priorities, went through them together, scored each item on a 1\u20137 scale, and averaged the scores to produce the evaluation. The process was collaborative (group discussion and consensus votes), tied to the pricing constraint (target sell price \u20ac25 / production limit \u20ac12.50), and supported by a spreadsheet to compare component costs and trade\u2011offs (e.g., include/exclude LCD, speech recognition, docking station).\n\nSpecific criteria Marketing brought forward:\n- Look and feel / \u201cfanciness\u201d (visual appeal, ergonomics, interchangeable covers)\n- Innovation (new functions: speech recognition, LCD, retrieval/alarm, kinetic/solar power)\n- Ease of use / learnability (novice users, button layout, minimizing functions that confuse users)\n- Appeal to target demographic (primarily 20\u201340, but consideration of older users)\n- Fit with company motto / fashion trends (personalisation, colors/plates to follow trends)\n- Functionality usefulness (are included functions actually useful; not too many functions)\n- Cost / production feasibility (component costs, staying within \u20ac12.50 budget, profitability)\n- Recognisable corporate image (logo, colour scheme)\n- Usability concerns: findability (lost remote alarm/beeper), mitigation of RSI, ergonomics/grip\n- Technical feasibility (chip type, energy source, number/type of buttons, docking)\nThey used these criteria to compare prototype options and decide which features to keep or cut to meet budget and market goals.",
    "Transcription and recordings\n- Recordings: steady collection of meeting audio (tens of hours so far). Different counts were quoted at different meetings (roughly 30\u201360+ hours depending on date), with ongoing weekly collection (aim \u2248 a few meetings/week). Close\u2011talk headsets, PZM/distant mics and Sony wireless gear are in regular use; UW and other partners planning similar setups.\n- Transcription: a core team of transcribers is active (several hires, some attrition). A portion of the corpus is fully transcribed and being cleaned/channelized (spot checks show high inter\u2011transcriber agreement); other meetings are queued. Workstreams: spell\u2011checking, canonicalization of numbers/acronyms, tagging (VOC/NONVOC/GLOSS), channelization and boundary tightening.

This is largely an acoustic/recognition effort (multi\u2011band/MLP/VAD/Wiener work).\n- SPG (Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal) schema: part of the action\u2011schema XML design for dialog/planning. Status: a working schema outline exists (action\u2011schema block + SPG schemas as reusable role containers); binding/linking mechanisms between action instances and SPG role fillers are designed conceptually (references supported by existing APIs; XML examples promised next meeting). Current system does NOT enforce presence of SPG for an SPG\u2011type action (multiple schemas can coexist); richer intent\u2011oriented descriptions will be added in parallel. Integration work continues (XML examples, role bindings, and how intermediate perceptual categories feed NLU/action planner remain to be finalized).",
    "The Deputy Minister placed government amendments on the face of the Bill to address each area and explained why further, more prescriptive amendments were unnecessary.\n\nDuty to promote public awareness (Group 1)\n- She moved amendments 1 and 4 to require Welsh Ministers to provide information and run a sustained awareness campaign (she committed to a high\u2011intensity, six\u2011year programme and an expert stakeholder implementation group).\n- She rejected amendments 1A\u20131E as duplicative or overly prescriptive, arguing \u201cawareness\u201d already covers \u201cunderstanding,\u201d that specifying target groups, content or children\u2011specific duties on the face of the Bill would constrain planning, and that safeguarding/reporting duties already exist elsewhere.\n\nDuty to report on the effect of the legislation (Group 2)\n- She introduced amendments 2 and 5 to put a post\u2011implementation review duty on the face of the Bill and described a continuous, multifaceted evaluation (regular attitudinal surveys; a data\u2011collection task & finish group; and an implementation review).\n- She rejected several amendments as unnecessary or conflicting with operational priorities, but offered to discuss an interim reporting timetable and the report\u2019s scope with the committee ahead of Stage 3, and to update the explanatory memorandum and regulatory impact assessment.\n\nRegulation\u2011making / commencement powers (Group 3)\n- She restored limited transitory/transitional/saving powers on the face of the Bill (amendment 3) and proposed commencement the day after Royal Assent (amendment 6), removing a ministerial commencement Order.\n- She said broader regulation powers were not presently needed but would keep the need under review and agreed to discuss potential wider powers with Members before Stage 3.",
    "Long-term trends: ministers and officials stressed that raising standards requires whole\u2011system change rather than reliance on single indicators. They emphasised investment in professional learning (around 50% of the school\u2011standards fund), stronger self\u2011evaluation (the new National Evaluation and Improvement Resource), OECD external review, regional/middle\u2011tier clarity and multi\u2011agency work for struggling schools. Secondary schools remain the key concern (persistent underperformance and slow movement out of low categories). New accountability metrics (capped\u20119, third/third/third) and broader well\u2011being and curriculum\u2011aligned measures are being developed to give a fuller picture; international comparators (PISA/OECD) still inform long\u2011term aims. Closing the attainment gap and improving outcomes for more able pupils (Seren) are priorities.\n\nRole of Qualifications Wales (Philip Blaker): Qualifications Wales is the regulator of awarding bodies. Its core roles are approving qualification design and assessment, setting approval criteria and sample materials, prescribing and monitoring awarding methods to maintain standards (e.g. using comparable outcomes during specification change) and advising on timelines. Blaker flagged the need to plan reform timetables better to ensure system readiness, to define a bilingual core of resources, and to review regulatory arrangements (including the relationship between WJEC, publishers and potential new resource models).\n\nTimescales for the lack of exams: the Minister (on Qualifications Wales\u2019 advice) cancelled the summer series early so QW/WJEC can implement an alternative. They will use a modulated/comparable\u2011outcomes approach to award grades, prioritising year\u201111/13 gateway cohorts; urgent guidance and communications to centres are expected imminently, with an aim to mirror normal results timing in August where possible. For wider curriculum/qualification reform, stakeholders argue for 18 months\u20132 years between approval and teaching; Blaker noted a potential 2023 \u201cgo/no\u2011go\u201d decision for next major rollout, with first pupil assessment under the new curriculum not until mid\u20112020s (around 2027).",
    "Speakers repeatedly said the main challenge is uneven translation of good practice across Wales\u2014caused by inconsistent local leadership, variable regional consortia performance, patchy self\u2011evaluation, funding pressures and differing local contexts (rural, urban, Welsh\u2011language areas). Inspection and improvement powers exist but are used unevenly; some authorities act proactively while others delay intervention. That produces pockets of progress (often primary) alongside persistent secondary\u2011sector problems and repeat underperformers. Early\u2011warning data are improving (e.g., staff sickness, pupil movement) and a multi\u2011agency panel approach aims to intervene earlier, but evaluation, consistent data collection and sustainable follow\u2011through remain weak.\n\nImplications for childcare services\n- Uneven provision and workforce capacity: pilots show demand and supply vary widely; some areas need more places, others more staff or Welsh\u2011language capacity. A 10\u2011year workforce plan and capital investment are intended to address this, but scaling is required.  \n- Quality vs affordability tension: the \u00a34.50 hourly contribution is intended as a simple national rate, but questions remain about its adequacy in high\u2011cost areas and its impact on pay/quality. Providers may charge for extras (food, trips), risking extra costs for low\u2011income families.  \n- Administration and accessibility: pilots exposed heavy admin burdens for parents and councils; a centralised model (HMRC\u2011style) was discussed to simplify but raised bilingual/technical concerns.  \n- Targeting and equity: geographically targeted programmes (Flying Start) and a work\u2011linked childcare offer leave gaps for the most disadvantaged; better coordination and evaluation are needed to avoid widening inequalities.  \n\nOverall: stronger national coordination, improved data/evaluation, investment in workforce and tailored local implementation are needed to spread good practice without disadvantaging vulnerable families.",
    "The team reviewed which components are actually available and the resulting design constraints. Core electronics: the TA1835 IR-chip (standard TV remote encoder) is available and expected to be used; printed silicone PCB/button-contact technology is standard and can be sized to fit custom layouts; IR LED output and standby modes (auto-off backlighting after 5\u201310s) are feasible. Recharge options: conventional AA/AAA cells are cheapest but bulky; no off\u2011the\u2011shelf \u201crechargeable\u201d AA/AAA solution was available in their stock. Dynamo charging was rejected as impractical. Solar is technically possible but expensive, fragile, and ineffective under artificial indoor light. Kinetic (wristwatch-style energy-harvest, small cell) was favored as compact and plausible given low duty-cycle use, and the team tentatively selected this as primary power with watch-type cells. \n\nCase materials and manufacturing: the factory can supply plastic housings (allows curved shapes) and rubber covers/sleeves for a \u201cspongy\u201d feel; rubberized anti\u2011RSI buttons (stress\u2011ball type) are available for the button surfaces. Titanium is technically possible but limited to simple box shapes and cost\u2011prohibitive. The agreed solution: plastic shell with removable rubberized sleeves in vibrant (fruit/veg) colors.\n\nInterface design: a flip-top form with two circuit boards joined by wiring \u2014 a black\u2011and\u2011white LCD GUI on the top (touch/icons) and rubber physical buttons on the bottom for frequent controls (standard central volume/channel layout retained). Touch via bare PCB is technically possible; stylus option and a \u201cfind my remote\u201d beeper/voice locate were discussed but will require cost feasibility checks.",
    "The professors urged consolidation: adopt the single \u201cfinal\u201d piece of software with fixed default front-end choices (Wiener vs. spectral subtraction, FFT vs. mel-band processing) and stop continuously changing front-end options so the team can make stable progress. The neural net should be incorporated but its placement and latency matter: if run server\u2011side size is less constrained, but the net will likely benefit from limited future context (i.e., non\u2011causal frames). Performance should be prioritized over latency unless standards force tighter causal limits (they cited 130 ms vs 250 ms targets). The neural net is conceived primarily as a feature\u2011transform/enhancement stage (producing cleaned FFT-like outputs that feed subsequent feature processing), and the group should pick one consistent processing chain for the near term. VAD and noise\u2011estimation remain critical \u2014 better VADs gave large gains, frame\u2011dropping interactions with delta computation were noted, and Guenter\u2019s noise estimator sometimes degraded results; a compromise between initial\u2011frame and pause\u2011based estimates with some adaptive updating was recommended and needs evaluation.\n\nOn time series and reverberation, the professor highlighted ideas to handle long reverberation tails by trading spectral for temporal resolution (long windows, lower freq. resolution, modulation\u2011spectrum mean subtraction per Avenda\u00f1o) and suggested extending this to time\u2011varying room responses (use echo\u2011canceller taps between mics to measure variation). For modeling temporal structure, factorial HMMs and modulation\u2011spectrum features were proposed as promising directions.\n\nOn pronouncing zero: they decided to allow natural speech \u2014 both \u201cO\u201d and \u201czero\u201d occur; no rigid marking required, use ordinary pronunciations.",
    "The team reached a pragmatic, cost-conscious concept for the new remote: a fashion-forward, curved (single/double-curved discussed) rubber-over-hard-plastic case with removable, colorful covers (fruit/\u201cspongy\u201d grip trend). Energy: they favor a kinetic recharging system with battery backup/rechargeable battery\u2014kinetic as primary/backup to balance tech appeal and cost. Electronics: aim for a simple chip (advanced only if LCD/scroll wheel chosen) and pushbuttons as the default input to keep price down; a scroll wheel/LCD was discussed but not adopted as core features.\n\nUniversal remote approach: they decided to pursue a \u201cuniversal-like\u201d product targeted at 20\u201340 year-olds \u2014 able to control multiple devices (TV, VCR/DVD/recorder, stereo, set-top box) and switch between up to ~3 device types. It will be simpler and lower-cost than high-end universal remotes (no full-featured expensive LCD universal planned), with on-screen menus or simple remote menus for advanced functions.\n\nParental control: the group agreed parental-control should be included in the product (not an external add-on). They want simple, fast profile-based controls (parent vs. child profiles, PIN gating for restricted content, channel/time restrictions) and emphasized it must be quick to use\u2014simple numeric PINs and easy profile selection at purchase/setup.\n\nGames: considered non\u2011essential and seen as unnecessary complexity; games were deprioritized/omitted.\n\nVoice recognition: acknowledged market interest (esp. younger users) but concerns over cost, reliability and TV/noise environments. Consensus: not a primary feature; consider lightweight/basic voice commands only if low-cost, reliable implementations are available (otherwise defer).",
    "The committee focused on the pandemic\u2019s likely but not yet fully quantified impacts on children and young people\u2019s mental health, service access and safeguarding. Members raised worries about reduced referrals, limited visibility of vulnerable children, CAMHS capacity, and third\u2011sector funding; officials described weekly monitoring tools, maintained crisis services, and efforts to promote uptake of routine care (eg immunisations) and remote mental\u2011health support.\n\nOn the specific question of possible rises in suicide among young people, Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government has commissioned a rapid review. The delivery unit, working with the national advisory group (including Dr Ann John), is examining recent unexpected deaths to assess whether there has been a spike in suicides linked to pandemic restrictions. He expected the review\u2019s report before the end of the month and offered to share findings with the committee. He also emphasised that crisis mental\u2011health services for children remain designated as essential and continue to operate.\n\nOn long\u2011term and specialist perinatal care, Gething reported a roundtable with NSPCC and stressed the importance of consistent perinatal support across Wales. The Government is promoting phone/online provision where appropriate, but acknowledged challenges: planned increases in inpatient mother\u2011and\u2011baby capacity have been paused and timeframes are uncertain. He confirmed awareness that some women are reluctant to use mother\u2011and\u2011baby units during COVID\u201119 and warned against assuming reduced need; the Government remains committed to delivering specialist perinatal services but cannot yet give firm timelines.",
    "- When will implementation be finished?\n  No firm completion date was given for the strategic delivery group\u2019s work. Ministers and officials said the group is still agreeing a plan to support curriculum implementation and to clarify middle\u2011tier roles; the intention is to have implementation closely tied to the curriculum roll\u2011out (the national evaluation/improvement resource was being tested for system\u2011wide introduction in Sept 2020). The OECD report was due 23 March and expected to feed into next steps.\n\n- Risk of losing focus?\n  They did not think the group risked losing focus. The Minister said the group is clear about establishing roles and responsibilities and avoiding duplication; Steve Davies described the work as building \u201ccollective efficacy.\u201d They expect continued evolution but insisted they will keep the remit tight.\n\n- Making harder improvements\n  All agreed harder improvements are necessary and acknowledged they are challenging. For underperforming (especially secondary) schools they want a different, more intensive approach: multi\u2011agency panels (LA, regional consortia, Estyn, WG), focus on fundamentals (leadership, teaching), capacity building for schools and governors, and sustainable 6/12/18\u2011month plans rather than quick fixes. They accept broader, tougher measures are harder to compare over time but are justified to drive meaningful, sustainable change.\n\n- PRU networking and transition arrangements\n  PRU networking has strengthened: more professional learning, joint visits and sharing of expertise between PRUs and schools. Transition back to mainstream is managed (part\u2011time timetables, team\u2011around\u2011the\u2011family support, tapered post\u2011reintegration support) but is harder at Key Stage 4; capacity, transport (rural areas) and quality\u2011assurance of commissioned/home tuition remain concerns.",
    "They treated infra\u2011red as the default, essential transmission method and focused on making it robust and reliable. Key technical concerns were: a clear, non\u2011scattered IR signal so users don\u2019t have to wave the remote around; a well\u2011designed chip to encode signals cleanly; and a dependable energy source (long battery life or a charging/cradle option) because battery performance affects IR reliability. In short, IR functionality was seen as critical to usability and should be prioritized in component quality (chip, IR emitter) and power design.\n\nOn disposable income, the group noted survey findings that younger users are more interested in advanced features (voice recognition) but that purchasing power varies by sub\u2011age. They discussed 15\u201325 being most enthusiastic about voice tech, while 25\u201335 were identified as having greater disposable income (fewer mortgages, cars, commitments) and thus more likely to pay for a stylish/upgraded remote. Project constraints tempered optimism: target retail price (~\u20ac25) and an implied production cost ceiling (~\u20ac12.50) mean advanced features may be unaffordable. Consequently they leaned toward targeting a 15\u201335 audience (or defining targets by lifestyle: fashion + simplicity) while being cautious about adding costly features unless justified by market willingness-to-pay and feasibility.",
    "They concluded that free school meal (FSM) eligibility is an imperfect but still the best practical proxy for pupil need at present. Ministers and officials accept its limitations (single annual snapshot, changes from universal credit rollout) and are actively exploring alternatives (longer\u2011term \u201cEver\u201d style measures or an \u201cEver\u20112\u201d approach) while noting major cost and data/privacy constraints. They stress that individual interventions should be targeted at FSM pupils, while universal whole\u2011school approaches may be funded from PDG only if they demonstrably have a disproportionate positive effect on FSM pupils.\n\nOn attendance and engagement the group judged PDG has had a positive but uneven impact. Estyn evidence shows overall attendance improvements since inspections began, and witnesses gave concrete school\u2011level examples where PDG funded effective interventions (walking buses/outreach, school nurses/counsellors, family work, nurture groups) that increased attendance and kept vulnerable pupils engaged. They also noted persistent gaps (eg, only c.35% of FSM pupils had 95%+ attendance at Level 4 vs 60% non\u2011FSM) and greater difficulty in changing behaviour for older pupils. The group emphasised need for clearer evidence of impact, stronger tracking, use of evidence\u2011based interventions (eg Sutton Trust toolkit), and the new regional PDG advisers to improve targeting, evaluation and consistency across schools.",
    "On support vector machines (SVMs) the professor was cautiously positive. He described SVMs as \u201csuccinct\u201d and likened them to a condensed nearest\u2011neighbor approach: instead of retaining all examples you keep a few critical support vectors, which can give a reduced\u2011parameter representation and make learning easier when data are limited. He contrasted that with neural nets or Gaussian mixtures, which are \u201cbrute\u2011force\u201d and require many parameters and lots of data to learn well. He acknowledged SVMs\u2019 purported advantage with modest training data but noted he wasn\u2019t aware of careful large\u2011scale comparisons showing clear wins. He also recalled that groups (e.g., Mississippi State) had applied SVMs to speech recognition by converting SVM distances to probabilities (sigmoid/softmax) and got reasonable but not \u201cearth\u2011shattering\u201d results in early work \u2014 interesting and worth trying, but not definitively superior on big tasks.\n\nOn speech rate algorithms: the provided meeting transcripts contain no discussion or explicit comments from the professor about speech\u2011rate algorithms for speech recognition. If you want his view on that topic, I can summarize likely considerations (e.g., tempo normalization, dynamic time\u2011warping, feature\u2011rate adaptations) or extract similar opinions from related topics in the transcripts.",
    "The professor views echoes and reverberation as practical artifacts that can significantly distort acoustic modeling and alignment, and he advocates pragmatic, data-driven mitigation. He notes that long-window mean\u2011subtraction or averaging (even over many seconds) can introduce echo\u2011 or pre\u2011echo\u2011like components\u2014particularly audible in low\u2011energy regions\u2014and these can cause spurious insertions and misalignments in recognizers. Reverberation effects are strongest in low\u2011energy segments, so high\u2011pass filtering or deliberately dropping/attenuating very low\u2011energy frames (or using an energy\u2011aware VAD) can reduce their impact. He endorses approaches like spectral subtraction/Wiener filtering with careful smoothing and SNR floors to avoid musical noise, and he stresses inspecting insertion/deletion patterns to detect scale/range mismatches introduced by different front\u2011end features (MSG vs. PLP/mel). He also recommends simple numerical fixes (rooting, log\u2011domain division, scaling) to bring feature ranges into sensible operating ranges rather than only adjusting back\u2011end penalties.\n\nOn acoustic events, the professor distinguishes bottom\u2011up measurable \u201cevents\u201d from top\u2011down linguistic features and is positive about developing robust, data\u2011driven event detectors inspired by auditory neuroscience. He encourages building probabilistic event models, combining detectors, and feeding their outputs into recognizers to test robustness across clean and noisy conditions. He recommends engaging auditory/signal\u2011processing experts and evaluating whether front\u2011end event detectors or simple back\u2011end scaling yield the better, more stable solution.",
    "The team agreed on a simple, hand-held, TV-only user interface focused on ease of use and cost-effectiveness for the 15\u201335 target. They decided to favor conventional push-button technology (the company\u2019s strength) over expensive touch/LCD remotes. Core UI elements: a small, ergonomic, double-curved handset with a prominent four-way directional control (up/down/left/right) and an enter/select button in the center; channel and volume controls (side-mounted scroll or side buttons that must be depressed to avoid accidental changes); large, clearly labeled keys; and a full numeric keypad included for channel entry. To keep costs down, any detailed program/menu display will appear on the TV screen rather than on an onboard LCD.\n\nAdvanced features were discussed but not integrated: voice recognition was considered promising but excluded for now due to cost/complexity; a locator (beeper/sonic find function) was favored over full voice control. Lighting (LED illumination/glow-in-the-dark) and lighted buttons are acceptable cosmetic extras if budget allows. Energy: kinetic power (motion-charging) is the preferred experimental option if feasible; otherwise small batteries (AAA or a single lithium) with a possible recharge cradle. Materials: base plastic housing with the option of removable rubber/latex covers (spongy feel) to support trend-based customization while reserving a logo window. Next steps: UI and industrial designers to prototype a single, cost-targeted concept (modelling clay prototype) and finalize the exact button set.",
    "The project manager consistently prioritized staying within budget, so his views were pragmatic and compromise-driven.\n\nPlastic material: he favored a cheap plastic, solid-case solution because it materially reduced cost (\u201cplastic\u2026incurs no cost\u201d), and he explicitly said they might have to \u201cgo with plastic and some kind of solid design\u201d to meet the price target. He acknowledged rubber/bio\u2011morphic grips were preferable ergonomically but noted rubber added cost (about \u20ac2/unit) and had been largely sacrificed.\n\nChangeable cover: he liked the idea of changeable covers as a way to offer variety and after\u2011sales revenue\u2014suggesting a basic plastic body that customers could \u201cfancy up\u201d with exchangeable covers or buy covers in store. He did flag organizational and supply\u2011chain complications for superiors, but supported covers as a paid extra rather than standard.\n\nColor: he was open to bright \u201cfruity\u201d colours to appeal to a younger target and to make the remote easier to find, though earlier default references included black/grey. Ultimately he leaned toward offering flashy colours as standard to attract youth, with more traditional/sophisticated finishes (wood/titanium/metallic) available as premium extras.\n\nShape: he pushed for a single\u2011curve, solid form as the cost/feasibility compromise (double\u2011curved or articulated designs cost more). He wanted to retain ergonomic considerations\u2014noting LCD placement and handedness trade\u2011offs\u2014and supported simple mechanical solutions (e.g., a slightly ovoid joystick that can be rotated) to address left/right usability without costly articulation.",
    "They focused on fixing the system by selecting a small set of architectures to stabilize and evaluate, and on clarifying how those compare to the baseline. Key technical points:\n- Architectures: \u201ccombo\u201d (two MLP streams: raw features and low-pass filtered features combined, with KLT on some paths), a variant without low-pass filtering (two streams), a variant without KLT on the left path, and a proposed fourth with a single KLT. The yellowed rows (combo and the non\u2011low\u2011pass two\u2011stream) are the lead candidates.\n- Low\u2011pass filtered cepstral features give modest gains in some conditions. Removing or adding KLT and silence dimensions (SIL) changes results; one non\u2011KLT variant does better on highly mismatched Italian.\n- Silence detection helps but current handset/server latency prevents adding a server\u2011side silence detector; teams are exploring compromise delays.\n- Baseline comparisons: OGI2 is baseline; results vary across datasets. They must combine dataset scores with the official weighting (e.g., 40/60 or 40/35/25) and include TI\u2011digits once available.\n- Evaluation process: get per\u2011set counts, run significance tests, and compute the weighted metric. Development data allows multiple tries; final submission deadline effectively Tuesday.\n- Experiments and fixes: run variance/weighting studies (deweighting specific cepstral dimensions, lifters, exponent scaling), test removing C1 (found to be low\u2011utility), and use extra compute (server farm) for large sweeps.\nPlan: start training as soon as new data arrives, begin write\u2011up immediately, and focus on the three (plus optional fourth) architectures for final evaluation.",
    "Legislation: In the Wales session, officials flagged legislation (e.g., restricting price promotions, banning energy drinks, planning controls on hot\u2011food takeaways) as possible tools but stressed consultation, evaluation and tight legislative timetables; debate over targets for childhood obesity and use of sugar\u2011tax consequentials (\u00a356m over two years) and whether to hypothecate funds. In Canada, ministers discussed fast\u2011moving pandemic measures and separate planned firearms legislation (ban/buyback for military\u2011style rifles) and conditions on corporate aid (executive pay/tax behaviour).\n\nSports infrastructural construction: Witnesses urged designing new schools and public buildings with changing rooms, toilets and community\u2011accessible sports facilities, using health impact assessment and local leadership. Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales are coordinating to join up school, community and physical\u2011activity programmes; concerns about staffing, teacher training and falling activity (especially among girls) were raised.\n\nGovernment support for energy resources and tourism: Canadian ministers outlined targeted liquidity and loan facilities for oil and gas (including BCAP and large\u2011employer financing), provincial/federal coordination, ACOA funding for Atlantic tourism, and ad hoc support measures for ferries and processors. The EDC\u2019s $500m support for Coastal GasLink drew criticism as contradictory to green transition aims.\n\nFunding in green economy and small business support: Recovery was framed as an opportunity to fast\u2011track a green economy, but officials faced calls to attach conditions to corporate aid. Small businesses were supported via wage subsidies, rent relief schemes and targeted funds (including $350m for charities); gaps remain where landlords/unique enterprise structures impede access and PPE procurement challenges persist.\n\nImpact of Covid\u201119: Fishing and seafood markets collapsed (lobster exports to Asia down as much as 95%); harvesters and family\u2011run fish enterprises struggled to access relief. Tourism and ferry services faced severe revenue loss and uncertainty. Oil and gas endured simultaneous demand collapse and price\u2011war shocks, prompting urgent liquidity interventions and concerns about jobs, Indigenous contractors and sector viability.",
    "The team agreed the remote should remain simple: a single\u2011function TV controller with only core buttons (power, channel up/down, volume, mute, zap) and grouped/hidden menus for rarely used features (no full DVD/VCR programming). They stressed fewer functions for usability and market appeal.\n\nThey decided to move away from the standard rectangular slab toward a more organic, ergonomic shape inspired by fruit/vegetable forms. The group debated double\u2011curved vs single\u2011curved designs: double\u2011curved felt very ergonomic but constrains some hardware choices (e.g., scroll\u2011wheels), while a single\u2011curved/curved profile was seen as a practical compromise that supports side volume controls and thumb reach. Ultimately the team favored a curved, hand\u2011friendly form rather than a straight box.\n\nPersonalization (interchangeable facings/casings with fruit or themed graphics) was proposed and supported in principle. Marketing liked replaceable covers to drive accessory sales; manufacturing cautioned about printing, supplier capability and cost. The team judged personalization feasible but flagged further feasibility and cost research (printing, moulds, supplier limits) before committing.\n\nNovel shapes (banana, broccoli, literal fruit) were discussed enthusiastically but treated cautiously: seen as good for advertising/gimmick value but potentially gimmicky or uncomfortable. The final casing decision: a colourful, spongy rubber/plastic curved housing\u2014an organic ergonomic shape inspired by fruit (not literal novelty items), with the option to explore removable/alternative facia subject to supplier and cost validation.",
    "The marketing team proposed lemon/lime colours to make the product a fashion-led, visible and coherent \u201clook-and-feel\u201d statement rather than just a functional electronic. Their research flagged a current European fashion/home-decor trend toward fruit-and-vegetable motifs and \u201cvibrant natural colours,\u201d and marketing wanted the remote to tap that trend (they even noted seeing lemon/lime palettes on many websites). Choosing lemon/lime also ties into the company\u2019s corporate yellow and would make the device easier to find (dark, brick-like remotes get lost in sofas). \n\nStrategically, bright citrus hues help position the remote as \u201cfancy\u201d and distinctive\u2014matching the priority consumers give to style and novelty over pure utility\u2014and differentiate it from competitors still using last year\u2019s hard, glossy look. Marketing emphasized using colour as a unifying theme across shape, material (softer, spongy/rubbery textures), lighting/backlighting and optional covers, rather than literally shaping the product like a fruit. In short: lemon/lime aligns the product with current fashion trends, increases visibility and brand coherence, and supports the desired positioning as a trendy, consumer-identifiable piece of home tech.",
    "The team concluded that the proposed style and feature set meets the new project requirements and most market-driven criteria, but does not fully resolve repetitive strain injury (RSI) concerns. Key points:\n\n- Style and form: a distinctive, fashionable flip-open (\u201cshell\u201d) handset with customizable facias, a black\u2011and\u2011white LCD touch panel on the top half and essential rubberized buttons on the bottom. Corporate branding and multiple finishes were recommended to improve findability and appeal.\n\n- Market research alignment: findings strongly support a simpler, stylish remote \u2014 users dislike current clunky controls, only use ~10% of buttons, and 80% would pay more for better design. Locating aids (beeper/bleeper) and visible design to reduce loss were prioritized. Younger users favor LCD and speech features; older users prefer simplicity.\n\n- Adjustments for new requirements: the product is scoped to TV (\u00b1video) only, no teletext. Complexity and programming functions are reduced (use Videoplus numeric entry instead of date/time programming). Rechargeable/kinetic power was proposed; voice recognition was deferred from the base model (kept as a premium option) due to cost and budget constraints.\n\n- RSI minimization: mitigations (ergonomic \u201cbanana\u201d curvature, larger spongy rubber buttons, touch surface, flip-top layout) were incorporated, but the team rated RSI reduction only modestly effective. They judged current technology and budget unlikely to eliminate RSI and recommended further study and possible future premium solutions (e.g., full voice control or larger arm-movement interfaces).\n\nDecision: proceed to prototype and market testing\u2014meets most criteria\u2014while flagging RSI as an unresolved issue for future development.",
    "Assessments on the future of institutions\n- Two threads: domestic political institutions and higher-education institutions. MPs debated Parliament\u2019s role, oversight and the need for transparency (Auditor General funding, emergency spending scrutiny). In Wales, the Higher Education Funding Council warned Brexit, demographic shifts and funding shortfalls threaten university sustainability: EU student applications are down (c.\u20118% EU, c.\u20119% non\u2011EU in Wales by UCAS), research income and capital investment are constrained, and institutions are stress\u2011testing scenarios. Implementation of the Diamond funding recommendations and replacement research funding (post\u2011EU/Horizon) are critical to institutional resilience; Erasmus continuity and S\u00ear Cymru investments matter for research networks.\n\nDiscussions on women\u2019s issues\n- Repeated calls to address violence and systemic harms: the murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls inquiry, a Women, Peace and Security progress report, and demands for action on racialized women\u2019s safety. Pandemic\u2011era impacts on women were highlighted: disproportionate job losses, added caregiving duties, gaps in EI/CERB design, and criticism that GBA+ analysis was insufficient. Several MPs urged binding federal action on affordable, quality child care and protections for pregnant/parenting workers.\n\nCommittee\u2019s statements on housing\n- Concerns about long\u2011term care and assisted\u2011living failures (military support extended in Quebec). Housing-specific debate centered on the Canada Housing Benefit (announced 2017, ~$4B component) and the national housing strategy (~$55B): only limited provincial uptake so far, calls to adopt non\u2011profit housing association principles, expedite rent/housing supports, and prioritize affordable\u2011housing stimulus (including purchases of hotels to house people experiencing homelessness).\n\nMembers\u2019 discussions (themes)\n- Broad, cross\u2011cutting concerns: systemic racism and police reform; data collection by race; PPE procurement controversies (suppliers, Deloitte, stolen shipments); firearms prohibition and buyback plans; Huawei/5G security questions; CERB, wage subsidy and program eligibility gaps affecting sole proprietors, seasonal/tourism and agriculture sectors; rural broadband; veterans\u2019 benefit backlogs; parole/victim participation; and numerous constituency petitions and local initiatives.",
    "They discussed how to collect, transcribe and use the \u201cmeeting digits\u201d recordings as training/test material and how that data compares to TI\u2011digits and Aurora. Key decisions and points:\n\n- Current status: most digit forms are nearly complete; some entries blank when people didn\u2019t attend. grad f has scripts/XWaves that present the target digit string, let you mark the region, and write a formatted file. grad f will enter the top\u2011of\u2011form metadata (name, time, date) and hand files to Jane and the transcribers for actual extraction; transcribers can do extraction too.\n\n- Transcriber work: consensus that having transcribers extract digits is acceptable (fits skills, gives variety and double\u2011checks). Typing metadata is optional\u2014tradeoff with time spent on word transcription.\n\n- Evaluation / recognition plans: use a TI\u2011digits style test set (randomized file used locally) to train recognizers and then test on meeting data and distant mics. They expect near\u2011mic meeting digits to perform worse than TI (TI best systems 0.25\u20130.8% error; their meeting digits ~3\u20134% near\u2011mic; Aurora noisy tasks ~5% per digit). Plan to force\u2011align post\u2011processed, channelized transcripts and produce ~12 hours of aligned/recognized data within weeks.\n\n- Issues discussed: prosody/grouping in read digits differs from conversational speech (may affect articulatory feature modeling), pronunciation variants (\u201cO\u201d vs \u201czero\u201d), and whether to annotate articulatory/gestural features (small pilot comparing digits vs conversational speech recommended). Also work on channel\u2011specific VAD/presegmentation and tighter timebands to improve alignment.",
    "Reasons for recommending speech recognition\n- Market demand and product differentiation: Marketing reported strong demand from 15\u201335 year\u2011olds (75\u201390% willing to pay extra), so speech recognition is a visible, trendy feature that can justify a higher price and strengthen corporate image.\n- Usability and simplification: The user\u2011interface team argued speech lets you reduce button clutter, avoid complex button sequences, speed common tasks (volume, channel, favorites) and improve accessibility for users who struggle with buttons.\n- Technical feasibility with caveats: The industrial designer agreed it\u2019s feasible (especially with one\u2011word commands and user training) but warned it increases chip complexity, power and costing considerations and affects mechanical design.\n\nBenefits by stakeholder\n- Marketing: A clear selling point and competitive differentiator; supports a \u201cfancy/trendy\u201d product position, can create market buzz, and allows a higher retail price or niche positioning.\n- Industrial designer: Enables new interaction modalities (voice commands, oral confirmation, locator beeps); but requires accommodating a microphone, speaker, possibly larger/advanced electronics or recharge/cradle solutions \u2014 trade\u2011offs between robustness, materials and cost.\n- User Interface / User\u2011interface designer: Improves user experience by reducing button overload, making infrequently used functions easier, supporting favorites/programming by voice, and providing confirmation feedback. They stress implementation must handle ambient TV audio to avoid false activations (recommend one\u2011word commands, press\u2011to\u2011talk/mode switch, robust filtering, or moving recognition to the TV).\nOverall, speech recognition is recommended for market and UX reasons but must be engineered to control cost, avoid false triggers, and fit the product\u2019s power and form\u2011factor constraints.",
    "- Work of consortia and attitudes/opinions: witnesses agreed consortia play a key middle\u2011tier role but performance and capacity vary regionally. Meilyr Rowlands and others welcomed improved knowledge and use of school\u2011level intelligence but warned consortia have struggled to recruit secondary specialists and to influence teaching and learning in some secondary schools. Concerns were raised that some local authorities are too small to deliver all improvement services alone and that destabilisation (for example, a member authority withdrawing) risks the national model. ERW (south\u2011west/mid Wales) was singled out as troubled (leadership instability, budget and governance issues) and Estyn planned link visits to probe mitigation.\n\n- Jassa Scott (Estyn): she said consortia have generally improved since earlier monitoring (2017), are better at using school\u2011level knowledge to support/challenge (notably on literacy/numeracy), but are weaker on digital competence and on sustained impact in secondary schools where specialist capacity is thin. She stressed Estyn has no dedicated statutory inspection power for consortia (they are examined through local authority inspections) and described Estyn\u2019s forthcoming thematic work on how each consortia supports curriculum reform.\n\n- Auditor General (Canada): Parliamentary debate showed disagreement over resourcing. The Prime Minister/Finance Minister noted funding increases (citing earlier 2018\u201119 boosts, 38 FTE); opposition speakers argued the Auditor General still lacks resources to audit the massive COVID\u2011era spending.\n\n- Bill Blair on Pearson firearms seizure and social stability: Blair condemned smuggling and large seizures, stressed border/enforcement work to keep guns out of Canada and said stronger gun laws and targeted measures against smuggled weapons are required. He framed combined approaches\u2014tighter controls, enforcement against smugglers and community investment\u2014as necessary to protect public safety and social stability.\n\n- Political background and aim of the group: the discussion sits in the context of Welsh education reform (national curriculum change) and the newly emphasised \u201cmiddle tier\u201d (regional consortia, local authorities, Estyn, Welsh Government). A strategic delivery group (chaired by Professor Dylan Jones) was formed to bring the key organisations together to clarify roles, co\u2011construct reform implementation, reduce duplication, and ensure consistent, sustainable school\u2011improvement support across regions.",
    "The team converged on a core set of functional goals and several new feature ideas. They realized early that \u201closing the remote\u201d is a major user pain point and explored a lost\u2011and\u2011found/homing function: proposals included a beep or blinking light, responding to clapping or voice, a darkness/light sensor that automatically signals when buried under objects, and a charger/base that can ping the remote (phone\u2011finder style). They noted clap/voice triggers may be unreliable and favored a more specific sensor-triggered signal or a base-assisted homing solution while balancing cost concerns.\n\nDuring project evaluation the group recommended simplifying and prioritizing functions: keep essential controls (power, channel up/down, volume, mute, numeric keys, a modest set of media buttons) and pare away rarely used buttons. Usability improvements included larger, raised, soft rubber buttons, an ergonomic biomorphic shape, prominent on/off, color/logo integration, a fluorescent green LED/menu button for status and feedback, and an inset menu area for less\u2011used settings (audio, brightness, subtitles). Technical improvements: a smart chip for universal multi\u2011device control (TV, DVD, stereo, HVAC), IR emitter plus indicator LED, and consideration of rechargeable batteries vs. disposables. Budget constraints and manufacturability were recurring concerns.\n\nNew functions brainstormed beyond basics: speech recognition for spoken channel/command control (flagged as a key marketing differentiator), a device\u2011selection switch, a \u201cswap/previous channel\u201d button, homing/charger integration, and accessibility-targeted features for older or disabled users. They agreed to prototype and user-test tradeoffs between added features and cost.",
    "During the finance discussion the team agreed the case would be a special rubber colour and initially talked about multiple special colours for the product: Marketing pushed for distinctive, \u201cfruity\u201d colourways (at least two, Marketing suggested three) so there could be a bright, fashion-focused option and a more toned-down corporate option. There was some confusion about whether the buttons themselves would be in special colours (industrial design said the buttons could be up to three colours), but to simplify production and cut costs the project manager and industrial designer later proposed making all the buttons a single colour.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied because that change undercut the visual and brand strategy it had been pushing. Marketing wanted multi\u2011coloured buttons to (a) reinforce the product\u2019s \u201cfruity\u201d / fashionable identity, (b) improve visibility so the remote is harder to lose, and (c) allow different consumer variants (trendy vs. conservative). The button-simplification felt like a loss of creativity and differentiation to Marketing, and it appeared to be a cost-driven trade-off made without fully addressing marketing concerns. The team\u2019s discussion about costs (a unit cost rise mentioned from \u20ac13 to \u20ac15) also heightened Marketing\u2019s frustration that aesthetic/positioning choices were being trimmed to meet price targets.",
    "Welsh dimension\n- Committee asked for a directory of resources to support the \u201cWelsh dimension.\u201d Ministers confirmed a separate programme is in place to identify and publish needed resources and are coordinating with Qualifications Wales to avoid past resource shortfalls.  \n- The Welsh dimension should be broad and embedded across learning areas (e.g. Welsh contributions in STEM), not confined to a single subject.  \n- Language progression must be contextualised: different expected rates of progression in Welsh for Welsh\u2011medium and English\u2011medium settings, with statutory progression steps on a single continuum adapted to context.\n\nEmployers\u2019 understanding of the Welsh baccalaureate\n- Witnesses (ColegauCymru, colleges, employers) agreed many employers do not clearly understand the Welsh bac; the title and what it contains are often unclear. Larger/engaged employers may understand and value it, but most are focused on core professional qualifications.  \n- Colleges reported the Welsh bac has become rigorous and bureaucratic, can duplicate other programmes, and is harder to sustain at levels 1\u20132 because of GCSE resits. Universities and employers vary in how they recognise it.  \n- Suggested remedies: review the qualification with employers genuinely involved (to build ownership), better contextualisation within vocational subjects, stronger, structured employer\u2013education partnerships (internships, mentoring, Career Ready, WorldSkills) rather than tokenistic visits.\n\nBenefits of an independent inspectorate in Wales\n- Estyn\u2019s independence provides public assurance, external verification of schools\u2019 self\u2011evaluation and development plans, and a national arbiter for accountability distinct from classroom assessment.  \n- Estyn\u2019s use of nominee and peer inspectors is a notable strength; external reviews (e.g. Donaldson) are appropriate to ensure Estyn adapts to wide curriculum reform.  \n- Overall, an independent body can hold the system to account, support consistent standards, identify weaknesses and promote improvement while helping balance accountability with formative assessment.",
    "They were ambivalent about the convenience of presentation materials. Physical tools (pens, whiteboard) were generally seen as useful\u2014new pens that \u201cshow up\u201d were appreciated and the whiteboard was the default for group discussion\u2014though markers had failed previously. Microphones worked okay when seated but were clumsy when people moved to the board. Digital tools provoked more criticism: several members disliked PowerPoint (called \u201cstupid\u201d or awkward), one preferred older tools (WordPerfect/Unix), and others found slide work tedious. Access disparity was a problem\u2014the project manager couldn\u2019t reach online resources others used, which made them feel excluded. Recording/archival tech (video/transcripts) was viewed skeptically; some felt watching long recordings was unnecessary when a short summary would suffice. At the same time, a couple found presentation materials helpful depending on role. Overall the group judged in-person, low-tech methods (clear whiteboard notes, functioning pens, concise handouts) as more convenient for collaboration; digital slides, recordings and clumsy mics added friction. Suggested improvements: ensure markers and pens work, share digital resources accessibly before meetings, keep slide decks short or replace with summaries, avoid lengthy video reviews, and refine mic setup for board work.",
    "They rejected adding an LCD because it added complexity, cost and limited practical benefit. Key reasons cited:\n\n- Cost and hardware: an LCD would force an \u201cadvanced\u201d chip (vs. simple/regular chips for pushbuttons/scroll wheels), increasing component and manufacturing cost. The team wanted to avoid unnecessary high-tech features to keep price down.\n\n- Power and battery impact: an LCD (and required backlighting) consumes more power, creating battery-life problems unless they used larger or rechargeable batteries. That conflicted with their desire for long-life/low-maintenance power (kinetic/standard battery hybrid).\n\n- Usability/readability limits: any display on a small remote would be quite small and hard to read while sitting across the room. Back-and-forth glances between an LCD on the remote and the TV were judged less usable than a simple button interface or an on-screen TV menu.\n\n- Limited information flow: the remote\u2019s communication is largely one-way (remote \u2192 TV), so the remote couldn\u2019t easily show real-time TV listings or feedback from the set without extra complexity.\n\n- Design priorities: market research prioritized \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d and simplicity. The team felt visual/material styling (curves, rubber, colours, lighting effects) would deliver fashionably without the cost/complexity of an LCD.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, they chose to omit an LCD and focus resources on simpler buttons, possible scroll/jog controls, battery strategy and the case/look.",
    "Self-introduction\nTeam members introduced themselves and roles: Heather (Project Manager), Andrew (Marketing), Craig (User Interface), an Industrial Designer and others. They did a quick team-building whiteboard exercise (favorite animals) to practice tools and note-taking.\n\nProject introduction\nGoal: design a marketable, trendy TV remote (target retail \u20ac25, production target \u20ac12.50). Constraints: avoid advanced features like speech recognition; discuss LCD inclusion (debated), docking station with locator/antenna \u201cleaves,\u201d rechargeable batteries (solar questioned), and a playful \u201cbanana\u201d/fruit aesthetic aimed at younger trendsetters.\n\nBrainstorming process\nIdea generation combined individual homework and group meetings. Methods: sketching, Play\u2011Doh prototyping, whiteboard/digital-pen work and PowerPoint. Key concepts: ergonomic banana shape, scroll wheels for volume/channel, a \u201cturbo\u201d button doubling as power/confirm, teletext navigation via scroll wheels, limited visible buttons to reduce cost, docking station for charging and locator function, color variations and covers. They noted missing user focus groups and suggested street testing with target users.\n\nProject evaluation\nThey used a 1\u20137 criteria scale (fanciness, functionality, usability, cost, recognizability) and aggregated subjective scores (wide variance). Major concerns: production cost overruns, trade-offs (LCD + advanced chip vs. cost), suitability for older users, and market positioning. Consensus: remove or simplify expensive parts (LCD/advanced chip) to hit cost target; docking station could justify higher retail price.\n\nProject process\nWorkflow: structured roles, divided tasks, meetings for review. Tools: digital pens, shared folders, PowerPoint; strengths: clear task structure; weaknesses: poor between-meeting collaboration, too\u2011rigid constraints, insufficient early physical prototyping and user testing. Next steps: refine design, build prototype, conduct target-market feedback.",
    "They liked the idea but were cautious. The project manager and some others thought a rechargeable option was attractive: it would eliminate the \u201cbattery empty\u201d annoyance, could be implemented as rechargeable Penlite cells or a docking/base station (possibly sitting by the TV) and might not add much cost if produced offshore. Marketing felt customers would pay for \u201ccomfort\u201d and saw the docking bay as a strong, visible value-add.\n\nCounterpoints focused on cost, complexity and practicality. The industrial designer warned remotes already last years on two batteries and that adding recharge hardware (and the extra electronics/transistors) would increase size and cost; a docking station could be expensive. The user-interface lead worried people would forget to recharge and want to use ordinary batteries immediately, so any solution should accept both rechargeable and standard cells. They also flagged the extra requirement of a battery in the base or mains connection for the dock. Several times the team said they needed finance/production data before committing.\n\nOutcome: the team agreed to research feasibility and costs (rechargeable cells vs. docking station, space implications, production cost targets), but treated recharge as a lower-priority/optional enhancement. The project manager explicitly noted rechargeable functionality might be the first thing to cut if it violated the cost target, so it remained a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d pending cost/technical validation.",
    "They agreed to reduce microphone nonuniformity by standardizing on close\u2011talking head\u2011mounted mics rather than continuing to use heterogeneous lapels. Rationale: lapels produce lower quality and inconsistent signals that hurt transcription, forced alignment and prosody work. Concrete steps/decisions:\n\n- Trial first: buy one candidate head\u2011mounted headset (vendor\u2011recommended Crown model) to test comfort and audio quality before committing to multiples. If people prefer it, they will order more identical units (one suggestion was \u201ca half dozen\u201d of the chosen mike).\n- Keep some extra mics around as backups; consider one or more handheld/wireless pass\u2011around units for overflow speakers (acknowledging overlap limitations).\n- Technical constraints noted: receiver/channel limits, proprietary Sony connector (options: buy pigtail jack or have custom wiring done), and card/board channel limits in the recorder. They will verify receiver compatibility and channel capacity before expanding.\n- Short\u2011term workaround: record signals separately and time\u2011align to the meeting start (or mix to a primary channel) to preserve flexibility; multi\u2011channel arrays were discussed but deferred\u2014arrays are interesting for others (NIST) but not needed for their primary impromptu meeting goals.\n- Action: do a field trip to try headsets in person, test one unit in the room, then purchase matching units if satisfactory.",
    "Kirsty Williams AM\n- Reopening/safety: Any move to reopen will be phased and based on CMO/CSO advice. Decisions will prioritise the physical and emotional well\u2011being of pupils and staff, sit within the wider pandemic response, be clearly communicated to build confidence, identify which pupil groups should return first, and consider operational issues (workforce, social distancing in classrooms and transport, avoiding gatherings at gates).\n- Ensuring safety in hubs: Welsh Government has published safe\u2011working guidance for local authorities; hubs should report incidents and staff/families with any COVID symptoms (however mild) should be tested. Testing, tracing and quarantine are critical building blocks for any next phase.\n- Support for emotional/mental health: Additional funding is being made available to local authorities to ramp up services (telephone/video counselling, wider therapeutic offers, and professional development for counsellors). Schools/local authorities are expected to keep in regular contact, carry out risk assessments for vulnerable children, and use specialist hubs where appropriate.\n- Studying from home: Emphasis on Hwb as the national continuity platform, guidance to parents (Stay Learning), and measures to tackle digital disadvantage \u2014 repurposing school devices, deploying software to older kit, buying Mi\u2011Fi and working with LAs to identify and reach non\u2011engaging pupils. She urged parents not to be too hard on themselves and to contact schools for support.\n\nMeilyr Rowlands (Estyn)\n- Challenges in secondary schools: Secondary sector faces greater challenges than primary \u2014 deficits, leadership and recruitment pressures, stagnant quality of teaching, and a higher proportion of schools causing concern or in special measures. Curriculum reform will take longer in secondary and requires time, professional learning and multi\u2011agency targeted support for weaker schools.\n- Emotional/mental health: Estyn evidence shows pupils\u2019 confidence in school support falls sharply by key stage 4 (around half). Secondary schools find it harder to provide the consistent, trusted adult and whole\u2011school tracking/support; stronger pastoral staffing and community\u2011focused approaches are needed.",
    "The Industrial Designer was cautiously enthusiastic about a spherical (ball) remote but raised multiple practical concerns and concrete suggestions about design, style and functions. He liked the trendiness of a ball form but warned it would roll\u2014proposing a flat spot or side grips as a compromise between stability and the spherical aesthetic. He questioned hinge/flip concepts, noting a lid would likely remain open and add failure points; a permanent open form might be more realistic.\n\nFunctionally he stressed interoperability: support multiple devices and modern links (Bluetooth alongside cost\u2011effective IR). He flagged pointing issues with IR (front/back orientation) and suggested either sensors on multiple sides or clear directional cues so users instinctively know which way to point it.\n\nOn controls and interaction he advocated simplicity: fewer, easy\u2011to\u2011press buttons, tactile differentiation so users can feel controls without looking, and illuminated or glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark feedback (or lighting only applicable buttons) for use in the dark. He also mentioned an optional simple display to show functions. He discussed ergonomic tradeoffs\u2014one\u2011handed use vs. size (too small harms function; too large harms handling)\u2014and noted game\u2011pad style contours/grips as a possible approach for full\u2011hand comfort.\n\nDurability and cost were recurring constraints: make it sturdy to survive drops/throws, keep production costs low (\u2248\u20ac12.50 target), and accept tradeoffs between innovation, usability, robustness and price.",
    "On Erasmus and student mobility the group\u2019s view was clear: Erasmus is a well\u2011established, efficient, internationally recognised mechanism and losing access would be damaging and costly to replace. They noted that Erasmus does not cover all mobility costs (an example given was Cardiff where only c.40% of mobility funding is paid by Erasmus+), so institutions already top up mobility from other income. The sector is committed to protecting mobility: seven of eight Welsh universities referenced mobility in their fee and access plans and are exploring funding from their own fee income where necessary. However witnesses argued a Welsh\u2011only substitute would be less efficient and more expensive; the preferred position is to retain UK access to the successor Erasmus/Horizon arrangements and, if needed, to add a Wales\u2011level top\u2011up.\n\nOn tuition\u2011fee refunds the group did not endorse blanket refunds. Ministers and HE witnesses stressed university autonomy and existing institutional quality\u2011assurance, appeals routes and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator as the proper mechanisms for student complaints. The expectation is that institutions will move learning online, continue to meet duty of care (including support for students who cannot return home), and that maintenance support will continue. There was no ministerial commitment to automatic tuition refunds; instead students are to be protected through institutional procedures, awarding\u2011body arrangements and national adjudication routes, with Student Finance/Student Loans processes to respond to individual changes of circumstances.",
    "Local authoritative frameworks: speakers repeatedly referenced the roles and limits of local, provincial and municipal authorities. Panels stressed that provinces/authorities must lead on health, school provision and justice administration (e.g., health transfers, RCMP exclusion zones, PRU/EOTAS oversight). Welsh witnesses and WLGA noted devolved responsibility for school exclusions, ALN services and regional skills partnerships, urging clearer governance, better data and locally coordinated commissioning/quality-assurance of alternative education providers.\n\nCondolences: multiple members offered condolences for recent deaths and tragedies\u2014local figures (e.g., Stephan Lavoie, Tristan Roy), pandemic losses in long\u2011term care, and international and domestic victims of police violence (George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, indigenous victims in Canada). Several speeches tied condolences to calls to address systemic racism and to protect protesters\u2019 rights.\n\nEmployment: much discussion about employment supports and gaps\u2014CEWS, CEBA, CERB, Canada Summer Jobs, EI eligibility, sectoral programs for forestry, airports and small business. Concerns focused on people approaching CERB cut\u2011off, seasonal and migrant workers, reunifying separated families for essential travel, and government efforts to expand and adapt supports.\n\nWorkers\u2019 safety: repeated concern for frontline and long\u2011term care worker safety (PPE procurement, CAF deployments), migrant farmworker housing and health coverage, and police use of force. Witnesses urged better PPE supply chains, improved living/work conditions for temporary workers, and culturally competent policing reforms.\n\nPay dispute situations: two types raised\u2014(1) UK/Wales FE pay dispute where colleges and unions are deadlocked (employers offering low increases, colleges seeking additional funding to match schoolteacher pay; ColegauCymru negotiations ongoing); (2) Canada: problems from SUB/top\u2011up arrangements creating CERB ineligibility and repayment demands for workers (examples like Soprema), plus political controversy over employers/parties accessing wage subsidies.",
    "The remarks from Whitehorse expressed two distinct thank\u2011yous. First, thanks to the House of Commons were implicit in the honour of speaking to the House from Whitehorse (on the traditional territory of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation and the Ta\u2019an Kw\u00e4ch\u2019\u00e4n Council) to mark Yukon\u2019s recent milestone \u2014 the establishment of Yukon University, Canada\u2019s first university north of 60. The speaker used the opportunity to congratulate Yukon College staff and the outgoing president, Karen Barnes, and to encourage northern students to take advantage of new local post\u2011secondary opportunities.\n\nSecond, members of the Canadian Armed Forces were publicly thanked for their work in long\u2011term care homes. MPs acknowledged CAF teams (including Brigadier\u2011General Conrad Mialkowski and his team) for conducting assessments and reporting on appalling conditions in several Ontario long\u2011term care facilities. Those CAF observations and testimonies revealed severe neglect \u2014 seniors left to starve, abused and living in filth \u2014 and were described as historic, prompting calls for immediate action, reform and national standards to protect vulnerable elders.",
    "The group converged on a pragmatic, fashion-forward TV remote: functionally simple, ergonomically comfortable, and commercially realistic. Key functions prioritized were basic TV control (power, channel up/down, volume) \u2014 management required a TV-only design, and the team agreed the prioritized functional requirement is a simple, single\u2011function television remote that reliably performs those core tasks. \u201cFindability\u201d (a pager/locator) was also emphasized as an important secondary function\u2014many users lose remotes\u2014so a small transmitter/sticker for the TV that triggers the handset (beep/vibrate/light via radio) was proposed.\n\nCharacter and design requirements:\n- User-focused: large, durable, tactile controls for frequent functions; minimal button clutter; ergonomic curved shape; optional lock/flip to avoid accidental presses.\n- Materials/appearance: plastic/rubber case (recycled/high\u2011grade plastic preferred), fashionable colour variants (youth fruity colours vs autumn tones for older users), logo integration, possible interchangeable faceplates considered but deferred for cost.\n- Interface tech: touch LCD/touchpad with submenus for less-used features, back-up physical buttons for core controls; rechargeable batteries with docking station; infra\u2011red for TV signalling; CPU/chip for state and touch coordination.\n- Accessibility: raised/embossed buttons, glow-in-the-dark or timed backlight to aid use in dark, and consideration for older users (large buttons, simple menu).\n\nScroll feature discussion: a small side scroll control was debated. Some argued scrolling is faster for long lists/menus and settings (useful when many options), while others preferred discrete submenus with a clear back button for simplicity. Consensus: include a scrolling option only if menus are extensive; otherwise prioritize simple menu navigation and prominent back/home controls.",
    "Main topics planned for the next meeting\n- Administrative: confirm minutes, post project documentation, each member to complete a short questionnaire and summary; coach will send specific instructions by email.\n- Requirements and design decisions: review new project requirements, decide core remote functions (prioritise channel change and volume), and align functional, conceptual and working design (what it should do vs. how it will work).\n- Prototyping and technology choices: review prototypes/user\u2011interface concepts, discuss infra\u2011red signalling, chip design, battery/solar options (tradeoffs between solar/ecological positioning and budget), and the slide\u2011out panel/cover options.\n- Cost and market positioning: reconcile production cost target (~\u20ac12.50) with features (selling price \u20ac25), consider options to stay under budget (material or solar removal) and tiered product lines.\n- Roles and next steps: ID to deliver components concept, UI to deliver interface concept, Marketing to update market trends; schedule a detailed design meeting to evaluate prototypes.\n\nMarketing\u2019s view on RSI and ergonomics\n- Marketing flagged R.S.I. (repetitive strain injury/carpal tunnel) as a clear user concern from usability tests. They recommend ergonomics be a core requirement: larger, fewer buttons emphasising frequent actions (channel up/down, channel skip, volume), \u201cless is more\u201d visibility, attractive/fashionable styling (75% found remotes ugly; 80% would pay more for a better look), and avoid designs that cause repetitive strain.\n\nGroup reflection on past meetings and progress\n- Generally productive and creative; prototypes largely meet functional goals (voice detection/slide\u2011out panel working), but information flow dropped late in sessions and some role boundaries were fuzzy. Team noted successful use of tech (PowerPoint) but want clearer documentation and more collaborative brainstorming in future meetings.",
    "The lab tests (100 users) showed strong preference for a simplified, stylish remote: users typically use only ~10% of existing buttons, so the team should focus on a small set (power, channel up/down, volume, mute) and make those prominent and easy to find. Many respondents were willing to pay more for desirable features (younger users especially receptive to voice recognition), but overall usability and low learning time were priorities.\n\nFinder/call button: the group repeatedly proposed a \u201cfinder\u201d system: a small transmitter/sender on the TV (or a separate base) that, when pressed, sends a radio signal to the remote so it beeps/alerts. They rejected putting the caller on the remote itself (you can\u2019t press it if it\u2019s lost). Radio (rather than IR) was preferred for the locating signal because IR needs line-of-sight. Output options discussed were beep/buzzer (favored because it works under sofas), LED or vibration as alternatives.\n\nButton design and location function details: they debated a joystick/joystick-click or an iPod-style circular touch wheel for navigation (thumb-operated, one-handed use), with up/down mapped to volume and left/right to channels; a small menu/function button + OK were suggested for mode changes. Buttons should be larger, grouped by function and possibly color-coded; less-used functions accessible via a menu on the TV. IR remains the transmission method for commands; batteries power the remote; locating uses a radio receiver and buzzer/LED.\n\nLighting-adaptive options: the team agreed not to include lighting-adaptive features\u2014market feedback showed low interest and the group judged it complex and unnecessary for this TV-only remote.",
    "DAT / far\u2011field data: they noticed the newly released Santa Barbara corpus uses DAT recorders and thought that corpus could be a useful, low\u2011cost source of far\u2011field/far\u2011mic style data for early recognizer/adaptation experiments. They flagged it as something they can obtain quickly and possibly use to adapt meeting recognizers.\n\nPower, cabling, mic hardware: lots of practical concerns. They debated lapel vs. headset vs. table mics, phantom power vs. local powering (they dropped a clever phantom\u2011power idea), and whether wired vs. wireless receivers are preferable. Key engineering priorities: a neat patch\u2011panel/cabinet design, clear LED \u201clive\u201d indicators, robust connectors and cable\u2011sleeving, mixer access, and handling unplug/repatch cases. They want to avoid confusing cross\u2011talk (lapel vs. other channels) and plan to use mix outputs, cross\u2011correlation and careful wiring to detect/remove false overlaps.\n\nCapturing subject intention: for the Heidelberg/tourist task they decided to elicit real intentions by letting subjects pick a few high\u2011level activities (shopping, sightseeing, etc.), prepare an itinerary using a schematic map (notes allowed but not full text), and then interact with the system. An instructor will help elicit intentions so the experimenter knows the true goal (e.g., \u201cbuy a cuckoo clock\u201d), enabling automatic classification into modes like Enter/View/Approach and linking to action schemas.\n\nAnalysis approaches considered: multi\u2011level annotation (phones, reduced pronunciations, articulatory/gestural features), seed automatic labels plus human corrections, channel\u2011specific speech/non\u2011speech detectors, forced alignment on channelized transcripts, manual tight timebands from multiple meetings for training, small controlled comparisons (digits vs. conversational speech), and model directions such as multi\u2011band feature estimators (gradient+EM), with advice sought from phonetics experts (Ohala/John) for feature taxonomies.",
    "The group converged on a simple, ergonomic remote with a docking station and a \u201ctelephone\u201d form (single\u2011curved casing preferred to angle the (small) display). Core functional spec: essential buttons only (on/off, channel up/down, volume, 0\u20139, subtitle toggle, one prominent confirm/power button), reliable infra\u2011red transmission, rechargeable battery via docking station (docking also provides a \u201cfind remote\u201d beep). Kinetic power was discussed but largely rejected for older users and budget reasons. The chipset must be sufficiently advanced to support the interface and IR reliability.\n\nCase design: they agreed to one standard remote body with interchangeable outer covers (changeable cases) so the product can be offered with different finishes (wood\u2011look and grey/black/plastic); everyone accepted offering replaceable covers as a distinguishing feature/upsell. Single color case production (with logo and slogan placement) and single\u2011curved shape were chosen for manufacturability and ergonomics.\n\nDesign changes over time: the concept evolved several times\u2014initial ideas included a \u201csnowman\u201d shape, rubber buttons, jog\u2011dial and a kinetic/no\u2011LCD option; cost and production limits forced revisions. The team briefly added a small LCD + jog\u2011dial to hide advanced functions, then removed the LCD (and rubber trim) again to meet budget, deciding instead to show advanced feedback on the TV and keep advanced functions hidden or accessible via a simple scroll/confirm interaction or a slide\u2011out hatch. Overall emphasis settled on simplicity, fashion and cost feasibility.",
    "Huw David said he did not expect major unintended consequences if the Bill is implemented carefully, but warned that this depends entirely on proper implementation and resourcing. He stressed that children's services are \u201cat breaking point\u201d and that without additional investment the Bill could increase pressure on overstretched front\u2011line services (via greater awareness, referrals or demand for preventative support). He therefore urged a clear commitment that any additional costs be met and emphasised the need to invest in universal early\u2011help and family support to prevent escalation into crisis or care placements.\n\nOn whether legislation is needed given changing behaviour and culture, he argued the Bill is still necessary. He framed it as a reflection and consolidation of an existing cultural shift\u2014most parents now reject physical punishment\u2014and as providing clarity for children, parents and professionals about where the legal line lies. He noted serious abuse is already criminalised but that removing ambiguity helps vulnerable children recognise unacceptable treatment and supports the UNCRC obligations.\n\nOn whether awareness\u2011raising should be explicit in the Bill, he initially noted the Welsh Government\u2019s commitment but then stated his view clearly: the WLGA believes there should be a duty on Ministers on the face of the Bill to carry out awareness\u2011raising. He argued this would ensure clarity for local authorities and frontline services and help secure the resources and accountability needed for successful implementation.",
    "They explored a two\u2011sided/dual\u2011mode idea (one face with a full, feature\u2011rich layout for advanced functions; the other a very simple \u201cgrandma\u201d side with just channel/volume/mute). Pro: it could combine power and simplicity and target different users in one unit. Con: several people worried about usability \u2014 flipping or manipulating a two\u2011sided device might be awkward in normal use, and mode changes risk confusion.\n\nEvaluation/market range: the team felt the concept was quirky and sellable if positioned as a trendy impulse purchase (target price ~\u20ac25, production cap ~\u00a312.50). Their prototype evaluations were generally positive (average score ~1.8 on their true\u2013false scale), but they agreed the product should focus on TV control (management limited scope) and that one main target with cosmetic variants (covers/colors) was more realistic than trying to serve all segments with separate electronics.\n\nTechnical requirements and robustness: they debated materials \u2014 hard smooth plastic vs spongy rubber casing. Hard plastic gives rigidity and durability; rubber/silicone offers shock absorption and a \u201ctouchy\u2011feely\u201d look. Concerns were raised that a curved/banana shape plus spongy material might be fragile or prone to breaking unless reinforced. Waterproofing was discussed as a desirable selling point (bath use) but seen as potentially costly; practical options included selling an integrated protective cover or packaging a waterproof sleeve rather than full IP sealing. Other technical features agreed on: infrared emitter placement, rubber buttons, a find\u2011remote beep/light, child\u2011lock, and the possibility of kinetic or solar power was noted but excluded for cost/complexity.",
    "Group 3 centred on the technical regulation-making powers tied to commencement and implementation of section 1. The Deputy Minister explained amendment 3 restores limited transitory/transitional/saving powers on the face of the Bill (and fixes commencement to the day after Royal Assent via amendment 6), arguing no new powers are being added, that the changes reduce rather than expand ministerial scope, and that CLAC had not required an Assembly procedure for such powers. She stressed these are technical matters and said wider powers were not thought necessary, though she would keep the issue under review.\n\nSuzy Davies tabled amendment 3A as a probing/holding amendment. Her concern was that the narrow transitory provisions may be insufficient to implement practical measures the Bill will require (for example elements of the awareness campaign, reporting arrangements and other implementation detail). She argued the Welsh Ministers might need a more usual, unrestricted regulation\u2011making power to make consequential or implementation regulations and that the Assembly should have clarity over the nature of any statutory instrument (affirmative/negative) used. Suzy framed 3A as a safeguard to revisit at Stage 3, seeking explicit discussion and Assembly input on the scope and procedure for any regulations. The Deputy Minister accepted the need to discuss the matter further before Stage 3, but maintained she did not currently believe broader powers were necessary.",
    "Brexit and Welsh fee/access plans\n- HEFCW sees Brexit as an added source of uncertainty layered onto existing funding pressures (Diamond review implementation, pay/pension/capital costs). UCAS data show EU-domiciled applications to Wales down ~8% (non\u2011EU down ~9%) while England rose; causes cited include loss of previous EU student grant/support arrangements, competitiveness (fewer high\u2011tariff/brand institutions, capital/infrastructure investment gaps), and perceptions about welcome/safety.\n- Fee and access plans are stress\u2011tested against recruitment and financial forecasts. If EU recruitment falls, fee income falls and planned fee\u2011funded investments (including mobility) may need revising; HEFCW can require institutions to amend plans and monitors post\u2011submission outcomes.\n- Executive/planning measures: institutions are running contingency scenarios and managed deficits, developing marketing (Study in Wales) and diversification strategies, pressing UK/Welsh Government to secure Horizon/Erasmus access or successor arrangements, and seeking replacement funding where needed. HEFCW engages institutions, challenges weak governance/planning and uses sector forecasts to monitor sustainability.\n- Student protection: HEFCW has a formal MoU with NUS Wales, requires student charters and quality\u2011assurance protections (QAA standards), insists institutions protect enrolled students if courses or providers close, and encourages institution\u2011level measures (some universities already include mobility targets in fee plans).\n\nPPE local production questioning (Canada)\n- MPs pressed ministers about domestic supply of surgical masks, N95s and gowns. Government reported 101.3M surgical masks received and multiple contracts with domestic suppliers (cited Medicom for N95s, General Motors for surgical masks, Novo Textiles retooling). Some contracts were cancelled when suppliers failed to meet Canadian standards; ministers stressed priority on safe/effective equipment and supporting domestic capacity while meeting standards.\n\nStatus of infrastructure projects awaiting approval (Canada)\n- Minister said the government has approved \u201chundreds\u201d of projects in recent weeks but did not provide an exact count of remaining files; MPs pressed that many projects remain pending and that construction season timing is a concern. The minister committed to provide detailed numbers/updates.",
    "Middle tier (education/system \u201cmiddle tier\u201d) \u2014 key points\n- Purpose: the middle tier (regional consortia, local authorities, challenge advisers) mediates between national policy and schools \u2014 providing scale, specialist capacity and school-improvement delivery while preserving local accountability.  \n- Need for clarity and consistency: Strategic delivery work (chaired by Professor Dylan Jones) is reviewing roles/responsibilities to remove duplication, build collective efficacy and agree expectations across the middle tier.  \n- National approach, regional delivery: Ministers value regional scale for effective school improvement but do not intend immediate centralisation; emphasis is on nationally consistent practice delivered regionally.  \n- Early identification and multi\u2011agency response: The middle tier must use richer intelligence (beyond headline data) \u2014 e.g., staff sickness, pupil movement, complaints \u2014 to triage risk, step in earlier and join multi\u2011agency panels (local authority, consortia, inspectorate, government) to drive sustainable improvement.  \n- Self\u2011evaluation and tools: Co\u2011constructed national evaluation and improvement resource (not a \u201ctick\u2011box\u201d toolkit) and OECD independent reviews are being used to strengthen middle\u2011tier capability and accountability.\n\nGovernment support for elderly and vulnerable people in Canada \u2014 key points\n- Rapid income supports: CERB was deployed quickly to millions (trade\u2011off: speed vs. later audit/fraud detection); supplementary measures addressed gaps (Canada Child Benefit increases, wage subsidy, targeted industry support).  \n- Seniors supports: one\u2011time top\u2011ups announced (GST/OAS/GIS supplements totalling up to ~$500 for most vulnerable), plus expansion of programs (New Horizons) for services and delivery.  \n- Homeless and housing: emergency hotel placements and federal shelter funding were mobilized; calls for matched federal funding and permanent housing solutions remain.  \n- Long\u2011term care crisis: high COVID death rates in LTC exposed systemic failures\u2014widespread calls for national standards, stronger oversight, funding tied to enforcement and reconsideration of private vs public delivery.  \n- Targeted vulnerable groups: petitions and programs seek national perinatal mental\u2011health strategy, supports for Indigenous and seasonal/remote workers, and better PPE and procurement for frontline/vulnerable populations.  \n- Ongoing gaps: concerns about uneven provincial supports, PPE supply/quality, and need for broader reforms (e.g., pharmacare, vaccine access equity) were repeatedly raised.",
    "The marketing expert is enthusiastic about the product\u2019s marketability and consistently frames decisions around positioning, user identification, and aesthetic trends. They like the tangible features (locator/\"where\u2019s my remote\" base, cradle, scroll wheel/favourites) and push for silver/black styling, optional color panels, glow-in-the-dark or spongey/fruit-inspired finishes to create a distinctive, pride-worthy object. Their product strategy favors an exclusivity/higher-price positioning (\u20ac35\u201350) rather than mass-market low-margin pricing, and they propose a lifetime guarantee as a customer-facing trust signal.\n\nOn user identification and intelligence, marketing supports adding speech recognition but prefers speaker-dependent (not costly speaker-independent) approaches to control complexity and cost. They explicitly suggest the remote could \u201cknow who is using it,\u201d log channel and volume habits, and personalize behavior\u2014both as a usability enhancement and a sales pitch. They also propose speech as an alternative to clapping for location (\"ask\" the remote). Upgradability (cards/modules) is raised as a selling and product-lifecycle idea, though marketing recognizes warranty/complexity trade-offs.\n\nPractically, they advocate batteries over solar cells, simpler push-buttons (or a small non-touch LCD for status) to save cost while reserving space/budget for speech features. Overall their perspective prioritizes design and novelty first, technological innovation second, and basic remote usability last\u2014aiming to create a fashionable, talked-about device with identity-aware personalization as a differentiation point.",
    "Universal adoption\n- The Cabinet Secretary expects the Welsh Baccalaureate to become an entitlement and the norm (targeted by 2020), meaning all institutions should be able to deliver it\u2014not a blanket forced obligation for every pupil. Flexibility must remain for individual wellbeing cases. Performance measures and a national professional learning offer are expected to drive more consistent roll\u2011out, but concerns remain about uneven delivery, some schools/colleges coercing pupils, and learners crossing the border to avoid the qualification.\n\nAdvantages (what has worked)\n- For the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015: it established four strategic aims (regulation, protecting public good from public funding, fair access, and institutional autonomy), strengthened HEFCW\u2019s powers of oversight, and enabled government levers (remit letters/outcome expectations) to secure sector commitments (e.g. living wage, pay transparency, mental\u2011health initiatives).\n- The Welsh Baccalaureate: grading has increased perceived rigour; universities generally treat it as A\u2011level equivalent or value it in offers/interviews; it develops project and employability skills and has growing postgraduate/part\u2011time uptake benefits.\n\nWeaknesses and gaps\n- Mixed evidence on whether the 2015 Act fully delivered its aims; some argue its framing around institutional autonomy limits enforceability of national outcomes.\n- HEFCW\u2019s intervention toolkit is seen as having too few intermediate steps (informal to severe), making swift, proportionate action hard.\n- The Act\u2019s charity\u2011only definition limits regulation of alternative/private providers.\n- Fee and access plans are bureaucratic, input\u2011focused and short\u2011term; stakeholders want longer outcome\u2011focused agreements.\n- Governance was not directly reformed by the Act; QA across FE/HE (and TNE) is fragmented and workload/consistency issues persist for the Welsh Bacc.\n- Conclusion: reforms via the PCET Bill aim to carry protections forward but add outcome agreements, softer graduated regulatory powers, governance expectations and QA alignment to address these weaknesses.",
    "The group\u2019s discussion and presentation of the evaluation criteria focused on a structured, item-by-item scoring process and using those scores to steer design and cost decisions. Cat/marketing presented a checklist of criteria (scale 1\u20137) covering conformity to user requirements, functionality, technical novelty, ergonomics/RSI risk, intuitiveness and learnability, simplicity, fashion/look-and-feel, propensity to be lost, international appeal, materials/colours and cost implications. Each team member scored the prototype independently and marketing agreed to tabulate averages (they noted the overall mean landed around mid\u2011six).\n\nDuring the evaluation they identified strengths: strong ergonomics/\u201cspongy\u201d rubber feel, fashionable/fun aesthetic for the young target, simplicity of primary functions, and good potential market appeal. Concerns raised: learning curve for the menu/scroll\u2011wheel approach, non\u2011standard numeric layout, right\u2011hand bias (left\u2011hander usability), potential confusion over buttons that change function (teletext/menu), and risks/costs of added gimmicks.\n\nFinance constrained several decisions: the group dropped costly items (LCD, speech recognition, the complex sample speaker) and kept a simple beep and a locator concept; they chose a basic chip and simpler components to meet the \u20ac12.5 target. They agreed to flag left\u2011hand usability, special\u2011colour costs, and the need for user focus groups/further market research for management review before final sign\u2011off.",
    "CDs for backup\nParticipants were skeptical about relying on CDs as the sole archive. Pressed CDs (commercially produced) last longer, but burned CDs/DVDs can fail within 1\u20133 years; some reported failures in a year. Consensus: don\u2019t keep only a CD copy. Preferred practice was to use tape (robot tape backups) for archival storage and to keep data on disk for active use. Suggestions included using both tape and CDs (or re-burning CDs periodically), adding more disk/storage servers, putting infrequently accessed data on a cheaper disk pool, and automating archival so nightly backups aren\u2019t overloaded. Overall: CDs are an OK supplementary medium but not a sole, long-term archival strategy.\n\nProbability computation (combining influences in belief nets)\nThe group explored how to combine multiple parent \u201copinions\u201d into a single decision node without exploding CPT size. Simple options: unweighted voting (averages) and weighted averages (manually set weights). More expressive: a \u201cmixture-of-experts\u201d hidden node (H) that selects or weights experts conditionally; H can be learned or hand-crafted. They stressed modularization / intermediate nodes (encapsulate compatibility, user-fit, ontology outputs) to avoid huge CPTs. Practical constraints: limited annotated data, so initial nets and weights will be hand-crafted and explored interactively (JavaBayes, etc.), with learning considered later if sufficient data becomes available.\n\nExperimental setup of the computer-navigation (tourist) system\nThey will run constrained Wizard-of-Oz style studies in a small lab: subjects view a 3D/QuickTime Heidelberg scene, are told a capable system exists, and perform tasks (get directions, buy stamps, take a picture). The system is told to \u201cknow\u201d user location (GPS) and may provide a display (2D/track movement). Sessions simulate a system crash mid-session, then switch to a human operator to collect both machine and human-mediated dialogues. Acoustic capture uses multiple synchronized channels: pressure\u2011zone tabletop mics and close\u2011talk mics (for ground truth and beamforming). Recordings and multi-channel data will be archived and potentially released (LDC); transcription conventions and corpus labeling will be handled separately.",
    "They rejected putting duplicate (symmetrical) controls on both sides mainly for usability and design-simplicity reasons: team members said having buttons on both sides would make the interface harder to use and complicate the ergonomic design, and it wasn\u2019t seen as necessary because the remote\u2019s functions are basic and users can adapt. During the prototype review the Project Manager floated making distinct right\u2011 and left\u2011handed versions. That idea drew a mixed, but largely skeptical, response. Some joked that it was possible and others noted it would add cost and complexity (and asked whether families would need two remotes). The industrial designer and marketing argued people routinely adapt (e.g., use right\u2011handed mice) and that separate handed versions weren\u2019t essential. The Project Manager acknowledged the design was slightly biased toward right\u2011hand use, and the team said if they did produce left\u2011 and right\u2011handed models they would score the design better on handedness, but overall the group leaned toward keeping a single standard shape rather than building two mirrored variants.",
    "The group\u2019s cost-reduction discussion centered on meeting a strict production-cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50 to keep the project viable. To hit that target they proposed removing or downgrading costly components: solar cells were dropped and speech/voice recognition\u2014seen as innovative but expensive and hard to implement within resources\u2014was explicitly scrapped. They also agreed to eliminate the special yellow finish from the base product (delivering a standard black/grey unit instead) and to switch some parts from rubber to cheaper plastic (notably buttons, and possibly the basic cover) where necessary.\n\nThey weighed trade-offs: the LCD is costly but considered more valuable than voice recognition, so they leaned toward keeping the LCD while cutting the speech feature. Rubber \u201cspongy\u201d feel and the curved \u201cbanana\u201d shape were debated; ultimately they favored keeping the curve and rubber where it added clear value, but conceded losing color and optional styling to save cost. To preserve design/fashion appeal without raising base price, they proposed selling custom covers (and potentially different button frames) as paid accessories so customers can personalize the unit without increasing standard production costs.\n\nUnderlying issues driving these choices included limited manufacturing component options, lack of early cost information, and constrained resources\u2014factors that forced prioritization of core functionality and manufacturability to reduce production cost and ensure acceptable profit margins.",
    "Pros:\n- Strong customer interest: market research showed many users would pay more for more intuitive controls like voice recognition, so it\u2019s a clear selling point and potential upsell.\n- Marketing appeal: fits the \u201chigh\u2011tech / fashionable\u201d brief and would help position the product for younger, gadget\u2011savvy buyers (15\u201335 / 25\u201335 age brackets).\n- Accessibility: could benefit users with physical disabilities, widening the product\u2019s appeal and social value.\n- Differentiator: gives the remote a distinct selling point beyond just looks and basic controls.\n\nCons:\n- Reliability/usability concerns: team members reported existing systems that performed poorly (users ended up \u201cyelling\u201d at the device), risking frustration and bad user experience.\n- Cost and complexity: adding speech recognition increases hardware, software, and development cost and could push up price and time\u2011to\u2011market\u2014conflicting with the brief to keep the product simple.\n- Power and component constraints: voice requires a microphone and extra processing power, affecting battery life and possibly necessitating a rechargeable design (more cost/complexity).\n- Interaction and transmission issues: if users need to hold the remote to their mouth, that may block IR line\u2011of\u2011sight to the TV (or force a different transmission technology).\n- Risk of locking into a technology: team preferred focusing on functions first and keeping voice recognition optional (on/off) rather than committing immediately.\n\nOverall conclusion from the group: voice recognition is attractive and marketable but should be considered optional or phased\u2014only added if reliability, cost, power, and transmission issues can be solved without compromising simplicity and time\u2011to\u2011market.",
    "They reviewed many power options and the Industrial Designer framed the general requirements: a long\u2011lasting, low\u2011cost, compact energy source that supports an IR transmitter and occasional features (backlight, locator beeper) without making the handset bulky. Benefits/drawbacks discussed:\n- Disposable AA/AAA: cheap and widely available (AA common), but bulkier (contributes to chunky remotes). AAA is smaller/thinner (good for slimmer form) but still adds size.\n- Small lithium (phone) cells + charger: long run time and familiar user behavior (dock/charge overnight); reduces frequent battery swaps but raises cost/complexity and dock/space considerations.\n- Solar: potentially useful but needs sizeable cells, less robust to drops, and adds cost/visibility constraints.\n- Dynamo (wind\u2011up): unusual, mechanically awkward and impractical for users.\n- Kinetic (watch\u2011type) rechargeable: tiny cell charged by motion; compact, durable, and can often keep up with the small intermittent draw of an IR remote.\n\nConservation of battery life: Industrial Designer recommended standby behavior (turn off indicator/backlight after 5\u201310s), efficient chip design, and keeping the IR bursts efficient to minimize draw.\n\nTriple A batteries: noted as the smallest conventional primary cells and useful if a thinner product is desired, but users more commonly have AAs and batteries still make remotes chunky.\n\nDecision: the team settled on a rechargeable kinetic/watch\u2011type solution (kinetic charging with a small cell) rather than AA/AAA disposables, plus a docking/charging concept.\n\nWhy recommend a charger for industrial/working design: a charger/rechargeable battery gives consistent, long\u2011term power for prototypes and users (no frequent replacement), supports siloed testing and features (beeper/dock), reduces lifecycle cost and waste, and avoids the bulk and intermittency problems of primary cells during development and regular use.",
    "They wanted to put the project into a conference paper for several practical and strategic reasons:\n\n- To document and publicize what the team has built so far (Bayes\u2011net, ontology/discourse ideas) and thereby preserve progress from the past six months. Documentation was explicitly called \u201cnever a bad idea.\u201d\n\n- To use the conference\u2019s interdisciplinary audience (neuro/cognitive/architectures of NLP) as an appropriate forum for their hybrid, cognitively\u2011motivated approach and to get useful feedback from that community.\n\n- To present a concrete, manageable example (the \u201cwhere is X\u201d construction) as a worked case that demonstrates how their ontology + discourse + Bayes\u2011net ideas could be modeled even without full system evaluation. A short position/description paper can show the idea and initial design even if empirical results aren\u2019t yet available.\n\n- To introduce and test a new formalism (and related diagrams) in a short paper format; even a brief exposition and example would help make the approach clearer to others.\n\n- Because deadlines and opportunity: the conference date (Sept 22, Saarbr\u00fccken) was close, Johno would send the call link, and colleagues (Jerry, Nancy) could review drafts. They also noted that writing the paper is a way to know whether there\u2019s a paper to write and that a rejected submission still yields useful artifacts and visibility.\n\n- Finally, it was seen as low\u2011risk: a short (4\u20136 page) interdisciplinary piece could be produced quickly and could seed future, fuller papers.",
    "Kirsty Williams said the extra, in\u2011year funding routed via regional consortia (for example c.\u00a35m for professional learning) was intended to reach schools and be used where leaders and regional challenge advisers identify priority needs (such as improving Welsh baccalaureate delivery). She stressed the money is allocated to consortia to distribute to schools and expected it would be spent on agreed professional learning; she acknowledged members\u2019 concerns and said she would encourage consortia to target underperforming schools.\n\nOn university governance she accepted recent high\u2011profile failures had focused attention. The 2015 Act did not directly resolve governance issues; she welcomed the independent Gillian Camm review (jointly commissioned by Universities Wales and HEFCW) and supports stronger expectations on governing bodies. She wants one\u2011to\u2011one engagement with chairs, improved diversity, governor development (AdvanceHE work) and is exploring a regulatory condition on good governance in the new PCET Bill.\n\nOn mergers she was cautious: she has no policy drive to force mergers and is not actively promoting them, but is not opposed if institutions themselves see clear student\u2011 or system\u2011benefits. Her priority is a sustainable, student\u2011centred sector; mergers would be considered on that basis.\n\nOn admissions problems (notably the fall in EU students) she attributed much of the drop to loss of the prior Welsh tuition\u2011fee grant and Brexit uncertainty. Her responses: guarantee EU student support for the next academic year, press UK Government on Erasmus/Horizon underwrites and immigration/post\u2011study visas, invest in international marketing (Global Wales funding), work with HEFCW/universities on postgraduate support and on improving institutions\u2019 offers and outcome\u2011focused agreements (moving from annual fee/access inputs to longer\u2011term outcome agreements) to address recruitment and access issues.",
    "Energy source: The team reviewed batteries, a charging base, solar cells, hand dynamos and kinetic (shake) power. They debated size/weight trade-offs (base requires bigger unit; small = no base) and battery types (AAA vs lithium). After cost and tech discussions the final choice settled on kinetic power as the primary energy source (though batteries/lithium had been considered earlier during trade-off discussion).\n\nTechnological innovation: The group prioritized simple, user-friendly tech with one clear novel element: kinetic energy harvesting to power the remote. They also explored and had access to newly developed sample sensor/speaker chips from manufacturing, planned LED illumination on button press, and a locator function (whistle/recognition-style finder) rather than full voice-command control. Full voice activation for channel control was discussed but rejected as too complex/unreliable and costly; voice tech might be limited to the locator feature. Other tech choices include basic IR Morse-like signaling circuitry, integrated chips, and push/scroll controls with tactile shapes.\n\nOverall evaluation and decision: The team rated the prototype as ergonomically strong, fashionable and marketable\u2014gunmetal plastic body, rubber buttons, replaceable latex covers (fashionable accents), side scrolls and a single hand curvature. It met budget constraints and production considerations, was judged sufficiently innovative due to the kinetic power and sensor chips, and was positively received by the group. Remaining concerns: right- vs left-handed ergonomics, manufacturing quantities for variant covers, and implementation details for the locator/voice features. Overall verdict: proceed with the kinetic-powered ergonomic remote prototype; refine handedness, cover logistics and finalize component costs.",
    "Technical issues: the group focused on keeping electronics simple and low\u2011cost. They agreed on infrared as the standard transmitter, favored simple discrete push\u2011buttons over expensive chip\u2011on\u2011print/display solutions, and discussed PCB cost, battery life and reliability. They debated advanced controls (scroll wheel, stick) but rejected fragile/RSI\u2011unfriendly options. A lock button and limited, well\u2011laid out key set (power, volume, channel, num pad) were preferred. Adding extra functions (speech recognition, Bluetooth, displays) was seen as attractive but costly and technically complex; Sebastian was tasked to investigate feasibility for a \u201cfind\u201d function and other enhancements.\n\nEnergy source: they reviewed batteries, hand dynamos, solar and kinetic (watch\u2011style). The team settled on a kinetic/self\u2011charging approach integrated with a rubber, squeezable case\u2014charging by user handling/squeezing\u2014possibly supplemented by a cradle or hybrid solar/rechargeable scheme if costs permit.\n\nProject announcement email: the project manager said instructions and task assignments would be emailed to everyone between meetings (who does what, deliverables and next steps). They also noted that coaches/bosses would be in touch and that any unclear responsibilities would be clarified via email.\n\nSample sensor: marketing raised a recently developed \u201csample sensor / speaker\u201d (speech recognition). The group was skeptical: the demonstrated sensor behaved like the coffee\u2011machine demo (pre\u2011programmed responses), not natural command recognition, and would be expensive. They concluded speech/speaker tech is not appropriate for the core product now, though sound/LED locator ideas and a possible base\u2011station \u201cfind\u201d function merit further technical cost/feasibility study.",
    "The last meeting reviewed the prototype and clarified decisions, outstanding issues, and action items. Key points: the team committed to a novel, ergonomic, rubber-coated \u201cnon-remote\u201d shape with a spongy feel, simple primary buttons (power, channel up/down, volume up/down) plus a slide\u2011out panel for advanced functions. Voice recognition was chosen as the principal differentiator; interchangeable faceplates/skins, child and \u201cjumbo\u201d versions, and a lock/child\u2011lock feature were discussed. The industrial designer described the electronics (IR LED, chip, resistors, capacitor, transistor) and options for energy (battery, rechargeable, kinetic/solar cell). Manufacturing choices favored printed circuit boards and rubber buttons over scroll wheels to control cost.\n\nProblems reviewed:\n- Budget overrun and cost tradeoffs: solar cell/backup battery are expensive and may push the product over the target price; removing the solar feature would bring costs down but weaken the environmental positioning.\n- Technical risk and cost of voice recognition: recognition accuracy, multi-user/room range, and expense need investigation.\n- Usability/market risk: left\u2011 vs right\u2011handed ergonomics, potential consumer confusion from too many features, and pull\u2011out panel ergonomics needing refinement.\n- Process issues: uneven information flow (missing slides/emails), limited materials/colors for prototypes, and drop\u2011off in detail toward the end of the day.\nNext steps implied: UI and industrial design jointly build a physical prototype, industrial designer to research voice\u2011recognition cost/feasibility and energy options, and marketing to refine two main selling claims.",
    "Hefin David raised doubts about the effectiveness and design of fee and access plans in higher education, arguing they are overly bureaucratic, focused on inputs not outcomes, and too short-term. He pressed for longer-term, outcome\u2011focused agreements and a more graduated set of regulatory responses (rather than \u201cmeeting without coffee\u201d to severe sanctions). On childcare, Hefin worried that the flat \u00a34.50 hourly rate could produce a two\u2011tier market \u2014 basic provision for lower\u2011income families with wealthier parents able to buy \u201cadd\u2011ons\u201d \u2014 and that extra daily charges (food, trips, nappies) would disproportionately hit the lowest\u2011income working families. He also asked about grandparents/unregistered carers, regional variations in demand, sector fragility, and whether capacity and workforce growth (English and Welsh medium) can be delivered in time. He specifically queried whether Cardiff and Newport \u2014 higher\u2011cost areas \u2014 would manage at \u00a34.50.\n\nMinister Huw Irranca\u2011Davies acknowledged many of these concerns. He highlighted the administrative burden in pilots and said that is why phased pilots were used and why the Government prefers a centralized, HMRC\u2011style eligibility system to reduce paperwork. He defended the \u00a34.50 rate as presently acceptable and simpler than the complex English model but said Cardiff/Newport pilots (imminent) will be used to test affordability and could prompt adjustment. On workforce and quality, he pointed to a 10\u2011year workforce plan, \u00a360m capital funding, targeted Welsh\u2011medium investment (cylch meithrin), and a focus on registered/inspected providers; he accepted there is tension between raising pay/qualifications and keeping affordability and committed to monitoring (Arad evaluation) and revisiting the rate/policy if pilots show it is necessary.",
    "On-line normalization\n- PhD C has been developing an on-line normalization scheme with two separate running means (speech vs silence) driven by the VAD probability, and an adaptive time constant (faster adaptation at utterance onset). He reports C0 (or log energy) is the most important coefficient to normalize; C1 shows strange, noise-dependent trajectories so separating speech/silence means may help there. He also tried per-band thresholding (adding white noise \u224815 dB below utterance peak per mel band) which smooths MFCC trajectories and makes clean/noisy cepstra look more similar; ASR performance was roughly unchanged. Differences in LDA filters and number of MFCCs also explain large performance jumps, so he advocates standardizing the base feature pipeline before comparing normalization methods. Professor B urged looking at detailed error types (insertions/deletions, noisy vs quiet cases) because aggregate scores can hide compensating effects.\n\nPhase normalization\n- PhD F and Grad G tried long-term mean subtraction and phase unwrapping respectively; results were poor (unwrapping made performance worse). Grad G suggested alternatives: operate in the complex domain and divide out the average complex spectrum rather than log-subtracting phase. Both he and the professor warned about scaling issues when taking logs (Taylor-series approximations can break if magnitudes aren\u2019t near unity).\n\nOpinions\n- PhD C: enthusiastic about the two-mean on-line scheme and adaptive time-constants, cautious about normalizing C1, and favors careful standardization before further comparisons. He did not endorse phase normalization approaches as-is.\n- Professor B: supportive of more careful experiments and error analysis, sees whitening/adding noise as a plausible way to reduce train/test mismatch, and is skeptical of na\u00efve phase unwrapping\u2014recommends complex-domain approaches and attention to scaling/Taylor approximations. On quals, the professor pushed students to complete targeted experiments before their quals and to scale models sensibly for training time.",
    "They debated how to detect and combine important linguistic features by treating multiple cue streams (multi\u2011band, multi\u2011stream) rather than a single monolithic front end. One strand focused on articulatory/phonetic features (voicing, nasality, sonorant etc.): options were to use canonical phone\u2011to\u2011feature mappings (TIMIT), to cluster continuous sensor-style data, or to get small sets of binary labels via manual annotation. Saul\u2019s style multi\u2011stream approach was highlighted: each band has its own detector (an \u201cAND\u201d of subdetectors), with soft \u201cOR\u201ds across bands, and a hidden variable controls how strongly each detector contributes. That lets the system down\u2011weight or ignore noisy bands instead of forcing equal training across everything; targets can be soft and learned with EM rather than hard phone labels, improving robustness under mismatch.\n\nIn the Bayesian combination discussion they proposed Noisy\u2011OR / related factorized combination functions (Heckerman-style intermediates) to avoid exponential CPTs. Noisy\u2011OR (and deterministic G functions) gives a compact parameterization: define per\u2011cue contributions and a small set of intermediate tables, drastically reducing required probabilities, handling default/distinguished states, and gracefully tolerating unobserved cues. Practical issues included whether JavaBayes supports custom G functions or whether tables must be materialized (they can be generated from G if needed).\n\nFinally, they agreed the transcription formalization must expose these feature streams and metadata: channelized, time\u2011aligned transcripts with tags (NUMS, VOC, non\u2011vocal, glosses) and scripts to convert to recognizer or linguistic formats so detectors and Bayes\u2011net combinations can be trained and evaluated consistently.",
    "System involvement in demos: the group committed to assembling demo components (Transcriber interface, prosodic visuals/X-Waves, prosody feature displays, SmartKom pipeline pieces) and to aim for an integrated illustrative demo soon. Transcriber + Snack/Tcl-TK portability and a Windows/NT presentation constraint were discussed; prosodic visualizations and static audio+image clips were proposed as practical demo alternatives to full live pipelines. Don/others will prepare signal/feature visualizations and the THISL/Transcriber front end (and possibly merge them) so demonstrable pieces can be shown locally (Professor B noted \u201cmore live is better\u201d but accepts retreating to less live for time/portability).\n\nBackups and disk/archival: Meeting Recorder data are saturating scratch disks. Options considered: hang disks on new Sun blades, add drives to Abbott, consolidate old disks, or buy new disks \u2014 but placement/room constraints require coordination with Dave Johnson. Dave recommended using NW-archive plus normal backups rather than relying on un-backed-up disks. Plan: talk to Dave to decide immediate vs. longer-term storage; CDs for distribution only (not reliable long-term backup).\n\nCollecting notes, meeting metadata and Switchboard comparisons: transcription status/tracking pages will be shared; IBM is transcribing a batch. Participant approval and \u201caudio pixelization\u201d (beep redaction) were adopted for privacy. Tools for indexing/search (THISL IR) are being wired to transcripts so queries return meeting time spans; seat/mic mapping, speaker tags and XML formats are being standardized. CrossPad/PDA markers (buttons or wireless PDAs) were discussed as lightweight in-meeting note markers; synchronization/infrastructure is a concern. Switchboard was discussed as a comparison corpus re: overlap rates; the group wants controlled two- and three-person recordings to compare overlap types.\n\nScheduling meetings going forward (professor\u2019s view): Professor B recommends alternating meeting focus (e.g., Meeting Recorder vs. recognition) or running separate focused meetings for technical topics to keep sessions relevant. He prefers small working subgroups (2\u20133 people) to get work done and urged continuing regular meetings in the short term to finish tasks like the belief\u2011net.",
    "Committee members probed why the Welsh Government stopped pursuing HMRC to run the national childcare offer. Julie Morgan said the central reason was policy flexibility: using HMRC would have constrained the Welsh offer\u2019s ability to expand (for example to include people in education/training, those \u201con the cusp\u201d of work, or cases involving immigration/no\u2011recourse status) and would have tied Wales to any changes in the England system. Officials added two practical problems: the discovery phase showed HMRC\u2019s estimated costs were substantially higher than earlier figures, and HMRC\u2019s price would mean money leaving Wales rather than being retained locally. Technical Welsh\u2011language issues were also cited\u2014HMRC can provide a bilingual service under its Welsh language scheme, but detailed compliance with Welsh Ministers\u2019 statutory language standards (including IT handling of Welsh characters and feed\u2011ins from multiple UK systems) raised unresolved concerns. Julie stressed these were not failures but learning: the HMRC work highlighted requirements and helped shape the preferred approach. The decision taken is to develop a Welsh\u2011led solution administered by local authorities (with some authorities funded to provide the admin function and an estimated current ring\u2011fenced sum of about \u00a32.5m), aiming for lower cost, greater flexibility and closer support for families. Julie expressed confidence in local authorities as partners and emphasised the need to retain investment and operational control within Wales.",
    "- Professor's comments on the workshop: he recalled past workshop experience where giving everyone access to many machines with a P-make style dispatcher often made things less efficient (everyone offloading jobs to many machines slowed the whole system); he used that example to caution about naive parallelization and to argue for sensible job management and attributes to avoid evictions and inefficiencies.\n\n- Team's feedback on the person in Grenada: the team identified a researcher in Granada (Jose Carlos Segura) working on VTS / cepstral-domain techniques. they noted his approach could be useful but warned that integrating it would force them to re-check and re\u2011optimize many other components (i.e., it requires re\u2011tuning the rest of the pipeline).\n\n- Required elements in the new form arrangement: two forms (one-time speaker form and the digits/session form); the main required fields: name, email and time (time used to locate the digits in the recording) and date; also native language, region (with \u201cOther\u201d / open field and possibly a simple region map), time spent in English-speaking countries, and a \u201cprofessional use only\u201d line. they stressed including time marks/forced-alignment info so frames can be labeled.\n\n- Suggested structure of the belief net: a layered net \u2014 observed feature nodes (prosody, verb choice, discourse cues, object/type, time of day, \u201cnice walls\u201d, admission-fee, closed, etc.) feed into a middle layer of conceptual/intent hidden nodes (tourist vs. business vs. running-an-errand, in-a-hurry, on-a-tour, want-to-enter, etc.), which then feed higher-level decision nodes (Enter / Vista / Tango / Go-there / final action). they proposed sub-regions (discourse sub\u2011net, syntactic/verb sub\u2011net) feeding into the middle layer to avoid exponential CPT explosion.\n\n- Grad B's opinion on the belief net structure: Grad B rejected the flat feature\u2192output design as unsatisfactory, supported adding an intermediate hidden layer (and even more hidden nodes) to capture intentions and reduce CPT complexity, suggested some observed nodes might also directly affect certain decisions (e.g., admission-fee \u2192 want-to-enter), and emphasized that current probabilities were ad\u2011hoc and learning/fitting to data would be needed.",
    "Grad E: He set out to evaluate mean (log\u2011magnitude) spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering for the SmartKom front end and to study how mean\u2011subtraction window length affects performance. His view was cautiously positive: using long (\u224812 s) mean windows produced only a very small drop versus matched training, which is encouraging for interactive use, but shorter test windows (2\u20136 s) do hurt if the model was trained with long windows. He therefore advocated strategies like ramping the window up over an utterance or doing a fast first pass and a longer-window second pass. On Wiener filtering he reported modest gains over the baseline (improvements depend strongly on VAD quality and dataset), found a two\u2011stage/smoothed approach reduced musical noise and improved results in some cases, and emphasized that choosing or improving the VAD (e.g., using channel\u20110 close\u2011talk VAD) was critical. He concluded outcomes were promising but incremental, dataset\u2011dependent, and in need of further tuning (latency, VAD, parameter choices).\n\nGrad A: He planned \u201ccheating\u201d experiments to probe which intermediate categories (notably voicing) actually help recognition. His goal is to force known voicing labels into the hybrid/LNA framework (zeroing posteriors for impossible phones) to measure the relative usefulness of such category information for phoneme and word recognition. He intended to run these on TIMIT (and later digits) before his quals in July. He had not reported outcomes yet \u2014 the stance is that these controlled experiments should reveal which categorical cues are most effective.",
    "The User Interface lead consistently pushed for a simple, ergonomic remote with minimal physical buttons, a clear charging stand, and an LCD touchscreen + speech interface. She favored soft/hard rubber casing in brand/fashion colours, a single S\u2011curve shape that can stand or lie flat, large readable numeric buttons, and thumb-friendly volume/channel controls (volume vertical, channels horizontal). She advocated giving older users a very small set of physical controls and hiding infrequent functions in an on\u2011screen menu or under a cover. For voice control she recommended a small microphone placement (visible/emphasised) and simple voice programming (record question/answer). On radio vs IR she personally preferred radio (RF) for direction\u2011free use but acknowledged interference concerns; she proposed frequency selection and an identification/handshake code in the signal so only the paired TV responds.\n\nThe team\u2019s final practical decision balanced UI wishes with cost and management constraints: proceed with a single\u2011curved, rubber\u2011cased remote that includes an LCD touchscreen, speech recognition capability, a charging dock and a reduced set of primary buttons (power, channel, volume). To meet the cost target they removed extra scroll buttons and simplified/flattened the shape to shave ~\u20ac2 (unit cost had been \u20ac14.60). RF was discussed but deprioritised in favor of standard IR components for cost and market expectations; RF remains a concept-level option if budget allows. Extra budget will not be spent unnecessarily \u2014 features will only be added if remaining funds permit after meeting the \u20ac12.50/unit target (hence removal of scroll buttons and shape simplification).",
    "The professor emphasized that distant-microphone noise and reverberation mainly attenuate high-frequency energy and smear temporal structure (you lose high-frequency detail and get altered temporal courses); in one example the dominant low\u2011frequency energy was air\u2011conditioning (around 5 Hz), which is easily removed. He favors doing mild high\u2011pass filtering (Feacalc/RASTA\u2011PLP has an option, roughly a ~20 Hz cutoff with mild effect up to ~100 Hz) before processing, especially with cheap mics.\n\nOn adding noise and smoothing: spectral subtraction is effective for additive noise but introduces \u201cmusical\u201d artifacts and increases variance of features (e.g., C0). That interacts poorly with on\u2011line mean/variance normalization; mean normalization before VAD or layering spectral subtraction and normalization carefully can help. Noise estimation should use nonspeech regions or histogram/EM methods over windows (500 ms\u20131 s typical); longer windows improve stationary noise estimates but add latency, and nonstationary noise requires adaptive/forgetting schemes and possibly future frames (again increasing latency). SNR\u2011dependent gain factors reduce musical noise.\n\nAbout filters: they converted FIR/LDA filters to recursive/IIR designs with the same magnitude response to cut latency (e.g., reducing delays from hundreds of ms to tens of ms). Nonlinear phase is a concern but acceptable if approximately linear at important modulation frequencies (5 Hz used for delay computation).\n\nDealing with additive noise overall: combine approaches\u2014VAD, spectral subtraction, careful normalization, possibly multistreams (envelope + fine\u2011structure/voicing detectors), or echo cancellation when close mics exist\u2014while balancing noise reduction against added variance and latency.",
    "They debated the remote\u2019s primary object as a simple, TV\u2011only controller that\u2019s original, trendy and user\u2011friendly, then weighed several function options against cost and usability. Key hardware decisions centered on casing (plastic inner shell with rubber outer grip), making it mid\u2011sized to avoid loss, and adding a docking/cradle for recharging and as a locating station (beeper/LED) \u2014 the team preferred a cradle over exotic energy harvesters. Kinetic energy options (hand dynamo, solar) were discussed but largely rejected: solar fails at night and dynamos/kinetic solutions push costs and complexity beyond the \u20ac12.50 production cap, so the project manager suggested cutting the kinetic idea for budget reasons.\n\nOn interaction, an LCD touch area was popular because it consolidates many functions into fewer physical buttons, but concerns were raised about cost and older users\u2019 acceptance. The \u201croll through favourites\u201d idea (a scroll wheel or cycling mode) came up as a strong usability/marketing feature: users could program a favourites list and roll through just those channels. Implementation proposals included a mode switch, visual indicators (LED/backlight or small display), and using the TV\u2019s on\u2011screen feedback rather than a full remote display. However, the scroll wheel carries added expense and potential responsiveness issues with different TVs; the project manager favored prioritizing the dock/design first and dropping the scroll wheel unless costs permit. In short: cradle + durable design prioritized; kinetic scrapped; favourites\u2011rolling kept as a possible software/mode feature (requiring indicators or modest display), scroll wheel optional depending on budget.",
    "The team\u2019s marketing approach centers on segmenting by user needs and appearance preferences rather than a single mass-market product. Marketing recommended pursuing an \u201cexclusive\u201d premium niche (targeting roughly 18\u201335 and other specific niches such as accessibility-focused users) rather than competing solely on low price. Proposed demographic tactics include: offering multiple casing styles/colors (metallic silvers/blacks, natural/earth tones, wood or leather-like finishes), changeable faceplates/skins to appeal to different tastes, optional upgradability (cards/modules), piloting to test variants, and considering niche variants (simplified remotes for older/disabled users). Pricing and warranty positioning (lifetime/normal-use guarantee) were discussed as part of the marketing strategy.\n\nAgreement on appearance presentations: Industrial Design and Marketing agreed to present a small range of well-defined appearance options rather than one generic look. They settled on exploring a double\u2011curved, rubberized, tactile case (durable and \u201csquishy\u201d feel), plus color/style variants (silvers/blacks and organic/wood tones) and interchangeable faceplates. Marketing will bring trend research and preferred palettes; Industrial Design will produce the basic \u201clook and feel\u201d visuals and mockups for those presentation options.\n\nIndustrial Designer\u2019s marketing proposal: prioritize fashion-forward recognizability (iPod-like appeal), focus on tactile/material differentiation (rubber, wood, leather options), add visible gimmicks (optional visible-light signalling), and choose practical power/tech (solar + backup battery). He advocated packaging changeable casings, piloting, and using voice recognition (in-house tech) as the lead technical selling point.\n\nMarketing\u2019s view of marketable aspects: they highlighted the locator/base station, favourites/scroll-wheel ergonomics, durability, voice recognition (chosen over touchscreen for cost/time), and customizable casings/colors as the strongest marketable elements.",
    "- Capturing subject intention\n  - Grad G: Positive \u2014 liked the new protocol where subjects pick high\u2011level goals beforehand and asked that those intentions be recorded so the dataset still contains \u201cground\u2011truth\u201d about whether a task is Enter/View/Approach. Thought the pre\u2011session setup would keep interactions more natural while retaining knowable intentions.\n  - The professor: Also positive but cautious \u2014 saw recording intentions as useful and necessary for the decision/Bayes\u2011net work, but stressed careful knowledge\u2011engineering (narrow decision variables) and questioned the terminology (\u201cintentions\u201d). Agreed it\u2019s feasible and important to design how intentions feed into the system.\n\n- MSG (modulation/MSG features)\n  - Grad G: no direct position recorded.\n  - The professor: Interested but cautious \u2014 acknowledged MSG/JRASTA are promising (different temporal properties) but observed MSG performed poorly on the Italian tests and may have a simple implementation bug (e.g., missing pre\u2011emphasis / normalization). Recommended treating MSG as a longer\u2011term investigation rather than a short\u2011term fix; focus first on training targets/data and practical combinations.\n\n- Pronouncing \u201czero\u201d vs \u201cO\u201d\n  - Grad G: Typically says \u201cO\u201d (it\u2019s easier).\n  - The professor: Usually says \u201czero\u201d (especially on phone); both usages were discussed and accepted as natural variants \u2014 the dataset allows either pronunciation, but the annotation/forms should make intent clear.\n\n- Hiring Fey\n  - Grad G: Supportive and pleased \u2014 acknowledged Fey\u2019s official role and offered to help recruiting/posting; happy to work with her.\n  - The professor: Strongly positive \u2014 praised Fey\u2019s work as the wizard, liked her suggestions (e.g., system self\u2011intro), and supported hiring her for organizing/subject management; expected it to be good for her training.",
    "Appearance: the Industrial Designer argued for a simple, robust, child\u2011safe look \u2014 small, not overloaded with buttons, brightly coloured or changeable trims, and clearly positioned primary keys (power, channel, volume). He supported fewer visible buttons (use multi\u2011function or hidden menus), big user\u2011friendly controls, and childproof/waterproof construction (mentioned \u201cbaby proof\u201d and that kids may chew or throw it). He also raised handedness (two switches/ambidextrous layout) and docking/charging as ways to give the remote a home and reduce loss.\n\nSpeech recognition: he liked the idea in principle (even suggested a simple voice\u2011triggered \u201cwhere is the remote?\u201d beep), but was skeptical about full speech recognition given the strict cost target and complexity. He felt speech tech was attractive for younger users but doubted it could be implemented affordably or reliably within the project budget without further research.\n\nBluetooth and other new technologies: he repeatedly noted that current remotes use infrared and warned that Bluetooth/radio would force TVs to have matching receivers (adding cost for users). He recommended against adding Bluetooth/radio for this low\u2011cost, mass\u2011market product, saying it would raise costs and complexity. Alternatives he preferred were keeping IR, using simple docks/service updates (USB/firewire or shop/software updates), rechargeable batteries or docking, and limiting receiver/communication demands so the unit stays cheap and disposable if broken.",
    "Priority of inspections: In the Estyn evidence session Jassa Scott and Janet Finch\u2011Saunders agreed the immediate inspection priority should be how the middle tier (regional consortia/local authorities) is supporting curriculum reform and driving school improvement. Scott explained consortia are not statutory bodies that Estyn can directly inspect, so Estyn will use local\u2011authority inspections and a thematic approach \u2014 first focusing on consortia support for the new curriculum, teacher development and school\u2011improvement activity \u2014 to assess impact and risks.\n\nReopening the House and diplomatic relations: Opposition members pressed for a full reopening of Parliament; ministers and the Prime Minister said the government\u2019s goal is to return to normal sittings as soon as it can be done safely, while using the hybrid model in the interim. On foreign policy, ministers stressed Canada has been active with allies (notably the US, UK and Australia) on issues such as Hong Kong and China and will continue to raise concerns multilaterally; the government insisted trade and diplomatic decisions will be made in Canadians\u2019 interests.\n\nAllocation of funds and addressing systemic racism: Justin Trudeau outlined a proposed federal fund (notably a $14\u2011billion offer to provinces for safe re\u2011opening) aimed at public\u2011health, child\u2011care and municipal supports. On systemic racism he said the response must go beyond rhetoric: invest more in communities and community\u2011based services rather than relying solely on policing, strengthen anti\u2011racism programming and data collection, and pursue substantial institutional change (including reviews/overhauls where needed, e.g. policing and justice) to tackle systemic discrimination.",
    "The group converged on a compact, hand-held remote that emphasizes a trendy, tactile \u201cfruit/vegetable\u201d aesthetic with interchangeable, squishy rubber covers (banana, broccoli, abstract \u201cblob\u201d variations) while retaining a simple push-button core. Two main material/design options were proposed: hard smooth plastic for rigidity and durability, or a soft rubber/spongy outer shell (rubber buttons) for comfort and novelty; a hybrid plastic body with rubber overmoulding was also considered. Prototypes presented included a banana-shaped scroll-like form and a round/organic mould; team members handled them to test curvature, balance, and grip.\n\nFunctional/technical design choices: a minimal, context-sensitive button set (up/down/left/right + single power/menu tap/hold) rather than many fixed buttons; IR emitter positioned at the tip/stalk; on/off switch located on the back; battery hatch on a side; suggested power options included standard batteries and a hand-crank/dynamo. Added requirements discussed: audible locator/beeper, optional backlight for dark use, lock/flip lid to prevent accidental presses, shock resistance/waterproofing as possible differentiators, and clear ease-of-battery-insertion.\n\nConstraints and next steps: strict cost target (<= \u00a312.50 production; prototype costs reported ~\u00a39.20\u2013\u00a311.90), keeping tech simple to reduce cost and development (menu programming still needed), and defining whether single-device or multi-device control. Action items: finalize materials, durability requirements, detailed button mapping and menu programming, and confirm production cost trade-offs before detailed design.",
    "The team repeatedly reviewed both the product concept and how they worked together. Process-wise they ran structured kickoff and prototype meetings, established evaluation criteria (7\u2011point scale) and used a cost spreadsheet to check whether component choices kept production under \u20ac12.50 while targeting a \u20ac25 retail price. They iterated on features (voice recognition, locator/beeper, interchangeable squishy rubber covers) and production choices (plastic gunmetal base, lithium battery, chip type, push\u2011buttons vs. scroll wheel). A final cost/profit check and decision points (battery type, number of interfaces, placement of battery hatch) were emphasized.\n\nWork division was defined: project manager (scheduling/overall), industrial designer (form/prototype), user\u2011interface (button/layout/usability), marketing (trends/user requirements). Members were to do individual tasks and reconvene to decide. However roles were fluid in practice; several members noted unclear responsibilities, uneven information access, and occasional gaps in communication\u2014PM felt out of the loop at times. Teamwork received mixed reviews: prototype-making was creative and stimulating, leadership/coordination adequate, but some felt constrained by the brief (TV\u2011only remote) and by tools (PowerPoint, digital pens, inconsistent data sharing).\n\nEvaluation and production plan outcomes: criteria scoring exposed weaknesses (ergonomics/size, usability, representation of technological features on prototype). Key action items emerged\u2014refine ergonomics (flatten vs. broccoli shape), resolve detachable cover/attachment, finalize battery/circuit choices, and re-run cost model before moving to production. Overall they felt the concept was promising but required design, usability and cost clarifications.",
    "Future directions: the group agreed to narrow and prioritize experiments before the next meeting: pick a focused set (multi\u2011band, feature combinations, VAD/LDA/RASTA integration, and multi\u2011band/TRAP-style nets), rerun nets with corrected on\u2011line normalization, and decide which combinations to test with OGI\u2019s pipeline. Short\u2011term goals include retraining nets with corrected features, testing multi\u2011band and multi\u2011stream setups, scaling feature\u2011stream variances in HTK, and choosing a small coherent set of experiments to answer core questions (language/task mismatch, training targets, resource tradeoffs). Longer\u2011term ideas: larger nets, more outputs (context/articulatory targets), regression targets, and exploring articulatory features.\n\nPhD D\u2019s explanation of the multilingual model: he trained MLPs (PLP/JRASTA/MSG/MFCC inputs) in four ways: task\u2011matched; single\u2011language broad DB (same language different task); three\u2011language DB including the task language; and three\u2011language DB excluding the task language. Results: best when trained on task data; switching to different single\u2011language broad data costs ~10% relative; adding multilingual broad data worsened performance further (~~20% more); excluding English made little difference. He emphasized on\u2011line normalization bugs, that MLP outputs can overfit task\u2011specific decision boundaries (losing transferable info), and proposed more outputs or articulatory/soft targets to reduce task/language specificity.\n\nPhD C / professor discussion on multiple languages: PhD C wanted multilingual training explored; professor noted observed language vs task effects, questioned label/alignment quality and single\u2011net vs multiple\u2011net strategies, and suggested articulatory or multi\u2011class/context\u2011dependent outputs as remedies. They stressed lack of sufficient data/parameters as a likely cause of multilingual degradation.\n\nReleasing meeting data / cut\u2011outs: grads circulated consent forms and proposed July 15 release. Policy discussion: allow participants a finite review window (suggested ~1\u20132 weeks) to request deletions/bleeps; if no reply, presume consent (but attorneys advise keeping an electronic record of acknowledgement). Practical steps: follow\u2011up email reminders, track accesses/logs, callers for non\u2011responders, and physically remove/bleep agreed segments before public release.",
    "Ms. Jenny Kwan\u2019s remark points to a recurring problem she highlights across the hearings: governments can announce policy programs quickly, but there is often a substantive gap before those programs actually help people. She\u2019s saying that program design (the public announcement, eligibility rules and intent) is occurring faster than practical delivery (administration, outreach, eligibility fixes and payments), so vulnerable groups slip through the cracks.\n\nIn the transcript she illustrates this with concrete examples: single parents who lost spousal/child support are still not receiving relief despite ministers \u201clooking into it\u201d; urban Indigenous communities in Vancouver East receiving under 2% of pandemic housing funding; people whose mailed Service Canada documents sat unopened for months; and fishers, charities or family-run businesses shut out by eligibility rules. Those examples show failures in coordination, administrative capacity, communication, and program rules that weren\u2019t adapted to real-world circumstances.\n\nImplications: delayed or unequal access to benefits, increased hardship for those most vulnerable, and loss of public trust. Implicitly, Kwan is urging faster operational follow-through\u2014clearer implementation plans, targeted fixes for known gaps, interdepartmental and provincial coordination, simplified or flexible eligibility, and proactive outreach\u2014so that policy commitments translate quickly and equitably into actual support.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) described the last meeting review as a coherent recap: presentations by the designers and researchers led to the decision to develop a voice\u2011recognition, non\u2011traditional shaped remote with a slide\u2011out bay and reduced buttons. The PM felt the review had captured limitations, risks and key choices (e.g., no touchscreen) and believed the team had incorporated those points into the prototype. Regarding market research, the PM acknowledged the findings (younger users willing to pay, preference for simpler/modern appearance) but judged some features (full speech recognition, solar cells) probably not worth the immediate investment.\n\nWhen reflecting on the meetings and project progress the PM said they\u2019d \u201cslipped into\u201d the role, got very engaged, and intended to assemble minutes/final report. They perceived their presentation content as adequate for an overview: timely information that filled gaps, clear decisions on scope and components, and a workable product direction despite budget constraints.\n\nThe group\u2019s view diverged because members experienced practical problems the PM downplayed: later presentations lacked detail or slides (some slides were blank), information declined over the day, time/room constraints limited collaboration, and tasks overlapped. Team members therefore felt communication and deliverables were inconsistent, whereas the PM took a more programmatic, optimistic overview. That difference in perspective \u2014 PM\u2019s high\u2011level synthesis versus members\u2019 focus on missing details and execution pain points \u2014 explains the disagreement.\n\nOn the panther drawing: reactions were mixed. one person liked the idea, but several thought a panther would be hard to draw (compared to a spider) and joked about its behavior; overall the group leaned toward it being impractical as a simple whiteboard sketch.",
    "The team largely converged on a hybrid, user-friendly concept:\n\n- Buttons for multiple operations: the group argued against overloading single buttons with many modes. Marketing and UI stressed one-button/one-function wherever possible to shorten the learning curve, especially for older or non-technical users. A few engineering ideas for mode-based buttons were kept as optional (for fewer visible keys), but tactile distinction and clear labelling were prioritized.\n\n- LCD screen: there was clear consensus to include an LCD (advanced chip required). Preferred approach was a protected flip-open design: a minimalist outer remote with essential physical buttons, and an inner LCD/menu plus a scroll/spinner for advanced navigation. Debate focused on size and placement (top vs bottom), but most favoured keeping the LCD inside when closed and large enough to avoid accidental touches when open. Menus would hold less-used functions; common tasks remain physical.\n\n- Microphone position: voice recognition was accepted as a desirable differentiator. The mic should be visible and prominent to signal its importance; practical suggestions put it on the front/bottom area (near where the hand holds it) or in a clearly marked spot so users know it\u2019s present and accessible.\n\n- Push-buttons: the team wants push-buttons retained for core functions\u2014power, volume, channel up/down, numeric entry\u2014since this is the company\u2019s strength and critical for ease-of-use. Push-buttons should be tactile (different shapes/sizes), backlit/fluorescent for dark use, and grouped ergonomically to reduce RSI risk. Less-used controls move to the LCD/menu.",
    "The tourism sector was among the first and hardest hit by COVID\u201119. Key challenges cited in the meetings included:\n- Near\u2011total collapse of international and interprovincial recreational travel due to border closures and public\u2011health restrictions, plus an outright ban on cruise ships for the season. Examples: Atlantic ports lost dozens of calls (e.g., PEI projected ~97 ship visits / 154,000 passengers and ~$60M lost; Saint John ~79 ships / 270,000 passengers).  \n- Closure or long suspension of festivals, concert halls, fairgrounds and other event venues, jeopardizing year\u2011round and seasonal operators and supply chains.  \n- Large revenue losses for small, rural and seasonal businesses and for the ~1.8 million Canadians employed by the industry.  \n- Uncertainty about timing and health/safety criteria for reopening, which impeded operators\u2019 ability to plan and retool.\n\nGovernment measures to mitigate the impact:\n- Broad business supports available to tourism firms: Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) loans, and Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) \u2014 intended to preserve payrolls and liquidity.  \n- Sector\u2011specific/targeted supports and regional measures: announcements of funding for tourism recovery (ministers referenced roughly $70M targeted support and ACOA/top\u2011ups for Atlantic Canada), Destination Canada and Destination Marketing Organization supports to drive a \u201cvisit local\u201d rebound, and regional RDAs working with industry.  \n- Cultural/arts funding ($500M program and advances via Canada Council/Heritage) to help venues and festivals.  \n- Transport/health policy actions: cruise restrictions for safety, and calls for clear reopening criteria and health/safety guidance so operators can prepare.\n\nWitnesses repeatedly urged clearer timelines/criteria for border reopening and faster, more tailored financial help for small and seasonal tourism operators.",
    "Presentation: team framed the problem as existing remotes being ugly, over-cluttered and hard to learn. Research showed users want fewer controls, strong aesthetics and novelty; younger buyers receptive to voice, older less so. Key component diagram (battery \u2192 chip \u2192 transistor/amplifier \u2192 IR LED \u2192 TV) and user-flow (button/voice \u2192 chip \u2192 IR signal) were shown.\n\nDiscussion: design settled on a recognisable, fashionable, ergonomically hand\u2011shaped form (mouse/hairbrush hybrid) with organic curves, corporate logo, and cheap interchangeable covers to support fashion-led repeat purchases. Materials: lightweight molded plastic body with rubbery stretch-on covers. Controls: minimal physical controls \u2014 large power, channel up/down, a side volume scroll/slider, a menu/enter action and numeric entry for tuning/favourites. Menu and advanced settings would be shown on the TV (no onboard LCD). A \u201cfind my remote\u201d function (clap/whistle or simple remote ping) was discussed as high\u2011value. Voice recognition was viewed as strategically important but technically risky and costly.\n\nComponents and energy source: electronics include an integrated circuit chip, resonator/diode/transistor, resistors/capacitors and IR emitter; microphone and voice-processing required for voice features. Energy decision: commit to a sealed, long\u2011life power solution (aiming at a 5\u201310 year lifetime and \u201cguaranteed for life\u201d positioning); options considered were long-life battery possibly augmented by small solar harvesting and a backup cell.\n\nDecision and prototype: product will be TV\u2011only, prioritize time\u2011to\u2011market and core functionality. Team agreed to pursue a custom chip to enable voice but constrain features to control cost and schedule. Prototype mockups show the ergonomic shape, IR emitter across the top, side volume roller, channel buttons, large power key and interchangeable rubber covers.",
    "Decision on DARPA:\nThe group committed to deliver demonstrable material for the mid\u2011July DARPA meeting. They decided the demo should include the transcriber interface plus a second demonstration (a mock\u2011up question\u2011answer/retrieval or similar pre\u2011stored QA task). Action items: finalize which demo(s) to prioritize, finish segmentation/beeped audio generation (digits spliced with beeps), send one more sample meeting through the segmentation/transcription pipeline to estimate turnaround, resolve transcription approval/consent wording so a subset of data can be publicly offered at DARPA, and push the system toward \u201cproduction mode\u201d (a continuous stream and measurable performance). They also plan limited hiring to maintain a small, flexible transcription staff.\n\nContents of the paper:\nThree main sections: (1) overlap analysis across four corpora (Meeting Recorder, Robustness meetings, Switchboard, CallHome) using word counts and \u201cspurts\u201d (speech stretches with no pauses >500 ms); (2) evaluation of how overlap affects ASR performance and how scoring only foreground regions changes error; (3) analysis of interruptions (locations where secondary speakers start) using lexical tags (backchannels, discourse markers, filled pauses, disfluencies) and preliminary classifier work combining prosodic and word features.\n\nStatistics included:\n- Corpus inventory: ~62 hours collected so far.\n- Overlap: Meeting Recorder meetings show the most overlap (~17\u201318% of words); Robustness meetings about half that (~8\u201310%); Switchboard and CallHome are similar to each other. Removing backchannels reduces overlap modestly (example: Switchboard from ~14% to ~11%).\n- Spurt definition: pauses >500 ms.\n- ASR: when scoring only foreground regions (ignoring background overlap), recognition error drops nearly to the non\u2011overlapped level \u2014 indicating most additional errors are insertions from background speech.\n- Pitch/prosody: pitch features are more reliable here than in Switchboard due to close\u2011talk mics; preliminary classifiers show both word and prosodic features are predictive.",
    "They agreed to run comparisons of their current recognizer on a standard digits test (TI\u2011digits) so results are directly comparable \u2014 either by running the exact system on TI\u2011digits or by adapting TI\u2011digits to their naming/speaker conventions (they can fake waveform/speaker IDs or modify the parsing script). They noted TI\u2011digits is wideband/studio-recorded while their digits are room recordings (closer mics but harder acoustically), and that telephone\u2011bandwidth front-ends and VTL/speaker adaptation behavior must be considered (VTL needs enough data per speaker).\n\nCurrent technique and limitations:\n- Tandem approach (MLP outputs + HTK) and SRI recognizer variants; starting from Switchboard models then doing supervised adaptation (means/variances) and VTL estimation. Adaptation yields nontrivial gains; variance adaptation small.\n- Forced\u2011alignment improvements: relaxed pruning, continuity constraints for foreground speaker, noise/reject models, proximity penalties \u2014 but need hand\u2011marked alignments to tune.\n- Limitations: HTK baseline much worse than SRI in some conditions; pipeline not flexible (must dump feature files); MLPs trained on mismatched languages/tasks often hurt performance; feature normalization/on\u2011line normalization bugs; limited network capacity vs. increased diverse training data.\n\nProgress:\n- Microphone comparisons done (lapel performed well), adaptation tests run, forced\u2011alignment scripts and CTM outputs produced, many MLP experiments across PLP/MSG/JRASTA/multi\u2011band underway, and on\u2011line normalization issues identified and being fixed.\n\nDelays and causes:\n- Equipment/mike problems, people\u2019s schedules (travel, children), debugging (on\u2011line normalization bug), retraining nets after fixes, and general scope (many experiments) have pushed timelines. They plan to narrow experiments and prioritize what to run before the next deadline.",
    "- Name: The team preferred \"Triple R\" over \"Triple RC\" because it looked cleaner and more brandable on packaging. Keeping only \"Triple R\" avoided the literal/awkward reading that \"RC\" makes it look like \u201ctriple remote control,\u201d reduced visual clutter, and preserved a simpler, catchier image (marketing also suggested using a dash if needed).\n\n- Target age group and why: They concluded the product should target younger users \u2014 roughly 15\u201335 (with particular emphasis around 20\u201335 / 25\u201335 as the core paying, gadget-adopting group). The reasons were that this group are early adopters, more tech\u2011savvy, comfortable with new interfaces (computers/phones), likely to value fashionable design, and have some disposable income to buy an aftermarket remote.\n\n- Why marketing targeted young people: Marketing argued young people adopt new devices first, are more willing to pay for stylish and intuitive gadgets, are receptive to optional advanced features (e.g., voice recognition), and fit the company\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d positioning. Targeting them maximizes appeal for trend-led design and optional high\u2011tech features.\n\n- Selection of channels (functionality discussion summary): The team prioritized basic channel functions (channel up/down, numeric channel entry, favorite\u2011channel shortcuts and a \u201czap\u201d fast\u2011flip behavior). Advanced functions (audio/display settings, TV guide, previews) were to be tucked into an LCD menu to keep the front panel simple. They debated numeric entry vs. favorites/cycling, considered an LCD for showing channels/menus, and noted speech control could allow voice channel selection but is costly and optional. Overall: keep habitual channel controls immediately accessible, hide complex features in the menu, and offer favorites/quick\u2011zap for typical use.",
    "Their market research (100 users + trend reports) showed aesthetics matter most: \u201cfancy\u201d look-and-feel is twice as important as being technologically innovative, which in turn is twice as important as pure ease-of-use. Findings: most people use only ~10% of buttons, many (especially 15\u201335 year\u2011olds) would pay for advanced features like speech recognition, and fashion trends favor vivid \u201cfruit/vegetable\u201d colours and spongy materials.\n\nDesired features discussed\n- Core functions kept minimal: power, channel, volume, an Enter/menu access and simple macros (one\u2011button sequences).\n- Finder feature (beeper/radio ping from a TV\u2011mounted sender) to locate lost remotes.\n- Flip/top concept: LCD graphic area on the flip top for GUI; rubberised, anti\u2011RSI buttons on the lower half.\n- Personalisation: removable rubber sleeves/skins in vibrant colours and textures.\n- Power: debate between AA/AAA, kinetic (watch-type cell), solar and internal rechargeable; consensus leaned to batteries/kinetic as most feasible now.\n- Optional ideas: iPod\u2011style scroll wheel or fuller GUI (more expensive chip) and speech recognition \u2014 attractive but costly.\n\nDesign opinions\n- Prefer ergonomic, biomorphic shape; small, stylish, hand\u2011friendly.\n- Trade-offs: spongy/rubbery casing conflicts with delicate LCD/scroll hardware; titanium expensive and impractical.\n- Keep a standard central volume/channel cluster for familiarity.\n\nNecessity of revolution\n- Group felt the product should \u201creimagine\u201d the remote (fewer buttons, stronger aesthetics, a home/dock) rather than pursue a full technological revolution.

    "- Quality assurance plan (Kirsty Williams AM): she said any new PCET commission must have a coherent, effective and comprehensive QA regime that protects Welsh universities' reputation and remains compatible with ENQA. She has listened to stakeholders about a single QA body but will not weaken standards; options include greater synergy between Estyn/QAA roles, enhanced assurance for work\u2011based and transnational activity, and retaining high standards while exploring a single-framework approach in forthcoming legislation rather than imposing sudden change.\n\n- Bethan Owen on the \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d categorisation: she emphasised the critical mitigations against institutions moving into the high\u2011risk band \u2013 keeping Welsh universities attractive to students (including recruiting from England and internationally) and sustaining research capacity/investment, both of which support income and economic benefits.\n\n- The five principles for reopening schools (Kirsty Williams): (1) pupil and staff safety, physical and emotional wellbeing; (2) decisions taken in the context of the wider public\u2011health response; (3) clear evidence\u2011based communication to secure parents\u2019 and staff\u2019s confidence and allow planning; (4) prioritisation of which groups should return if phased; (5) practical operational issues (workforce, social\u2011distancing in settings and transport, avoiding crowding at gates) must be resolved.\n\n- Expectations for exams and school qualifications: exams were cancelled; Qualifications Wales will use teacher\u2011assessed grades informed by teachers\u2019 evidence and professional judgment, with centre\u2011to\u2011centre and national moderation to ensure fairness. Vocational/competency elements may be delayed where industry certification is required; specific guidance has been published.\n\n- On doubts about sufficiency of actions: she repeatedly defended the approach \u2014 stressing use of remit letters, outcome agreements, soft and graduated regulatory powers for a new commission, trust in HEFCW\u2019s professional judgment but readiness to require full intervention if necessary, and a commitment to reflect findings in post\u2011legislative reform.",
    "Likes\n- Creative control: team liked being able to decide technological sophistication and the fashionable look (branding as a \u201cfashion-forward\u201d product).\n- Ergonomics and aesthetics: they praised the curvature/concave bottom, \u201cthumb-shaped\u201d buttons, overall hand feel, and the trendy \u201ccookie-like\u201d appearance.\n- Functionality goals: enthusiasm for voice recognition, lighting feedback for all buttons, side channel/volume layout, and choosing lithium batteries to support advanced features.\n- Tools and collaboration: positive comments about laptops, wireless networking, shared files, and the novelty of the digital pens; overall teamwork was viewed as productive and fun.\n- Commercial potential: confidence that the product could sell and was within budget.\n\nDislikes / Concerns\n- Scope restrictions: frustration that the company limited them to designing only a TV remote, which stifled creativity.\n- Prototype limitations: materials and the clay mockup didn\u2019t reflect intended finishes (missing black labeling, no reflection of voice features), making it hard to assess ease of use.\n- Usability doubts: some rated \u201ceasy to use\u201d low (a 2), indicating uncertainty about the interface and button/layout clarity.\n- Unresolved design/production questions: ambiguity about whether to include two or three interfaces/scrolls, manufacturing feasibility of certain curves, and how to represent some tech features on the prototype.\n- Minor process annoyances: the survey and some tools were described as irritating or of unclear utility.",
    "They were using mean-subtraction (subtracting a long-time average spectrum) as a form of channel/room normalization in the SRI/Aurora experiments and debating why it helps in some systems but hurts in others. Observations:\n- Mean subtraction can act like channel normalization and possibly explain why HTK with this front end improved on Aurora baseline, while the SRI system (which already does channel adaptation) sometimes worsened, especially on near\u2011mic PZM data.\n- Re-synthesis after subtracting long (up to ~12 s) averages can introduce reverberation\u2011like artifacts and pre/post\u2011echoes that misalign phones and hurt training. Listeners noted audible echoes in some re\u2011synthesized signals.\n- Mean subtraction made some PZM signals sound louder post\u2011processing; this might be changing SNR or interacting with absolute\u2011energy dependent features. If level changes affect both training and test equally, they should cancel, but mismatches can matter.\n\nExperiments and hypotheses:\n- Phase-mean subtraction initially failed (phase averaging issues). They tried taking the mean FFT (no log), extracting its phase and subtracting that as a normalization; reversing prior steps helped.\n- Alternatives discussed: high\u2011pass filtering (Hirsch/Avendano/Hermansky) which effectively removes low\u2011energy reverberant components, explicit VAD-based zeroing of low\u2011energy frames, different normalization time constants, and ensuring normalization is applied consistently in training and test.\nNext steps: train on larger/more varied data to make models robust to artifacts, test SRI models with different training sets (Macrophone vs TI\u2011digits), try gender\u2011dependent models, and explore VAD/HPF and smoothing/time\u2011constant choices for mean subtraction.",
    "Mixed signals: the group debated using mixed (staggered/multi\u2011channel) versus single channel views for transcription and alignment. Mixed audio is useful for spotting overlap and dominant turns; transcribers should listen to mixed signal first and only switch to individual channels for ambiguous/overlap regions. Channelized presegmentation (Thilo) helps but merging adjacent chunks and hand\u2011checking remains necessary; forced alignment in heavy overlap/lapel channels is still problematic.\n\nVAD improvements: several approaches discussed \u2014 a small neural\u2011net VAD using noise\u2011compensated MFCCs + LDA (nine\u2011frame context) and alternatives based on energy ratios (clean vs. pre\u2011clean) across bands to reduce latency. Suggestions to reduce VAD latency (current ~220\u2013270 ms) by moving delta computations before online normalization, shrinking windows, and shaving ~20 ms. Also ideas to feed VAD flags into the tandem neural net or post\u2011modify net outputs, and to explore FFT\u2013envelope difference features as voiced/unvoiced cues.\n\nVAD results: the new VAD gives large error reductions in well\u2011matched and medium mismatch conditions (single\u2011digit to several tens of percent relative improvement cited), approaching earlier \u201ccheating\u201d VAD performance (\u224860% improvement reported for best cases). However the tandem net with added features sometimes worsened highly\u2011mismatched performance (notably more deletions), producing small overall net gains on corpora like SpeechDat\u2011Car.\n\nPostdoc A on headphones: postdoc A bought new headphones; transcribers prefer them (more comfortable, better for work), expect fewer corrections. They recommended ordering several spares for transcription work.\n\nAlternative ways to increase space: archive and move regeneratable data (Broadcast News P\u2011files, Aurora static data) to tape/backups, relocate data to other backed\u2011up disks, use remote rooms or portable recording rigs (wheelable or tabletop mics) if IBM hardware becomes available, or ask partners to record at ICSI to reduce transfer/storage needs. New internal disks are planned.\n\nDeadline: data release set for July 15. Group recommends an explicit response window (suggestion: two weeks / July 1 cutoff) and a reminder email; email acknowledgement should be captured and followed up by phone/administration for non\u2011responders.",
    "Special schools in the \u201cnew purpose\u201d arrangements (i.e. provision for vulnerable pupils and children of key workers during closures) are expected to remain central providers: vulnerable pupils who normally attend special schools should be supported in their usual settings wherever possible, rather than being moved to different sites, because of the nature of their needs. Many special-school pupils were already being kept away from mainstream attendance for health reasons, so local authorities and schools are directed to plan bespoke, age\u2011appropriate activities and safeguarding checks; headteachers retain professional discretion about opening/closing and which pupils to accommodate.\n\nOn PDG for looked\u2011after children (LAC PDG) the Government moved to a more regional, strategic model. Rather than simply transferring money with the child to a school (which risked disappearing when children moved), regions now have LAC PDG coordinators and may deploy funds for individual pupils, for targeted school interventions, or for system\u2011level capacity building (examples: attachment training, nurture groups, counselling). Regional consortia and newly appointed regional PDG advisers are responsible for challenging schools on PDG use, ensuring evidence-based practice, and evaluating impact. An external evaluation (ICF) and Welsh Government scrutiny of local/regional allocations are underway.\n\nIn short: special schools should continue to provide direct support to their vulnerable/LAC pupils; LAC PDG is managed regionally to secure strategic, consistent support (which can include supporting special schools), while consortia/advisers monitor and challenge both school\u2011level and regional deployment to drive effective outcomes.",
    "They introduced the prototype as a single\u2011handed, ergonomically moulded device: the industrial designer walked the team through form and function (moulded to the palm, left side for volume, right side for channel up/down, prominent power key, infrared emitter and LED indicators, holes for buttons and a rubber cover), the user\u2011interface designer described materials and feel (lightweight plastic body with stretchable, spongy rubber covers like iPod sleeves, logo placement, LED in a ring), and the project manager confirmed the concept met the design brief and evaluation criteria and raised production/finance points (double\u2011curved case cost, chip choice, voice sensor cost but required). They also discussed practical details: making it stand upright by widening the base, interchangeable casings (fruit/vegetable colour themes), anti\u2011RSI comfort, a locator/alarm (beep/flash), and options like rechargeable batteries/docking station or kinetic charging.\n\nOn universality they were cautious. The industrial designer explained that a true universal remote would need the processor to send different protocol \u201cMorse\u2011code\u201d signals per brand, increasing complexity and cost. The project manager and UI lead agreed the market/technology and memory constraints make full universality difficult without significant cost (advanced chips, larger PCB, more memory). They proposed compromises: support common/popular functions across TVs, programmable or learnable codes for main buttons, interchangeable covers for language/region, research whether TVs share menu standards, and investigate chip options (simple vs. advanced). No final decision was made\u2014action items were to research protocol compatibility, chip costs, and feasibility of a limited/universal feature set.",
    "The Industrial Designer repeatedly stressed that appearance and tactile feel are key selling points. He proposed a biomorphic, single\u2011curved \u201chand\u2011shaped\u201d case (initially bright blue with yellow buttons and a fluorescent\u2011green menu LED) that fits comfortably in one hand and lets users reach everything with the thumb. He advocated raised, soft rubber buttons for frequent touch, larger/clearly labelled volume controls, and one or two special\u2011form buttons as visual accents. He recommended colourful, eye\u2011catching styling (fruit/vegetable theme options, changeable covers) to attract younger, trend\u2011driven buyers, while also proposing a large\u2011button module variant for older users.\n\nStructurally he argued for a strong, recyclable plastic case (titanium was discussed as premium alternative), simple push\u2011button electronics on an inexpensive PCB, and modular design: detachable add\u2011ons for speech recognition, parental control, large\u2011button kit, charger, or LCD. He described internal wiring, switches, and a robust build (bleeper to locate lost remotes); later prototypes explored a 360\u00b0 jog/joystick control and microphone placement. He emphasized durability (must withstand drops) and manufacturability (covers and skins to keep costs down).\n\nOn customer preferences he echoed market research: consumers buy on look/feel in store, so \u201cfanciness\u201d and comfort outrank raw functionality at point\u2011of\u2011sale. Young buyers want trendy, customizable designs; older buyers want simplicity and clear labelling. He supported modularity to let different customers pay for only the features they want and recommended user testing with varied age/socio\u2011economic groups to refine appearance, controls and ergonomics.",
    "- $75 million allocation (sexual exploitation / human trafficking): According to the transcript, the government has launched a new comprehensive national strategy to combat human trafficking that includes an \u201cempowerment\u201d pillar. The $75M (referenced by MPs) is being channelled to frontline organizations and supports across the country. Ministers replied that \u201chundreds\u201d of organizations have already received support and that more announcements were forthcoming; at one point officials indicated roughly 700 centres/shelters/organizations have received funds or are being funded, with additional disbursements to follow. The government emphasized multiple delivery routes and that more details would be announced soon, while acknowledging some groups (e.g., Battered Women\u2019s Support Services and many sexual assault/shelter groups) were still awaiting direct funding.\n\n- \u201cRisk appetite\u201d solution (HE/finance oversight context): HEFCW\u2019s officials described their remedy as intensified oversight rather than blunt prohibition. Key elements: strengthened monitoring (regular five\u2011year forecasts and scenario stress\u2011testing), requiring institutions to prepare no\u2011growth contingency plans, targeted engagement with higher\u2011risk institutions, tighter scrutiny/consent for major borrowings, tools and data to help governors challenge executives, and promotion of independent governance reviews. The approach is proactive oversight, constructive challenge and early intervention to curb imprudent risk\u2011taking.\n\n- Hon. Chrystia Freeland on systemic racism: Freeland acknowledged the seriousness and complexity of systemic racism and said it is not a simple problem to solve, but she explicitly condemned racial profiling as unacceptable. She framed responses as requiring sustained work with provinces, communities and institutions and signalled federal willingness to engage on reforms (while stressing collaboration with provincial jurisdictions).",
    "Thilo\u2019s segmenter is now working well and has been adopted as the preferred pre\u2011segmentation source. The team explicitly wants to move recognition experiments off hand\u2011segmentations and onto these automatic segmentations to avoid \u201ccheating.\u201d Recent activity: Thilo has run his segmenter on another sample meeting (one more meeting will be sent to the transcribers), and the plan is to check whether that segmentation fixes the \u201ctoo many beeps\u201d problem seen in the last transcription. Transcribers strongly prefer having Thilo\u2019s pre\u2011segmentations \u2014 they speed work and have been switched back on when available; when transcribers start partway through a meeting the group merges manual work with the automatic segments. \n\nCharacteristics and implications: the segmenter has high recall and tends to over\u2011generate (lower precision). The team views that as acceptable because over\u2011generation can be handled by training noise/transient models in the recognizer and by cutting out spurious regions. They want tighter boundaries/hand\u2011checked ground truth for some experiments and are discussing producing records (diffs) of where transcribers change boundaries so performance can be measured. Turnaround on the new segmentation/transcription round is not yet firm; they hope to resolve workflow and move toward production before the mid\u2011July DARPA meeting. Overall status: functioning and helpful, being integrated into the pipeline, with evaluation and minor tweaks (boundary tightening, comparison to manual edits) ongoing.",
    "They disagreed on price because each role was using a different lens. The UI designer worried about hidden development costs (programming the novel menu system, voice/speech work and user\u2011testing) and so rated price sensitivity higher; the industrial designer focused on simple, low\u2011cost materials and manufacturability (hard plastic/rubber mix) and therefore expected low unit cost. Marketing, however, pushed the \u201chot trends\u201d agenda (LCD, special colours, customisation, solar/extra features) and income targets (retail margin and company profit goals), showing that adding those trend features would raise per\u2011unit cost toward the budget cap\u2014so marketing argued more conservatively about keeping price down.\n\nThe UI designer resisted the \u201cno redesign\u201d decision after product evaluation because they feared releasing an under\u2011tested first generation would cause a market flop. They wanted time for iterative user testing and fine\u2011tuning (menus, ergonomics, programming) to ensure the product actually met diverse user requirements, rather than shipping an unvalidated design and hoping for a second\u2011generation fix.\n\nThe UI pushed yellow (and red accents) because those choices tied directly to the fruit/organic trend and the company\u2019s identity: bright, attention\u2011getting, youthful \u201cfruit\u201d colours (banana/pineapple inspiration), high visibility and strong branding (yellow with black buttons was repeatedly flagged as the company palette).\n\nMarketing disagreed with the UI on shape because their priorities were different: distinctiveness and sellability balanced with usability, robustness and production cost. They worried exaggerated banana/fruit shapes or complex curves would be fragile, harder/cheaper to manufacture, confusing for some users (zapping, pockets, one\u2011hand use) or off\u2011putting in some segments, so they pushed for shapes that balanced trendiness with practicality.",
    "Dafydd Evans: He believes the Welsh baccalaureate\u2019s aim to improve employment skills is sound but its implementation has lost clarity. Employers, parents and learners largely do not understand what the qualification means; the title is unhelpful. Evans highlights a mismatch of priorities (e.g. GCSE resits) that reduces uptake at levels 1\u20132 and limits time for employability work. He argues for a review with stronger employer ownership, closer, coordinated links between industry and schools/colleges, and better contextualisation by vocational staff so the qualification more clearly develops workforce-relevant skills.\n\nKay Martin: She is broadly positive that where the baccalaureate is well delivered it can help prepare learners for work, especially at level 3, but stresses it is not right for everyone. Many students arrive needing GCSE resits or basic literacy/numeracy, so the bac can be too burdensome or repetitive. In her college other employer-linked programmes (Career Ready, internships, WorldSkills) often engage employers more effectively and deliver clearer employment benefits than the Welsh bac. She favours reducing paperwork, increasing experiential learning, and ensuring vocational lecturers contextualise delivery.\n\nNick Brazil: He views the bac as having started with a good vision but becoming overly rigorous, bureaucratic and outcome-driven, which can detract from genuine skill development. Employer boards seldom understand or ask for the bac; employers question whether it develops the professional skills they need. He warns that forcing the bac on learners can be counterproductive and that existing enhanced vocational programmes often link with industry more directly. He supports revisiting the qualification to refocus on practical employability outcomes.",
    "The team added several practical ideas and presented complementary concepts for function and working design:\n\nCore functions and layout\n- Keep basics: power, numeric keypad (0\u20139), channel up/down, volume, mute. Group controls into three buckets (habitual/always-accessed, occasional, advanced) with a single menu button to access less-used functions.\n- Favourites list and \u201czapping\u201d via a scroll wheel (scroll-only) to speed channel surfing.\n- Large, ergonomic primary buttons (esp. power); rubber-covered keys and a compact, fashionable form (silvers/blacks) to match corporate branding and slogan.\n\nFind/charging and physical design\n- Cradle/base station with charge contacts and a remote-locate/beacon (\u201cwhere\u2019s my remote\u201d) button; LED/indicator bulb for feedback.\n- Rechargeable base considered but batteries preferred unless power draw (e.g., voice) becomes large.\n- Prototype details: green scroll, white plastic body with red rubber grips; concerns about wheel activation when dropped and possible trigger/button placements to prevent accidental input.\n\nElectronics, modularity and transmission\n- Smart chip for universal/simple device logic; infra\u2011red selected as low-risk transmission for time-to-market but line\u2011of\u2011sight limits noted if voice input requires close use.\n- Upgradability considered (modular card/firmware) so advanced features (voice recognition, device multiplexing) can be optional add-ons.\n\nMarket/constraints\n- Marketing research: users want simpler, attractive remotes and are willing to pay more for perceived quality; target 15\u201335 (young professionals). New project constraints: TV-only control, drop teletext, include corporate color/slogan, and stay within cost targets (production ~\u20ac15\u201316).",
    "The Project Manager stressed an international market focus (Europe, North America, etc.) and a broad consumer target \u2014 essentially adults with some disposable income (he suggested \u201cunder about sixty\u201d) while still keeping usability for older users in mind. He set hard financial constraints: a retail price of \u20ac25, maximum production cost \u20ac12.50, and an ultimate profit target of \u20ac50M (implying on the order of ~4 million units at \u20ac12.50 profit each). He repeatedly emphasized that these numbers must drive design choices and procurement (bulk buying, off\u2011the\u2011shelf components).\n\nRegarding Marketing\u2019s proposed new features, the PM was positive about differentiation (multi\u2011device capability, LCD/menu, locator transmitter, programmable sounds) but cautious on feasibility and cost. He noted LCDs, joysticks and menu functionality need more powerful (and more expensive) chips; USB/computer programming is attractive but could push cost too far; IR multi\u2011device control is workable but may require room-side devices and careful implementation. He favored using standard components (e.g., lithium\u2011ion batteries), minimizing exotic extras (avoid embedding TVs, etc.), and replacing a numeric keypad with menu traversal where possible to save cost.\n\nOn the multipurpose remote: he thought it feasible if kept minimal and using standard parts, but warned complexity and advanced chips would raise unit cost. He insisted on setting the selling/volume targets to inform marketing strategy and component choices. For the next steps he assigned individual functional design work, tighter UI/industrial collaboration for conceptual/detailed design, asked everyone to save work in the shared folder, and to reconvene to review functional designs.",
    "User Interface accepted the project's headline cost constraints and financial targets but was pragmatic about trade-offs. They repeatedly referenced the numbers: a target retail price of about \u20ac25 and a maximum production cost of \u20ac12.50, noting the team would need to sell roughly four million units to meet profit goals. They questioned whether overheads were fully accounted for and flagged that a nominal margin (project team estimated ~50% profit before overheads) might not cover all costs, so any budget increase would likely require a higher sale price.\n\nOn kinetic batteries, User Interface was unconcerned that customers would demand them: they said customers never mentioned the battery, and that visible attributes (shape, colours, feel) mattered more. Accordingly they were open to replacing the kinetic solution with standard batteries if that improved cost feasibility. They supported treating voice recognition and other costly options as optional/upgraded extras (e.g., a business-class version) rather than core features, so the baseline product could meet the \u20ac12.50 cost cap. Finally, they recommended complying with head-office specifications for the baseline model while documenting recommendations (like kinetic charging or voice recognition) for higher-end variants.",
    "They disagreed because they were prioritizing different constraints and user needs, so proposed \u201cnice-to-have\u201d ideas conflicted with technical, ergonomic and cost realities.\n\nMarketing pushed features (kinetic power, upgradability/card slots, more functions) as selling points to differentiate the product and support future revenue. They saw docking/upgradeability and novel power sources as marketable hooks.\n\nThe Industrial Designer (and engineering/project manager) pushed back on feasibility, usability and cost. Key objections were:\n- Energy trade-offs: the planned LCD (and optional voice recognition) needs steady power; kinetic charging (shake-to-power) was judged impractical\u2014especially for the target users (elderly who wouldn\u2019t want to shake the remote). Solar/kinetic would increase part count and cost (multiple cells), threatening the \u20ac12.50 production-cost cap.\n- Usability/ergonomics: adding upgradability or extra buttons complicates the simple interface that elderly users need; extra controls could make the remote harder to use and defeat the product\u2019s core simplicity.\n- Manufacturing/warranty risk: making it upgradable implies more hardware complexity, higher production cost, different casing/parts (and possible redesigns), and changes to warranty policies\u2014raising risk and expense.\n- Aesthetics vs function: marketing\u2019s desire for fashionable options (wood covers, changeable cases) also raised costs and manufacturing complexity.\n\nIn short, marketing favored features for market appeal; the industrial designer emphasized simplicity, user ability, technical constraints and strict cost targets\u2014hence the conflict.",
    "They covered two related issues: how HEFCW\u2019s intervention powers have worked in practice and what Welsh Ministers and sector bodies are saying about FE/HE closures (in the COVID context).\n\nOn HEFCW powers of intervention\n- HEFCW has statutory intervention and sanction powers under the 2015 Act, but evidence to the committee argued they can be \u201ccumbersome\u201d, overly binary and hard to use for fast, proportionate action (i.e. informal engagement \u2192 very severe sanctions with few intermediate steps).  \n- The Minister disputed the \u201cfrightening\u201d characterization but accepted the committee\u2019s feedback. She and officials want the successor tertiary commission (PCET reform) to include more graduated, flexible \u201csoft\u201d powers (advice, enhanced monitoring, outcome agreements) alongside the stronger legal measures, so regulators can intervene early and supportively as well as escalate if needed.  \n- HEFCW has used informal engagement in practice (helped by Wales\u2019s small sector). Ministers expect HEFCW/the new commission to use the full range of powers where necessary (citing recent issues at Swansea/Trinity St David), but want a commission structured and resourced to maintain close relationships across a larger tertiary footprint.\n\nOn FE/HE closures and conversations about closures\n- FE/HE institutions remain autonomous and have been moving large amounts of teaching online; Welsh Government has been in regular dialogue with universities, colleges and independent providers about continuity, student welfare and contingency arrangements.  \n- Emergency / pandemic legislation would, if needed, give Welsh Ministers temporary powers to close or to direct closures/continuity, redeploy staff and relax regulatory requirements (eg ratios, food provision). Ministers stressed these are exceptional powers and, in normal circumstances, institutions decide operational closures.",
    "They plan to position a universal, fashion-forward remote sold internationally at \u20ac25 with a target unit cost of \u20ac12.50. Marketing will emphasize design and usability: sleek, original/trendy styling (Apple-like white/titanium cues), ergonomic shape, clear internationally recognizable buttons, a one-button mode switch (DVD/TV), and easy learning for broad demographics. Customizable \u201cfronts\u201d/faceplates and color options are a central tactic to increase appeal and create ongoing accessory sales (extra margin). Compatibility (PAL/NTSC, multiple brands, DVD/TV) and possible multifunction features (PDA-like touchscreen options, paging/locator add-on) aim to make it a universal buy and support bundling with the company\u2019s TVs/DVD players.\n\nTheir route to the \u20ac50M profit goal is straightforward financially: with a \u20ac12.50 gross contribution per unit (\u20ac25 price minus \u20ac12.50 cost), they would need to sell about 4 million units to reach \u20ac50M profit. To achieve that volume they\u2019ll: research competitors and standards, design for global usability and manufacturability, keep costs under control through material/production choices, leverage corporate channels and bundling opportunities, and drive differentiation via premium materials and customizable fronts. Short-term steps: competitive research, define essential functions versus added features, refine UI/industrial design, and document decisions\u2014then iterate and scale production/marketing to meet volume targets.",
    "The two meetings covered both the wider Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales strategy and immediate pandemic responses, with consistent themes: whole-system action, local leadership, and protecting vulnerable children.\n\nPolicies and measures\n- Healthy Weight is an all\u2011age, whole\u2011system strategy emphasizing national oversight with local ownership (public services boards, directors of public health). Targets are under consultation (debate over ambition vs deliverability). Resources are uncertain; \u00a38\u201310m pa has been cited against wider existing spend; Welsh consequentials from the UK sugar levy are ~\u00a356m over two years, but hypothecation was resisted.\n- Proposed policy levers include tighter school food regulations (reduce sugar to current SACN levels), banning/limiting energy drinks, restricting price promotions, and exploring planning controls on hot\u2011food takeaways near schools. The clinical obesity pathway will be reviewed; child measurement expansion (longitudinal) is under consideration.\n- Inequalities and early years (first 1,000 days, breastfeeding, Healthy Start) were highlighted as priorities; support for low\u2011income families is needed beyond isolated measures.\n\nPhysical education\n- Concerns about foundation phase staffing compromising physical activity; recommendation to align strategy with the new curriculum, CPD/teacher training and local leadership. Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales are collaborating to scale school/community physical activity. Emphasis on making activity enjoyable and addressing teenage (especially girls\u2019) drop\u2011off. Use of health impact assessments and designing schools as community sport hubs (changing rooms etc.) was supported.\n\nFree\u2011school\u2011meal provision during the pandemic\n- Emergency arrangements were being developed: local authorities and schools to provide continuity of food for eligible pupils during closures, aiming for seamless provision across the immediate closure and Easter period. Schools may operate as hubs for children of key workers and vulnerable pupils; Ministers signalled flexibility in regulations and potential temporary powers to direct provision. Quality of food (school meals vs packed lunches) and safeguarding food access for low\u2011income families remain central concerns.",
    "User Interface pushed for a curved, ergonomic keypad because the shape directly supports usability: a single/biomorphic curve lets the joystick and function buttons rest naturally over the top/underside of the hand, improves grip, and reduces strain. They recommended rubber over the grip (and even a rubber \u201ctail\u201d over the wrist) so the housing could mould to the hand and feel comfortable\u2014practical ergonomics that also allow a distinctive, unconventional silhouette.\n\nThe team agreed on the four headline features for these reasons:\n- Easy to use: the handful-of-controls, joystick/menu approach and ergonomic shaping were intended to simplify operation and support macros (one-button sequences), making the product accessible to a broad audience.\n- Fashion: Real Reactions\u2019 strategy explicitly requires products be \u201cinspired by material fashion\u201d (fruit/veg trends). A curvy, banana-like silhouette and bold colour were chosen to make the remote a fashion object, not just a tool.\n- Easy to find: because the locator feature proved too costly, visibility was prioritized\u2014bright, distinctive colouring (yellow) and a contrasting border to help the remote stand out in clutter.\n- Robust: using rubber/spongy material around a solid plastic core was chosen to give durability and a tactile, protective finish.\n\nUser Interface evaluated \u201cfashion\u201d through the team\u2019s scoring exercise: the group used 1\u20137 ratings, debated the merits (some gave low scores due to limited technical innovation, others high because of the fruit/veg-inspired form and proposed yellow/light effects), and averaged individual scores to reach a consensus that the design met the fashion criterion."
