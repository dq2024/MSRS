    "Based on the meeting transcript, the group needed to make changes to the models used for speech recognition. Specifically, there was a need to improve the models' ability to differentiate between speech and silence, with consideration for the impact of noise conditions.\n\nProfessor B discussed the importance of the English language in relation to the group's work. He emphasized the need to convert certain components of the system into English, particularly in the context of generating instructions for the language generator. He also noted that while the English language translation was a necessary task, it was also a minor one. In other words, English is a tool that is needed but not the main focus of the research.",
    "The group discussed the value and implementation of user and situation models within their belief network system. They aimed to use these models to influence decision-making processes, particularly in determining whether a user would \"go there\" (to a location) or choose a specific \"endpoint\" (destination).\n\nThe user model encompasses various factors such as the user's budget, financial habits (cheap vs. spendy), interests, and current state (e.g., tired, broke). The situation model provides information about the environment, such as whether a location is open, accessible, or has specific features (e.g., selling goods, exhibiting art).\n\nRegarding the user budget, they considered how to represent it within the system, debating whether to use discrete values or a continuous number that updates dynamically as the user \"spends money\". They acknowledged the need for an external mechanism to update the budget and potentially convert the numerical value into relevant ranges for different decisions. The group also recognized the challenge of managing the complexity that arises from combining multiple factors from the user and situation models. They discussed strategies for simplifying the network and avoiding exponential growth in the number of possible combinations.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions about the uncertainty of the Canadian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's actions to address it.\n\nCathy McLeod expressed concern that Canada's economy was already struggling before the pandemic and criticized the government for not providing an economic update to Parliament and Canadians. She questioned the government's priorities, citing the forestry industry's challenges and a perceived lack of support compared to other sectors.\n\nMona Fortier acknowledged the economic uncertainty but emphasized the government's transparency in reporting the measures taken to support Canadians, workers, and businesses. She stated that a comprehensive economic update would be provided as soon as clear economic projections were possible.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the conditions attached to the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF), particularly regarding tax avoidance through tax havens. He expressed skepticism about the government's commitment to preventing tax evasion and avoidance and sought clarification on whether companies using tax havens would be considered to be paying their fair share of taxes in Canada.",
    "The industrial designer considered several characteristics of the tiger worthy of study for the product design. They noted the tiger's well-thought-out hunting strategies, emphasizing that the tiger doesn't act impulsively but plans its actions carefully. The designer also highlighted the tiger's focus on security, particularly its habit of seeking hide spots, implying a need for a design that offers a sense of safety or protection. Additionally, the designer mentioned the tiger's stripes, which could be interpreted as a consideration for visual design elements or patterns for the product. Overall, the designer seemed interested in the tiger's strategic thinking, security-oriented behavior, and distinctive physical features as potential sources of inspiration for the product design.\n",
    "The team discussed the limitations of the current transcriber interface, particularly regarding the encoding of overlaps. They noted that the interface doesn't allow for specifying start and end points of overlaps, leading to incomplete representations.\n\nTo address this, they explored options like expanding the current interface or finding alternative tools. One suggestion was to modify the interface to allow for a \"musical score notation\" style of representation. Dave Gelbart had ideas for this modification. The team also looked into existing interfaces, including one used at Ludwig Maximilians University (deemed too error-prone and unsupported) and another used by Susanne Burger at CMU (capable of eight-channel transcriptions). Praat was also mentioned as a possibility.\n\nUltimately, the team decided to continue using the existing interface with its limitations on overlap detail, prioritizing getting data quickly. However, there was interest in improving the interface if possible, particularly to allow transcribers to specify overlap start and end points. Grad A volunteered to modify Transcriber if a better alternative wasn't found.\n",
    "The presentations covered various aspects of designing a remote control. The industrial designer discussed components design, focusing on materials like hard plastic with soft rubber for the case, and rubber for buttons, considering trends and user comfort. They favored kinetic energy for the battery.\n\nThe user interface expert presented conceptual specifications for user interface components, suggesting basic functions and large skip/volume buttons. An LCD screen was debated for displaying program information but was deemed potentially too costly and not fitting with the desired sturdy design.\n\nThe marketing team shared market findings and trend watching, highlighting ease of use and current trends like fruits, vegetables, and spongy materials. They suggested catchy colors and a dark color option for diversity. The idea of removable covers was introduced, inspired by mobile phone trends. Parental control functionality was also discussed as an optional feature.",
    "The early implementer areas have been valuable in identifying key lessons for the broader rollout of the childcare offer. One significant challenge is the administrative burden placed on local authorities and parents, who must provide extensive documentation to prove eligibility. This process can be particularly difficult for families with complex backgrounds.\n\nThe intensity of demand for services also varies across the early implementer areas due to economic and cultural factors. For example, in some regions, families traditionally rely on grandparents for childcare, leading to lower uptake of the formal offer.\n\nDespite these challenges, the early implementer areas have not experienced significant capacity issues in either English or Welsh language provision, or for children with complex needs. The lessons learned are informing a phased rollout approach, allowing for adjustments based on rurality, urban density, and cost variations. This careful approach aims to ensure a successful full rollout by 2020.\n",
    "The Project Manager expressed reservations about speech recognition, deeming it potentially pointless from an interaction standpoint. They mentioned that the speech recognition technology was a fancy thing that would not have any real use for the remote control. They also stated that it was completely pointless for the interaction point of view and that it was not worth it because it did not add much to the functional design and was not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine. Regarding LCD incorporation, the Project Manager mentioned that they were not decided about the use of an LCD screen on the remote control because of costs. The Project Manager was also concerned about incorporating buttons on the banana remote.",
    "The team discussed standardizing recording conventions to improve data quality for transcription and research. They focused on using consistent, high-quality close-talking microphones to minimize signal variability across speakers. The team considered purchasing additional head-mounted microphones and addressing issues with the existing equipment.\n\nRegarding video recordings, the team acknowledged interest from other research groups but recognized the challenges of infrastructure, human subject concerns, and the lack of internal researchers currently focused on video analysis. While there was interest in incorporating video, no concrete decisions were made due to these obstacles. They also touched on the possibility of using microphone arrays in the future.",
    "The discussion on project finance began with the project manager stating the target selling price for the remote control was 25 euros, which would generate a profit of 50 million euros. The user interface designer questioned if this was a stand-alone unit or specific to a device. The project manager indicated they needed to discuss if it should be a universal remote or specific. The user interface designer thought specifying the price before knowing the product was strange and they needed to find out what people are willing to pay and what they'd expect for 25 euros, because it seems like a lot for a remote. The project manager said this was the job of the marketing person.\n\nRegarding the use of the whiteboard, it was used at the beginning of the first kick-off meeting to get familiar with the tools in the meeting room. Each person was asked to draw their favorite animal on the whiteboard.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer (Nathan) emphasized the importance of using high-quality materials to avoid the cheap feel of many universal remotes. The Project Manager (Marty) focused on balancing functionality with cost, particularly regarding the target selling price of twenty-five Euros. Marty was concerned about the high price point and the need for a universal remote to justify the cost.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the team was aligned on creating a basic television remote. He decided that the simplest options should be pursued, such as infrared technology and batteries for the energy source. He also emphasized the importance of keeping the corporate image in mind when designing the remote.\n",
    "The team's decision-making process for the remote's base involved evaluating several energy source options (batteries, solar, hand dynamo, rechargeable stand). They leaned towards a smaller remote with a locating device, citing current trends favoring smaller electronics. A rechargeable base was initially considered, but the team ultimately decided against it, with concerns that customers would find a base irritating.\n\nFashionability was a key evaluation criterion. Recent trends in Milan and Paris (fruits/vegetables) were considered, but the team worried about short-term trends and preferred a design with longevity. They discussed a \"spongy\" feel, possibly using latex covers that could be changed with trends. The team considered titanium but ultimately decided on plastic with optional latex covers.\n\nThe team discussed the pros and cons of existing remotes. They noted that standard layouts were important for ease of use and that the over-sized remote was too gimmicky.\n",
    "The group discussed several environmental-friendly materials like titanium, hard plastic, soft plastic, and titanium for the back of the remote. They also explored current trends such as fruit and vegetable themes and spongy textures. \n\nPotential materials included wood, latex, titanium, rubber, and colored plastics. An LCD screen was considered but dropped due to budget constraints. Color options ranged from primary colors and bright colors to specific shades like titanium. The group considered a spongy material for the remote's feel, exploring options like latex or a \"stress ball\" type material. \n\nThe material and function issue was addressed by discussing the durability of buttons and the overall strength of the remote's construction. A questionnaire was mentioned as a tool for gathering user feedback on various design elements.\n",
    "The Project Manager, User Interface, and Industrial Designer introduced a remote control prototype with a special surfboard shape, designed to enhance the browsing experience. The group discussed the merits of multi-functional versus single-functional products, ultimately favoring the latter to simplify the design and reduce costs.\n\nThe group gave lower grades in the technological aspect due to the absence of significant innovations beyond the design. While the remote included features such as illuminated buttons and a tactile rubber exterior, it lacked advanced technology like voice recognition, which was deemed too complex and costly.\n\nThe consideration of a locator was presented as a functional requirement to address the common issue of lost remotes. The discussion revolved around implementing a beeping feature triggered by a button on the TV, ensuring the remote's findability without relying on complex technology.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C agreed that, due to time constraints, they would focus less on energy features for overlap detection, as initial experiments were not promising. PhD C will explore pitch-related and harmonicity-related features instead, expressing more hope for these. Alternatively, PhD A suggested expanding Javier's system, which currently identifies speaker changes based on silence. The proposal would involve broadening the classes to potentially include a third category for overlapping speech. PhD C was unsure if the existing system could model the transitions between these different classes. PhD C expressed interest in determining if the clustering process was sufficient to distinguish between overlapping and speaker zones. The discussion with Jose involved the exploration of energy as an indicator of overlap. Normalization methods were discussed, including log energy and LPC residual energy, as well as the appropriate window sizes for normalization. The difficulties and problems faced primarily stemmed from the unreliability of energy as an overlap indicator and the complexity of finding an effective normalization method.",
    "The discussion on latency in the system arose from the use of a smoothing technique in spectral subtraction. This technique involves a recursion that estimates the means of the gain curve, which introduces a delay. Instead of using the current estimated mean to subtract from the current frame, it was found to be more effective to use an estimate from the future, specifically 50 milliseconds into the future.\n\nThe professor had an issue with this latency because it could potentially compound with other latencies in the system, leading to an unacceptable delay in the interactive SmartKom system. He cautioned against completely ignoring latency, as a sudden need to reduce it significantly could create problems down the line. While acknowledging that some latency might be unavoidable, he emphasized the importance of being conservative and mindful of the overall system requirements.\n",
    "The User Interface team introduced several features in their detailed design of the prototype. These include an ergonomic shape, the use of customizable wood for the case, and an LCD screen on a flip panel for easy viewing. The design includes function buttons for power, volume, channel, menu, and voice recognition. There is an additional feature on the back that allows for customized backing, with the possibility of the same on the flip case, depending on the circuit board design.\n\nAdvantages include the ergonomic shape and customizable material, making the remote comfortable to hold and visually appealing. The large on/off button is easy to locate. The voice recognition feature allows for hands-free operation. The LCD screen provides a visual interface for menu navigation and channel selection.\n",
    "The presentation focused on two prototype versions of a remote control, one with an LCD screen and speech recognition and one without. The prototypes are designed to be modular, allowing users to add or remove functionalities like the LCD screen, speech recognition, and parental control modules. The basic model is intended to be simple, with few buttons but powerful functionalities, while add-ons can be included to meet user desires.\n\nThe appearance involves a titanium casing, with a single curved design. The industrial designer mentioned exploring spongy materials for a more modern feel. The design is intended to be robust and includes a mechanism to remind users to return the remote to its charger. The version with the LCD screen features a joystick for navigating the display. A detachable or add-on speech recognition module is also an option.\n",
    "The group discussed several design features for their new remote control, including a touch screen, flip screens, and a flip-top design. A major concern was the budget. The touch screen was initially considered a key marketable feature but was expensive, potentially raising the unit cost significantly. Voice recognition was presented as a cheaper, viable alternative, especially since the technology was already available in-house. They also explored the possibility of using a simpler screen, similar to an iPod, but costs remained a concern.\n\nBattery life and power were also discussed, including the option of solar power with a backup battery. The flip-top design was considered as a way to simplify the interface, with basic functions easily accessible and more complex functions hidden. The group also deliberated over the materials for the case, considering rubber for durability and different case styles to appeal to a broader audience.\n",
    "The Government is drawing several lessons from the three-year Schools Challenge Cymru investment and is applying them to the broader school improvement agenda. Key lessons include the importance of strong and capable school leadership, robust systems for tracking and processes within schools, high-quality teaching, and collaborative activity among schools. Best practices and interventions that drove school improvement are being embedded in the new support provided through regional consortia, with some of the best personnel from Schools Challenge Cymru now employed by these consortia.\n\nThe new school categorization system allows for targeted support, with \"red\" schools entitled to 25 days of support, exceeding the support offered under Schools Challenge Cymru. The program aimed to invest in regional school improvement capacity and enable the transition of schools into the regional consortia. Although some perceived a \"fade out\" during the transition, the government has been determined to learn from the experience and apply those lessons across the board.",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes Brexit has had an impact on Wales' higher education system. He acknowledges an 8% decrease in applications from EU students, contrasting with a 2% increase in England. He attributes this to two main factors: changes in student support arrangements for EU students, and the Anglocentric nature of the media. He suggests that the perception of Wales as less attractive due to relatively lower investment in facilities compared to England could also be a factor.\n\nRegarding why prospective students should choose to study in Wales, Dr. Blaney highlights the message of relative safety. He notes that international students perceive Wales as a comfortable and safe place, partly due to the smaller size of its cities. He emphasizes that Wales offers a UK-quality education and degree within a more supportive environment. He also believes that Brexit has stimulated thinking and that Welsh universities are committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing mobility.\n",
    "The mental space domains include the discourse situation context, entities, and scenarios. The discourse situation context tracks what is going on, while entities contain grammatically specifiable information about a referent. Scenarios hold the basic predication and frames with bindings.\n\nThe middle layer functions as a hidden variable layer to determine the concept of the user, such as if the user is a tourist or running an errand. The features are extracted from the communication and point to the middle layer, which then points to the output mode. For example, features such as the time of day, verb choice, and context point to the middle layer, which then points to the mode of navigation (Tango, Enter, or Vista).",
    "The professor mentions the back-end when discussing tandem features and the Aurora system. He states that the back-end is fairly simple, but attempts to improve it have failed. Chuck tried to improve it, but the professor notes that he was doing it with the same data. The professor also states that there may be something simple that is wrong with the back-end. He wonders if playing with the number of Gaussians would help, but it is unclear if Chuck got to that point. The professor suggests retraining some of the tandem features on a huge amount of data, but also suggests that the recording conditions may be a factor in the poor performance.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on various pressing issues.\n\nOn the seniors care crisis, there was a focus on the disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes, with calls for national standards and the removal of profit from the long-term care system. The Prime Minister emphasized respecting provincial jurisdiction while supporting improvements in care.\n\nRegarding racism, the discussions touched on systemic racism against Indigenous peoples and the need to reimagine institutions. There were calls for a review of the RCMP's use of force and a commitment to prohibiting racial profiling.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were also discussed.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay expressed that anyone is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans, and the government is always open to what it can do in order to provide appropriate compensation.\n\nLastly, the Minister of Seniors highlighted pandemic assistance for seniors, including a one-time tax-free payment to OAS and GIS recipients, while acknowledging the financial burdens seniors face.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer experienced disagreements regarding the remote control's design due to their differing priorities and perspectives. Marketing emphasized consumer preferences and trends, advocating for features like interchangeable faceplates and a fashionable design to enhance marketability. The Industrial Designer focused on the technical aspects, debating between infrared and wireless technology, the practicality of kinetic energy, and material choices like rubber versus plastic. The Project Manager aimed to balance these factors with cost considerations, functionality, and user-friendliness, often questioning the feasibility and necessity of certain features like parental controls and voice recognition. These conflicting viewpoints led to debates over the remote's appearance, functionality, and target audience, resulting in disagreements on various design elements.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, Marketing designed the product evaluation with a shortlist of criteria deemed important for selling the remote control. These criteria included:\n\n1.  **Look and Feel:** This aspect focused on the aesthetic appeal of the remote and its overall design.\n2.  **Innovation:** This criterion assessed the novelty and originality of the remote's features and technology.\n3.  **Ease of Use:** This considered how simple and intuitive the remote was for users to operate.\n4.  **Appealing to the Correct Demographic:** This criterion looked at how well the remote's design and features would resonate with the target audience (20-40 year olds).\n5.  **Following the Company Motto:** This criterion assessed how well the product aligned with the company's core values and mission.\n6.  **Following Fashion Trends:** This criterion assessed how well the product incorporated current design and style trends.\n\nMarketing intended to rate each of the remote designs against these criteria as a group, then average the scores to determine an overall evaluation.\n",
    "The current status of transcription is that approximately 35 hours of recordings have been collected, with about 11 hours transcribed. A goal is to clean and channelize the data, ensuring spell-checking and consistent markup. Regarding intermediate categories in relation to the SPG schema, Barry is creating a proposal with intermediate categories to classify. The intent is to classify these intermediate categories using multi-band techniques, initially using TIMIT and later Switchboard data with the SRI recognizer.",
    "During the meetings, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups as follows:\n\n**Duty to Promote Public Awareness (Group 1):** The Deputy Minister emphasized that her amendments 1 and 4 aimed to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and raise awareness about the change in the law, ensuring the public understood the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment. She argued against amendments that highlighted specific groups or topics, believing they would unnecessarily constrain the awareness campaign and place undue emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others.\n\n**Duty to Report on the Effect of the Legislation (Group 2):** The Deputy Minister highlighted that amendment 2 was influenced by the committee's recommendation for a post-implementation review. She assured that the review would be a continuous program, including attitudinal surveys and data collection. She opposed amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness campaign before section 1 commenced, arguing it would conflict with the priority of setting a commencement date.\n\n**Regulation-Making Powers (Group 3):** The Deputy Minister explained that amendment 3 aimed to add the power to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions. She did not think it was necessary to have wider powers but assured that they would keep this under review coming up to Stage 3 and was happy to discuss this before Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted long-term challenges in raising standards due to changes in performance measures, making trend analysis difficult. The focus has shifted to broader data and statistics for a comprehensive view of educational performance. The Minister acknowledged that the long-term targets of a PISA score of around 500 are part of the National Mission, and that they have to keep the pressure on to strive for those targets.\n\nPhilip Blaker of Qualifications Wales emphasized their role in ensuring fair qualification standards and highlighted the use of comparable outcomes to maintain consistency during specification changes. He also pointed out that the timelines for reforms need to be addressed to allow for sufficient system readiness in the future, and that there should be a paradigm shift in what is expected of resources.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of exams, the Minister stated that the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centers to explain what will need to happen next. They will be trying to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day in August.",
    "The meeting addressed the challenges of implementing good practice across Wales and the implications for childcare services. The Minister acknowledged the complexity of the current childcare system and expressed a commitment to simplifying it. The discussion highlighted the need for consistency in early childhood education and care provision across different parts of Wales, recognizing the variations in local authority approaches.\n\nThe committee explored the idea of a more child-centered approach, where every child could access the childcare offer. The Minister acknowledged the challenges related to the availability and take-up of the childcare offer across different regions, recognizing that demand and historical factors have led to disparities. The potential impact of the national living wage on the affordability of the childcare offer was also discussed, with the Minister stating that the \u00a34.50 rate has been welcomed by the childcare sector. The complexities of balancing quality, affordability, and workforce development within the childcare sector were recognized, emphasizing the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration with providers.\n",
    "The discussion covered various aspects of component availability and design. For the case material, plastic was chosen for the main housing due to its flexibility in creating curved shapes, unlike titanium which is restricted to standard box shapes. A rubber sleeve was proposed as a changeable outer layer to provide a spongy feel and allow for different aesthetic options, drawing inspiration from fruit and vegetable colors.\n\nRegarding the user interface, the team is considering an LCD touchscreen for the top side of the flip-top design, which would allow for a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons. For the bottom side, rubberized buttons made of anti-RSI material are planned. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating voice recognition for locating the remote, pending a cost feasibility check. The standard remote control circuits are available and designers are considering customizing the two circuits for different types of buttons.",
    "The professor believes the final model is promising, particularly with the inclusion of the good VAD, which has significantly improved results. The professor attributes the difference in performance between the Meeting Recorder digits and the TI-digits to the amount of training data, suggesting that a larger dataset would improve the results.\n\nRegarding time series, one student is exploring the use of factorial HMMs to model the transitions of parallel features, drawing inspiration from Mike Jordan's work. Another student is investigating Avendano's work on modulation spectrum for dealing with reverberation, aiming to extend it to handle time-varying reverberation responses.\n\nOn the pronunciation of \"0,\" the professor notes that in digit recognition, both \"O\" and \"zero\" are accepted pronunciations. The professor mentions that the decision to allow people to read the digits as they ordinarily would was a change from the last batch of forms, where it was spelled out which one they should read.\n",
    "The group discussed the introduction of a new remote control project, focusing on several key aspects. Conceptually, the industrial designer suggested a touch-screen with a protective case, exploring kinetic energy as a power source, potentially combined with a rechargeable battery. The design aimed for a dynamic look, favoring a double-curved, rubber casing in vibrant colors, possibly with removable covers for customization.\n\nThe discussion of a universal remote feature involved integrating controls for multiple devices like TVs and VCRs, potentially through a switch or a menu system. Parental control features were considered, with ideas ranging from simple log-in functionality to profile-based restrictions on channels and content, though concerns were raised about the development effort and market demand.\n\nThe inclusion of games was dismissed as adding too much complexity, while voice recognition was seen as a potentially valuable feature, especially for younger demographics, but cost considerations were noted. The final decisions included a combination of battery and kinetic energy, a double-curved rubber case, parental control as an optional feature, and consideration of voice recognition if it did not significantly increase costs.\n",
    "During the meeting, Vaughan Gething addressed concerns about the potential increase in suicide among children and young people due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He mentioned that the government has commissioned a review, conducted by the delivery unit working with the national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths during the pandemic and assess if there's a correlation with the restrictions' impact on mental health and well-being. The report is expected by the end of the month, and the committee will be informed of the results.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Gething acknowledged the challenges faced by new mothers during this uncertain time and the importance of consistent support across Wales. The government is exploring ways to provide support via phone or online and is committed to maintaining progress in this area. However, there have been interruptions in the work to create in-patient capacity, and he could not provide a definite timeframe. He also noted a decrease in women willing to use mother and baby unit provision due to fears related to the pandemic.\n",
    "The work of Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group is currently engaging with officials on agreeing a plan to support the successful implementation of the curriculum. The strategic delivery group was set up about 18 months ago to build collective efficacy, because people out there are seeing a confusion of roles. There is a risk for them to lose focus, but they are very, very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other.\n\nRegarding the risk of losing focus, it was mentioned that the group is very clear about establishing roles and responsibilities and ensuring there isn't duplication of work.\n\nNetworking within the PRU sector has improved a lot. There is an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and they continue to support them during that process. Then, when they're back in school, that support doesn't stop\u2014that support continues, and then there's a managed reduction in that support. Transition arrangements for reintegrating young people into mainstream education get more difficult at key stage 4, and it's working, then, with a team-around-the-family approach to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school, what can the school provide.\n",
    "The group discussed the infra-red functionality, with the industrial designer noting it was the best way to transmit data without needing a sight line. They emphasized the need for a reliable and clear infra-red signal.\n\nRegarding disposable income, the marketing representative stated that the 15-25 age group had a higher disposable income than the 25-35 age group. The group discussed how to target different age groups, particularly regarding voice recognition, with younger people being more likely to pay extra for it. However, some questioned if voice recognition was truly necessary for a remote control, as simplicity and ease of use were also key considerations. Ultimately, they considered simplicity and fashion more important than defining a specific target age group.\n",
    "The group acknowledges that eligibility for free school meals (FSM) may not be the most precise measure but considers it the best available proxy for identifying pupils needing targeted support in the absence of a better alternative. There is ongoing consideration of how Universal Credit might impact future identification of need.\n\nRegarding the impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement, the group recognizes that, while improvements in attendance have been observed, a gap persists between FSM and non-FSM pupils. The PDG is being used to address this through various initiatives, such as proactive outreach to ensure children get to school and employing staff to work directly with families to address barriers to attendance. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can vary, particularly for older children. The group emphasizes the need for a multi-agency approach, involving school nurses, counselors, and external agencies, to address the complex needs of these children and improve their attendance and engagement.\n",
    "Professor C's thoughts on support vector machines (SVMs) were that they are a succinct method for classification, potentially requiring fewer parameters than neural networks or Gaussian mixtures, especially with limited data. He likened SVMs to a \"condensed nearest-neighbor\" approach, selecting critical examples for classification rather than comparing to every single example. He mentioned that Mississippi State researchers had used SVMs for speech recognition, estimating probabilities using a sigmoidal function, with \"OK\" but not groundbreaking results.\n\nRegarding speech rate algorithms, the professor did not directly discuss any speech rate algorithms. However, there was a discussion on mean subtraction to reduce error rate.\n",
    "The professor believes that echoes in the re-synthesized audio could be problematic for training, especially if different phones are aligned with a foreground phone due to the timing of the echo. He suggested that they might be able to get rid of the echoes. The professor also mentioned that they were using the word \"reverberation\" in two ways and that something was being put in because they had averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds, which are then being subtracted from the speech. He thinks it's important to reduce musical noise and the increase of variance during silence portions. He also stated that it's important to have a stable value for the range of the features.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the remote control's user interface. One idea was to incorporate a touchscreen L_C_D_ remote with programmable macros. However, due to the budget, the team considered conventional push-button designs that could offer similar functionality.\n\nThe team also explored the idea of gaming integration, suggesting large buttons for up, down, left, and right, as well as buttons to change camera angles for interactive television. Incorporating a joystick instead of buttons was also suggested.\n\nErgonomics was also an important consideration, with the team aiming for a design that fits comfortably in the hand. The team also discussed the possibility of a biomorphic shape for the remote.\n",
    "During the meetings, the project manager demonstrated a flexible approach to the product's design elements, especially when budget constraints came into play. Initially, the project manager seemed open to a rubber material and double-curved design. However, when the budget became a concern, the project manager suggested switching to plastic for the casing to cut costs, even though rubber was only slightly more expensive. The project manager was willing to compromise on the location of the LCD screen, acknowledging it might not be ideal for both left and right-handed users due to cost-saving measures. While a special color for the unit was desired to make it stand out, it was also put aside due to budget constraints. The project manager seemed open to suggestions and trade-offs to balance desired features with cost limitations.\n",
    "The discussion focused on improving the system and establishing a baseline. They explored various architectural options, including \"combo\" systems with low-pass filtering and different feature combinations (OGI, KLT). The team analyzed performance on matched and mismatched conditions, identifying areas needing improvement, particularly highly mismatched Italian data.\n\nOne idea involved a second silence detection mechanism (\"filt\"), but latency issues on the server side prevented its immediate implementation. They also considered weighting schemes for evaluating the different systems, using a combination of TI-digit and SpeechDat-Cars data. The team discussed the impact of low-pass filter cepstrum and the potential benefits of dimension reduction. They agreed to focus on a few promising architectures and compare them using a weighted measure. The sizes of the test sets were also discussed to better understand the significance of the observed differences in performance.",
    "The meeting transcripts discuss various issues, including legislation, sports infrastructural construction, government support for energy resources and tourism, funding in the green economy and small businesses, and the impact of Covid-19 on fishing, tourism, oil, and gas.\n\nThe government is providing liquidity measures for large-cap corporations in the oil and gas sector, and there are liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry. The government is also working with the provinces and territories to support them through generous transfers of money to boost their healthcare systems.\n\nThe government is also providing support for the forestry industry, including traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies, and grows. The government is also working with small businesses to provide assistance, including reducing their rent and protecting landlords with up to 75% of the rent.\n\nThe government is also working to ensure businesses can access the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe when they reopen. The government is also working with individual eligible CERB recipients to make sure they are not put in positions of undue hardship.\n",
    "The team explored several aspects of the remote control's design and functionality. Initially, there was a consensus that the remote should have fewer buttons and a more interesting shape than standard remotes. The team considered novel shapes, with a single-curved, ergonomic design gaining traction for its ease of use.\n\nThe idea of personalization was introduced, with the possibility of interchangeable casings in different fruit shapes. While the team liked the idea of a novel shape, there was concern about the feasibility and marketability of a fruit-shaped remote. The team also debated the number of functions the remote should have, with some arguing for simplicity and others suggesting more advanced features like voice recognition.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a rubber casing with a double-curved shape for ergonomic comfort. The final design incorporated colorful rubber, push buttons, and the possibility of different covers, drawing inspiration from fruits and vegetables without fully committing to a literal fruit shape.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed colors like lemon or lime for the product due to an emerging top European fashion trend featuring fruits and vegetables, particularly in clothing and furniture. They aimed to observe this trend and incorporate it into the product's design to align with current market preferences. The marketing team believed that this approach would contribute to a \"fancy look and feel,\" which market research indicated was the number one priority for consumers regarding remote controls. They also wanted to capitalize on trends for soft, spongy materials and vibrant, natural colors to create a more comfortable and friendly product, differentiating it from competitors still using last year's styles. The team aimed to create a cohesive marketing identity by using a theme like lemon or lime, associating it with textures, shapes, and colors that consumers already recognize and find appealing.\n",
    "The overall conclusion regarding the remote control style, market research, adjustments, and minimization of repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the simulation market evaluation is that the team has a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria derived from market research. The design incorporates a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, and current fashion trends.\n\nMarket research indicated a preference for user-friendly designs and a willingness to spend more for aesthetically pleasing remote controls. Adjustments were made, such as removing teletext functionality and focusing solely on TV and video functions to simplify the design and reduce costs.\n\nThe team acknowledged the challenge of minimizing RSI due to the zapping behavior observed in users. While they explored options like touch screens, they recognized the limitations of current technology and capabilities. The selected button material and a smaller size aimed to mitigate RSI. The evaluation findings suggest that the design meets the specifications adequately, with the lowest rating being for RSI minimization. The team is happy to proceed with the prototype and marketing, believing that further modifications would not significantly improve RSI reduction with current technology.\n",
    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) representatives assessed Brexit's impact on Welsh higher education, emphasizing their apolitical stance. Universities contribute significantly to Wales' economy, and Brexit introduces uncertainty regarding relationships with Europe. Initial data suggests an 8% decrease in EU applicants to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 2% increase in England. Anecdotal evidence hints at increasing difficulties in EU collaborative research activities for UK institutions. HEFCW acknowledges potential financial turbulence and its effects on institutions.\n\nDiscussions on women's issues did not occur in this meeting transcript.\n\nHEFCW identified the funding position as the main pressure, particularly the delay in re-establishing funding per the Diamond report recommendations, which predate Brexit. Other pressures include declining Welsh and English applications, rising pay and pension costs, increased student expectations, and uncertainty from England's review of fees and funding. Universities anticipate \u00a338 million income from European students and \u00a391 million from European program funding, totaling 8% of sector income. HEFCW monitors sustainability through financial forecasts and acknowledges banks' increasing risk aversion in lending to institutions.\n\nMembers discussed the factors behind the decline in EU students applying to Welsh institutions, including changes in student support arrangements and the Anglocentric nature of media. They also mentioned lower fee levels denoting quality in the student mind. They explored the need to differentiate Wales from the UK to attract international students. HEFCW officials stated that they work with the Welsh government to decide the best course of action.\n",
    "The discussion on the \"digits\" recordings centered around several key aspects. Initially, the group discussed the progress of data collection for the digits corpus, noting they were nearing completion. A primary goal was to train a recognizer using this data and begin working with it.\n\nThe conversation then shifted to the process of transcribing the digits, with concerns raised about false starts and misreads. There was a discussion about whether transcribers should use a specific script to extract the digits or if a smaller group should handle it. The group decided to have the transcribers perform this task, as it aligns with their current skill set and contributes to a more complete transcript. They also considered having transcribers input additional information like name, time, and date, but there were reservations about the time it would take away from their primary transcription duties.\n\nThe group also talked about potential issues with articulation and feature modeling due to the limited nature of digit reading compared to conversational speech. Finally, performance benchmarks were also discussed.\n",
    "The marketing representative suggests speech recognition because surveys indicate that 75-90% of the 15-35 age demographic are willing to pay for it, viewing it as a trendy feature. The industrial designer believes speech recognition is feasible if users undergo a training process, potentially reducing overall costs. The user interface designer acknowledges the appeal but raises concerns about ambient noise and potential interference from television audio, suggesting the speech recognizer must be sophisticated enough to filter out TV speech. The user interface designer thinks that if designed to meet the requirements, it would be a good marketing gimmick.\n",
    "The discussion involved several topics. Regarding consortia, Jassa Scott noted they've improved their knowledge of schools' strengths and weaknesses since 2017, using this to support and challenge schools, especially those causing concern. However, they haven't focused enough on improving teaching and learning in struggling schools, and their support for secondary schools is less impactful than for primary schools, due to difficulties recruiting specialists. Estyn doesn't have specific inspection powers over consortia. ERW was a concern due to leadership instability and budget issues. Meilyr Rowlands felt local authorities were too small to deliver school improvement services alone.\nBill Blair said that firearms violence in communities is unacceptable and the government is working to strengthen gun control to keep Canadians safe.\nThe political background involves the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response, including economic measures and debates over parliamentary procedures. The aim of the group is to examine and address issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere were no comments about the Auditor General or measures proposed for ensuring social stability.",
    "The team discussed several functions for the remote control. A key realization was the need for a \"lost-and-found\" function. The team brainstormed ideas such as a beeping sound, a blinking light, or a signal emitted when the remote is hidden or in a dark place. A light sensor was suggested to trigger the signal when the remote is covered.\n\nDuring project evaluation, improvements such as larger, simpler, and more user-friendly buttons were discussed. Speech recognition was considered as a potential high-class feature that consumers might be willing to pay more for. The team also explored the idea of a charging base with a \"find\" button that would make the remote beep.\n\nNew functions brainstormed included multi-functionality, such as controlling temperature or other household machines, and incorporating a universal remote function to work with various devices. The team also discussed the possibility of a menu button for audio, video, and language settings, and voice recognition for channel selection.",
    "During the finance discussion, the group did not discuss the button colors. However, during the prototype presentation, the Industrial Designer mentioned that they were considering \"fruity colors\" for the buttons. Marketing did not express explicit dissatisfaction with specific button color changes. However, Marketing expressed general concerns that the designs were becoming less \"fashionable\" and \"cool looking.\" Additionally, Marketing was concerned about potentially alienating older users with features like the scroll wheel.\n",
    "Key points regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension included the need for resources to support the Welsh dimension and that resources should be broad and not confined to specific areas. There was also discussion about the need to ensure that the Welsh dimension is integrated across the curriculum.\n\nRegarding employers' understanding of the Welsh Bac, the witnesses agreed that employers generally lack a clear understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification and its components. It was stated that employers are more focused on specific qualifications and skills relevant to their industries. Some felt the title \"Welsh Bac\" is unhelpful and that the \"skills challenge certificate\" is better understood. There was a feeling that employers need to be more engaged in the design and delivery of the Welsh Bac.\n\nRegarding the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales, it was stated that Estyn has developed the use of nominee and peer inspectors.",
    "The team had mixed feelings about the convenience of the presentation materials. The industrial designer expressed a general dislike for Microsoft PowerPoint. The user interface designer echoed this sentiment, finding the PowerPoint presentations unhelpful and irrelevant to their work. They felt the information available to them was lacking, leading them to create their own content. On the other hand, the marketing representative found their materials helpful. The project manager felt disconnected from the design process due to limited access to the same resources as the designers. The industrial designer liked that they could write on the whiteboard. Overall, there was a sense that the materials were not ideal, with some team members finding them unhelpful or preferring alternative methods.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to concerns about cost and functionality. While an LCD screen could potentially display channel listings or other information, the team recognized the complexity and expense of integrating such a feature. They questioned the value of having the remote control \"talk back\" to the user and determined that the cost of an LCD screen would not be the best use of resources. The team also noted that an LCD screen would require a more advanced logic chip, further increasing costs. The team focused on the look and feel and decided to pursue a simpler, more cost-effective design.\n",
    "The team members introduced themselves and their roles, which included project manager, user interface, industrial designer, and marketing. The project was introduced as designing and creating a new, trendy, and user-friendly remote control for television, aiming for a selling price of twenty-five Euros and a production cost of twelve and a half Euros.\n\nThe brainstorming process involved discussing current frustrations with remote controls, such as difficulty using them in the dark, losing them, and the abundance of confusing buttons. Ideas for improvement included incorporating a tracking device, hidden panels for advanced functions, and a more interesting shape.\n\nThe project evaluation involved assessing the design's features, functionality, cost, and brand recognition. The team used a scale to rate the design's success in meeting its original aims.\n\nThe project process included individual work on the design, technical functions, and marketing requirements, followed by team meetings to discuss and evaluate ideas. The team also considered the international market, the wealth of different countries, and the need for a unique selling point.",
    "During the discussion about extra features for the remote control, the team considered adding rechargeable units. The project manager suggested that if the remote was priced at twenty-five Euros, there should be enough budget for rechargeable units. The industrial designer questioned the practicality, noting that remote control batteries can already last for two to three years. They also pointed out that a base unit would need its own battery or connection to a power outlet. The project manager thought making it rechargeable wouldn't add much to the cost and would solve battery problems, ensuring the remote is always findable and ready. An alternative idea was presented to skip the recharger but include a trendy bay with a \"bleep\" function to locate the remote.\n",
    "The group decided to purchase a half dozen head-mounted microphones of the same model to standardize microphone usage. This decision was made because the current lapel microphones are not all of the same type, and the way they are worn varies, leading to inconsistencies in audio quality. Standardizing the microphones will reduce the variability that researchers working on dialogue and prosody have to account for. The microphones would be used to record signals separately and time-align them with the start of the meeting. The group will field test one microphone before committing to the purchase.\n",
    "During the meetings, Kirsty Williams AM addressed several challenges faced by secondary schools. She emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of students and staff, highlighting the need for clear communication with parents and staff about the evidence and information used to make decisions regarding school reopening.\n\nMeilyr Rowlands noted that secondary schools face a greater challenge than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum, partly due to funding disparities. He expressed concern about the difficulty in recruiting teachers, particularly at the secondary level, and the potential impact on the ability of schools to implement the curriculum effectively. Rowlands also noted that pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school.\n\nBoth Rowlands and Williams discussed the need for support for students with emotional and mental health difficulties, including increased funding for local authorities to ramp up services. Williams mentioned the importance of flexibility in delivering counselling and therapy, including remote options like telephone and video support. Williams stated that there will be no change to student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home.\n\nRegarding studying from home, Williams emphasized the importance of providing clear advice and guidance to parents on the Hwb platform. She acknowledged the challenges of home schooling and encouraged parents not to be too hard on themselves. Both Williams and Rowlands emphasized the need to address digital disadvantage and ensure that all children have access to the hardware and connectivity they need to participate in digital learning.\n",
    "During the detailed design discussion, the Industrial Designer (Sebastian) focused on several key aspects of the new spherical remote control. He emphasized the importance of interoperability, suggesting the remote should control multiple devices and use modern communication methods like Bluetooth, rather than relying solely on infrared.\n\nHe also considered the user experience, questioning whether buttons were the only control option and mentioning the possibility of using a joystick-like stick for easier channel and track switching. Sebastian acknowledged the vulnerability of such a control but seemed to like the versatility. Stability was another concern, as a spherical remote could roll, necessitating a flat side. He also questioned the practicality of a flip-open design, suggesting it might be left open all the time and could be a point of failure. Overall, the Industrial Designer aimed for a balance between trendy design, technical feasibility, and user-friendly functionality.\n",
    "The group believes that Erasmus and mobility funding for students is important and that the Welsh sector is committed to finding ways of promoting and resourcing mobility. They note that there have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to continue being able to access the Erasmus programme, and that would be far better than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only program. They also note that seven of the eight universities are already using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this, which is positive.\n\nOn the question of whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees, the transcript indicates that there are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to ensure that the material meets their needs. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students' union and through course committees to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have.\n",
    "The meetings covered several topics:\n*   **Local Authoritative Frameworks:** Local communities mobilized to support vulnerable populations by forming task forces, food service responses, and businesses retooling to produce essential items like hand sanitizer.\n*   **Condolences:** Members expressed sadness over the deaths of community figures, including a mayor and a newspaper editor.\n*   **Employment:** Discussions included extending the old age security benefit and guaranteed income supplement, the challenges of Canada Post delivering goods, the difficulties of businesses accessing support programs like CEBA and CEWS, the importance of the Canada summer jobs program for young people and indigenous communities, and supporting small businesses and the energy sector.\n*   **Workers' Safety:** Discussions included the safety of migrant workers, the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, and the challenges faced by staff in long-term care facilities.\n*   **Pay Dispute Situations:** There was discussion about a pay dispute in the FE sector and a potential pensions issue.",
    "The thanks from Whitehorse to the House of Commons and the Canadian Armed Forces were expressed by a member of parliament for Yukon. They thanked the Canadian Armed Forces for their invaluable assistance in long-term care facilities. They noted that the observations and testimonies of the CAF members revealed the extent of the nightmare that many seniors had endured, including starvation, abuse, and neglect. The member expressed that it is up to everyone to ensure that no elderly person is ever hurt in this manner again.\n",
    "The group discussed the functions, characters, and design requirements of a remote control, emphasizing simplicity and user-friendliness. The prioritized functional requirement was a television-only remote, excluding DVD or internet capabilities. The marketing expert's usability tests showed that users primarily use channel, volume, and power functions.\n\nThe industrial designer emphasized plastic as the case material to avoid interference and potential lawsuits. As a possible feature, the user interface expert suggested a touchscreen with submenus for extra functions, keeping primary functions easily accessible. The group explored a touchpad with basic controls like channel and volume. Voice recognition for basic controls was considered, along with a paging system to locate the remote.\n\nThe group also discussed the possibility of a scroll feature. Ultimately, the group decided that a scroll feature would not be included. Instead, they opted for a simpler design with a touchscreen and submenus for extra functions.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion revolved around designing a new television remote control with a focus on user needs and desires. Marketing presented findings from a usability lab, highlighting that users find remotes ugly and are willing to pay more for a fancier design. Younger users desired voice recognition, while older users did not. Marketing also brought up Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) as a concern.\n\nFor the upcoming team meeting, the plan is to delve into a detailed design meeting where they will review the prototype. The team will discuss the technical aspects of the remote's functions, conceptual designs, and how to make the remote original, trendy, and user-friendly. They'll also discuss and evaluate the project process. The team will also discuss how to gather content for the remote.\n",
    "The lab tests indicated that users are generally unhappy with current remote controls, finding that they don't match operating behavior. Users only utilize about 10% of the buttons available on current models.\n\nThe group discussed the inclusion of a \"finder\" button that would cause the remote to emit a beeping noise, aiding in its location. The call button would be on the television. The discussions included that the user group was teenagers and young professionals.\n\nThe team considered a minimalist approach, potentially incorporating a circular touchpad similar to an iPod for channel and volume control. The design should be fashionable, incorporating silver and yellow. The team discussed the possibility of a function switch button to toggle between TV, DVD, and VCR modes.\n\nThe team agreed that the lighting adaptive options were not needed.\n",
    "The team discussed using a new scenario to better capture subject intention, involving abstract tasks and a tourist map of Heidelberg. The goal is to prompt more natural interactions without subjects directly repeating task phrasings. The team also wants to use a wizard to help capture subject intention.\n\nDAT recorders and Santa Barbara Corpus were discussed for far-field ASR models. Also, infrastructure tools are needed to be set up to better distribute the data and transcripts.\n\nThe team is creating an XML schema to be sent from one module to another, defining action schema, Source-Path-Goal schema, and forced motion. The team wants the module to be able to tell the system that the person wants to go somewhere and buy something to eat.\n",
    "The group discussed the case design, considering options like flat, single-curved, and double-curved casings. The single-curved design was favored for its potential to angle the screen for better viewing. A significant decision was made regarding changeable cases, with the group agreeing to design one standard remote control with the option to sell different case covers separately. This allows for personalization and marketing opportunities (\"Give your grandfather a new case\").\n\nInitially, there was a consideration of two product lines, one with wood-like color/feel and another in grey-black. However, the discussion shifted toward a single remote design with changeable cases to accommodate different aesthetic preferences.\n",
    "Huw David welcomes full involvement in the Bill's implementation and stresses the need for a major awareness-raising campaign to bring families, carers, and parents along. He emphasizes the importance of supporting parents who struggle with parenting through a universal offer across Wales. David believes the state's paramount role is to protect children from harm, aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which considers physical punishment as harmful.\n\nHe views the Bill as a reflection of a cultural shift in Wales, where most parents no longer support physical punishment. He hopes that careful implementation with the right resources will prevent unintended consequences. However, he stresses the importance of resources being made available due to overstretched social services departments, which are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect.\n\nWhen asked directly if there should be a duty on the face of the Bill for awareness raising to happen, David initially hesitates, acknowledging the Welsh Government's commitment, before stating that there should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers, as the WLGA position.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the design and functionality of the two-sided remote control, focusing on several key aspects.\n\n**Design & Functionality:** The user interface team presented two prototypes: one shaped like a banana and another with a more abstract, organic design. They considered both hard plastic and spongy rubber materials, with a preference for bright yellow with black buttons to align with company colors. The team emphasized a simple design with minimal buttons and an intuitive menu system.\n\n**Evaluation & Market Range:** The marketing team planned a user-centric evaluation based on criteria like \"fancy,\" \"technologically innovative,\" \"easy to use,\" and \"sellable.\" The initial market trend leaned toward a design that was elegant and easy to use, rather than overly technological. The team also touched on the potential for fashionable covers as a separate product.\n\n**Technical Requirements:** While waterproof and shockproof capabilities were mentioned, they weren't thoroughly explored. The project manager raised concerns about the durability of the banana-shaped design, suggesting hard plastic for reinforcement. The industrial designer noted the use of simple, robust components to control costs. The group also briefly considered kinetic energy as a power source.\n",
    "Group 3 of the amendments focused on the regulation-making powers in the Bill. The Deputy Minister introduced amendments to provide certainty on the commencement date of the core provision, abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment. These amendments also included the power to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions related to the commencement of Section 1.\n\nSuzy Davies introduced amendment 3A as a \"probing amendment.\" She questioned whether the \"transitory, transitional and saving provisions\" were sufficient powers for the Welsh Government to implement Section 1, suggesting the need for a more unrestricted power to make regulations. Davies expressed concern that without broader regulatory powers, the Assembly's influence over the implementation of Section 1 and related policy areas would be limited. She indicated a willingness to discuss this further before Stage 3. The Deputy Minister responded that she did not think wider powers were necessary but would keep it under review, agreeing to discuss it further before Stage 3.\n",
    "Brexit impacts Welsh higher education institutions through decreased EU student applications and difficulties in EU collaborative research activities. Executives are addressing these challenges by strengthening the Global Wales engagement to promote Wales as a study destination, and by working with UK universities to advocate for continued access to Horizon 2020's successor. Institutions are also developing contingency plans and incorporating Brexit considerations into their fee and access plans to protect student mobility.\n\nRegarding the local production of PPE, Novo Textiles in Surrey Centre has retooled its factory to produce surgical masks and N95 masks. The government states that it has contracts with domestic producers, including General Motors, and has received millions of surgical masks.\n\nRegarding projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada, there is no explicit update on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada. The Minister of Infrastructure and Communities states that many projects have been approved in recent weeks.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not discuss the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada. However, the meetings do refer to some points regarding government support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some key points are:\n\n*   The government's priority was to get help to as many people as quickly as possible during the pandemic, even if it meant cleaning up fraudulent cases later.\n*   The government provided income replacement through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to millions of Canadians.\n*   The government increased the amount of the Canada Child Benefit to support families, single parents, and families with young children.\n*   The government sent significant resources to shelters across the country to house homeless people and prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n*   The government provided financial support to charities and non-profits to help vulnerable Canadians.\n*   The government is committed to supporting seniors and has announced a one-time, tax-free payment for eligible seniors and additional funding for programs that help seniors.\n*   The government is working with the provinces and territories to provide support for long-term care facilities and to develop stronger standards for seniors' care.",
    "The marketing expert emphasizes the importance of a marketable product with features like the base station and remote locator. They suggest focusing on silver and black designs to match televisions. The expert believes the product has the features, characteristics, and background to be marketable at a competitive cost of 35 to 50 Euros, potentially targeting an exclusive market. They propose a lifetime guarantee and suggest exploring upgradability.\n\nRegarding user identification, the marketing expert suggests the remote control should be aware of who is using it, and since speaker-dependent speech recognition is desired, that could be the means of identifying the user. They also suggest that it could record channel and volume preferences and provide ways of using them.\n\nThe expert believes the remote control has to be fancy with a fancy look and feel. Strangely enough, the expert believes it is more important to be fancy and technologically innovative than easy to use. The expert also states that the trends in big cities like Paris and Milan indicate that things should have a fruit and vegetable way of looking or feeling.\n",
    "The main points discussed regarding the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 centered around its universal adoption, advantages, and weaknesses, with a focus on potential amendments in the forthcoming PCETR Bill.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   The Act's strategic aims, including regulation of institutions, safeguarding public contributions, fair access, and institutional autonomy, remain relevant.\n*   It provided HEFCW with new powers of intervention and sanctions.\n*   The Act ensures a level of regulation proportional to public funds received by institutions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n*   There are differing views on whether the Act has fulfilled all strategic aims.\n*   HEFCW's powers were perceived as inflexible and difficult to use for swift interventions.\n*   The Act focused on individual institutions, discouraging collaboration.\n*   The Act did not directly address issues around governance in the sector.\n*   The legislation may not have been strong enough, requiring objectives to be driven through annual remit letters.\n*   The Act's framing around institutional autonomy may hinder institutions from fulfilling national outcomes.\n*   The charitable status requirement prevented the regulation of alternative private providers.\n*   Fee and access plans were seen as focused on inputs rather than outcomes, and the annual timescale was considered inappropriate.",
    "The group presented and discussed the evaluation criteria for the remote control prototype. The criteria included assessing how fancy, functional, cool, and trendy the remote control was, as well as determining if users would actually buy it and replace their existing remote. The group used a scale of 0-7 to evaluate each criteria.\n\nDuring the discussion, the group debated the remote's design and functionality, especially the use of scroll wheels and the teletext button. They also considered the remote's target audience and whether the banana design would appeal to them. The group evaluated the cost of components, aiming to stay within the target price of twelve point five Euro. They explored ways to reduce costs, such as using a regular chip instead of an advanced one and making the case from plastic. The group also discussed the need for market research and focus groups to gather feedback from the target audience and identify potential new features for future versions of the remote.\n",
    "The participants discussed several aspects of the computer navigation system and data collection.\n*   **CD's for backup:** They mention using tapes for archiving, and CDs as an option but state they are unreliable for long-term storage due to degradation.\n*   **Probability Computation:** The group discussed different ways to combine the influences of different factors on a decision, including weighted averages and a \"mixture of experts\" approach using a hidden variable to decide which expert to trust in a given situation.\n*   **Experimental Setup:** The experiment involves a user interacting with a system (initially a simulated computer, then a human operator) to solve tasks in a virtual environment (Heidelberg). The system tracks the user's location, and the user is told the system knows their location via GPS. The goal is to gather data on how people phrase requests and express intentions in a tourist domain.",
    "The group decided against positioning symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote due to concerns about usability. While it was acknowledged that this design could offer more options, particularly for left-handed users, the team felt it might complicate the ease of use, especially for the target demographic of elderly individuals.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating both right- and left-handed versions of the remote. This idea was met with mixed reactions. While the User Interface team member was open to the possibility, citing the ability to build rocket ships, the Marketing team member questioned the practicality of families needing two separate remotes. There was a discussion about whether left-handed users could adapt to a right-handed design, with some arguing that the basic functions wouldn't pose a significant challenge. Ultimately, the team seemed to lean towards a single, ambidextrous design to avoid added complexity and cost.\n",
    "The team discussed cost reduction strategies to meet the 12.50 Euro production cost target. To achieve this, they considered abandoning certain features. The project manager initially proposed eliminating solar cells and the voice recognition feature. Other ideas included switching from rubber to plastic buttons and considering a less enhanced casing due to the limited functionality after removing features.\n\nThe team also discussed the possibility of offering customizable covers to maintain a trendy appeal while using a basic, less expensive design for the main product. They weighed the pros and cons of keeping the rubber casing, which was favored for its \"squishy\" feel and durability, against other features like the curved design and special colors. Ultimately, they decided to scrap the speech recognition and special colors to stay within budget, focusing on a basic remote with customizable cover options.\n",
    "The discussion around voice recognition presented both potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n*   **Intuitive Control:** Market research indicated that a significant portion of customers would be willing to spend more for more intuitive control, such as voice recognition.\n*   **Target Market Appeal:** Voice recognition was seen as particularly appealing to the target demographic of young professionals (15-35), who are generally more tech-savvy and have more disposable income.\n*   **Accessibility:** It was noted that incorporating speech recognition could also make the remote more accessible to people with physical disabilities.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*   **Technology Limitations:** One participant expressed concern about the current state of voice recognition technology, citing experiences with systems that were unreliable and frustrating to use.\n*   **Cost:** There was an assumption that implementing voice recognition would likely increase the cost of the remote.\n*   **Complexity vs. Simplicity:** There were concerns that adding voice recognition might detract from the goal of creating a simple and easy-to-use device.\n*   **Functionality Focus:** It was argued that the focus should be on the functions the remote needs to fulfill, rather than getting locked into a specific technology like voice recognition.\n*   **Power Constraints:** The inclusion of voice recognition might add to the power requirements of the device.",
    "The discussion on battery options covered several alternatives. The Industrial Designer (ID) initially questioned the use of bulky AAA batteries, suggesting smaller lithium batteries could reduce the remote's size. The ID presented options like standard AA/AAA batteries, dynamo charging (wind-up), solar charging, and kinetic charging (like in wristwatches). The ID noted the lack of a rechargeable option, and the potential for a dual power system with standard batteries and solar charging. The ID also expressed concerns about the durability of solar cells and the aesthetic impact of integrating them into the design.\n\nThe ID preferred the kinetic charging option for originality and convenience, even though there was no market research to back it up, but was worried about the draw on the battery. The team ultimately decided on kinetic charging with watch-type batteries.\n\nThe ID did not recommend a charger for the industrial working design. The ID suggested kinetic charging, and stated the amount of power needed was small enough that the kinetic energy would be enough to power the remote.\n",
    "The project was considered for inclusion in a conference paper for several reasons:\n\n*   **Documenting Progress:** It was seen as a good idea to document the work done so far, specifically the Bayes-net stuff.\n*   **Exploring a Complex Issue:** The team wanted to highlight the complexity of seemingly simple statements like \"where is X\" and how they can be ambiguous in discourse.\n*   **Introducing New Formalism:** The paper could serve as a platform to introduce the new formalism the team was developing, even if not in complete detail.\n*   **Cognitive and Neural Motivation:** The conference's interdisciplinary nature (cognitive, neural, psycho-linguistic, and computer science) aligned with the project's goals.\n*   **Potential for Interesting Questions:** The team hoped that designing a belief-net would lead to interesting questions and answers.\n*   **Addressing Ambiguity:** The paper could challenge the notion that certain linguistic phenomena are ambiguous in discourse, suggesting that even seemingly unambiguous statements are complex.\n*   **Opportunity for Collaboration:** Writing the paper would involve input from various team members, including Nancy and Jerry.\n*   **Testing a \"Delusion of Adequacy\":** The team considered taking a \"where is X\" sentence and pretending to parse and understand it from a cognitive, neural, psycho-linguistic, and construction grammar perspective.\n*   **No Harm in Trying:** It was mentioned that even if the paper got rejected, it wouldn't hurt because it was based on work already done.\n*   **General Interest:** While some aspects of the SmartKom system might not be of general interest, the project had the potential to be more broadly appealing.",
    "Kirsty Williams did not express specific thoughts on the funding allocated to the consortia, beyond expecting money to be spent on professional learning. She did, however, say that she was in favour of a strong and sustainable HE sector and that mergers were a matter for individual institutions. Williams expressed interest in university governance as well, stating that she had sought to have a more direct relationship with the chairs of universities. She mentioned an independent review of governance, chaired by Gillian Camm, and expressed a desire to introduce a regulatory condition regarding good governance in the PCET Bill. Finally, the transcript did not address admission problems in Welsh universities.",
    "The team discussed several energy sources for the remote, including solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power. They decided to go with batteries over a charging base because a smaller remote was preferred. Lithium batteries were selected over triple A batteries because they were seen as more technologically advanced and suited to the target demographic.\n\nThe technological innovations included a voice-activated locator for finding the remote when lost and kinetic energy to power the remote. The team also discussed voice recognition for channel changing but decided against it due to potential usability issues. The final prototype included a thumb-shaped power button, index finger channel up, middle finger channel down, ring finger volume up, pinkie volume down, and a lock button.\n\nOverall, the team felt they had created a fashionable and ergonomic remote that met the criteria. They praised the teamwork and the use of new technologies. The final prototype was within budget and incorporated the desired features. The team was enthusiastic about the marketability of the remote, emphasizing its unique design and potential for preventing repetitive strain injury.\n",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the remote control project. They considered different energy sources, including basic batteries, hand dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar cells, ultimately leaning towards kinetic energy generation through a squeezable rubber design.\n\nThey also considered a sample sensor for voice recognition. However, they determined the cost would be too high. The group decided against including teletext support.\n\nThe project announcement email was not specifically discussed in the transcripts.\n",
    "The key points discussed in the last meeting revolved around reviewing the prototype remote and evaluating its features against pre-established criteria. The team examined the physical design, including the button layout, slide-out panel for advanced functions, and interchangeable faces. They also assessed the voice recognition technology and its integration with the remote.\n\nA significant problem arose concerning the project's budget. The inclusion of solar cells and a backup battery pushed the costs over the target of twelve fifty Euro. The team explored potential solutions, such as removing the solar cells or the backup battery, but recognized that these changes would impact the remote's environmental theme and marketing strategy. Ultimately, the team decided to proceed without the solar cells to meet the budget.",
    "Hefin David AM raised several concerns regarding the \u00a34.50 single national rate for childcare, questioning its potential impact on creating a two-tiered system where wealthier parents can afford better care through add-ons. He inquired whether the rate was equally welcomed in more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport and whether it might create capacity problems. He also highlighted the potential burden on lowest-income working families who may struggle to afford additional costs like transport and snacks.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies acknowledged the concerns, stating that Cardiff and Newport are eager to implement the offer. He admitted that the \u00a34.50 rate may need to be adjusted based on the pilot results in these areas. He defended the additional charges by stating parents are used to them and the government has to work within a realistic budget.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line normalization involved PhD C exploring different means for silence and speech, controlled by voice activity detection probability. He noted strange behavior with C-one coefficients, where silence and speech had different means depending on the noise. He also experimented with a variable time constant for faster adaptation. Professor B suggested analyzing error types to understand if normalization improved some aspects while worsening others.\n\nRegarding phase normalization, PhD F mentioned trying long-term mean subtraction with garbage results. Grad G discussed using complex arithmetic instead of polar representation, and experimenting with unwrapping the phase, which worsened results. He also explored dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of subtracting the log. He noted potential issues with scaling complex numbers due to the Taylor expansion. Grad A was more focused on quals preparation. Professor B didn't give an opinion.\n",
    "The meeting discussed several aspects of detecting important linguistic features. One topic was the downsampling problem related to feature vector streams. It was noted that there is no low-pass filtering before the downsampling, and Hynek suggested TRAPS. Another topic was feature selection, and finding what variables are useful.\n\nThe advantage of using Noisy-ORs was discussed as a way to combine different kinds of front-end representations for robustness. Noisy-ORs can help determine how strongly to train different pieces based on a reasonable criterion with hidden variables, rather than assuming equal strength towards every detector. Also, the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on a reasonable criterion with hidden variables.\n\nThe transcription formalization was discussed in terms of spelling checks, exhaustive listing of forms, handling pronunciation variants, acronyms, and different types of comments. The importance of systematic encoding was emphasized for scripting purposes. Also, it was important to know that what is in the dictionary is consistent and up to date.\n",
    "The team discussed system involvement in demos, including using the Transcriber interface with prosodic information and integrating THISL IR for information retrieval. It was also mentioned that Transcriber was successfully installed on a Windows machine. There was a discussion on the status of transcriptions, with IBM handling some and Jane hiring new transcribers for others. A web page was being maintained to track transcription progress.\n\nRegarding backups, the team discussed storing meeting data on non-backed-up disks to save overhead, but Dave Johnson advised against it, recommending manual archiving and backups. Collecting notes during meetings was explored, including using CrossPads and PDAs for time-stamped annotations. However, the team acknowledged infrastructure and usability challenges with CrossPads. Professor B suggested scheduling meetings to summarize the data. Professor B. thought it would be best to return one of the CrossPads.",
    "The committee expressed significant concern regarding the Welsh Government's decision to end its work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on the childcare offer. Sian Gwenllian highlighted the frustration that arose because the committee had extensively scrutinized the matter, raised concerns, and was assured by the previous Minister that HMRC would deliver according to Welsh language standards.\n\nJulie Morgan explained that the decision was based on the principle of wanting a more flexible and expandable offer, which HMRC would restrict. She said that including training and education would not be possible via HMRC and would have to be done by local authorities.\n\nNicola Edwards added that the technical issues, such as bilingual provision and Welsh language standards, also contributed to the decision. HMRC's bilingual service operates under a scheme, which differs from the requirements of the Welsh language standards.\n\nJo-anne Daniels stated that the costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than initially outlined. The Welsh Government concluded that working with local authorities would be cheaper and provide greater flexibility, with the investment staying in Wales.",
    "The professor's comments were as follows:\n\n*   **Workshop:** The professor suggested having a kick-off meeting.\n*   **Team's feedback on the person in Grenada:** The professor was curious about the identity of the person in Grenada. He was interested in exploring ways to combine noise removal techniques with other methods.\n*   **Required elements in the new form arrangement:** There was no mention of any changes to the form arrangements.\n*   **Suggested structure of the belief net:** The professor suggested that the discussion should include alternatives, what has been seen so far, and some game plans.\n*   **Grad B's opinion on the belief net structure:** Grad B presented an initial idea of all features pointing to the output node, but it was considered unsatisfactory due to the complexity of setting up probabilities. Grad B then proposed adding a middle layer with hidden variables like whether someone was on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, Grad E's work focused on implementing mean log magnitude spectral subtraction into the SmartKom system. Grad E conducted tests using varying time windows for calculating the mean, exploring the impact on performance. Grad E seemed concerned with the practical implications of their approach in an interactive system, questioning whether the models used matter and how much time is used to calculate the mean.\n\nGrad A was working on experiments to determine the effectiveness of intermediate categories for speech recognition. They planned to use perfect knowledge of voicing to improve phone recognition in a hybrid framework. Grad A aimed to complete these experiments by the time of their quals in July. Grad A was also interested in extending this work to digits to observe inter-phoneme events, indicating a goal of understanding the broader context of phoneme occurrences.",
    "The User Interface (UI) team initially presented prototypes based on fruit shapes (banana and tomato). They favored a design with minimal buttons, with additional buttons accessible by flipping the remote over. They also suggested scroll buttons for channel and volume control, but were concerned about accidental activation. The UI team emphasized user-friendliness and considered the needs of both younger and older users.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a single-curved, rubbery remote control with a focus on simplicity and trendiness. The final design included an LCD screen, speech recognition capabilities, and the company's slogan and colors. While the UI team initially leaned towards radio wave technology for broader usability, concerns about cost (3-5 times more expensive than infrared) and potential interference led to a preference for infrared technology. The team decided to use an off-the-shelf component for the radio wave circuit, if that technology was used. The extra budget was not specifically allocated, but the team remained open to adding features if deemed worthwhile, like speech recognition.\n",
    "The professor discussed several aspects related to noise and speech processing. He mentioned that low-frequency noise, like that from an air conditioner, can appear in waveforms, even masking room reverberation effects. However, he noted that simple filtering can remove this specific noise without requiring advanced methods.\n\nHe mentioned using a high-pass filter option in Feacalc, based on the RASTA-PLP program, with a cutoff frequency around 20 Hz. This filter is mild and doesn't significantly affect speech frequencies. He also raised the question of whether this high-pass filter is used consistently in Feacalc.\n\nRegarding additive noise, he acknowledged that distant microphones pick up more noise and that spectral subtraction is a method being explored to address this. He also mentioned the potential for spectral subtraction to increase the variance of certain features.",
    "The group discussed the function and object of the remote control, specifically the kinetic function and the ability to roll through the user's favorite channels. The kinetic function, which involved some kind of hand dynamo to power the remote, was considered but ultimately deemed too costly and not fitting within the cost profile. There was also discussion about rechargeable batteries and docking stations.\n\nThe ability to roll through the user's favorite channels was explored as a potential feature. The idea was that users could program their favorite channels into the remote, and then use a scroll wheel or some other mechanism to quickly navigate through them. This feature was seen as potentially appealing to television surfers, but there were concerns about the cost and complexity of implementing it.\n",
    "The team proposed a design for demographic marketing strategies that incorporates trendy designs, specifically targeting the youth market (18-35 year olds). They will use recognizable colors and shapes to aid feature recognition. They also want to use multiple case colors, and will copy Apple's color scheme. The team also agreed on a simple design with voice recognition built in. \n\nIndustrial Design will work on the basic look and feel of the non-remote remote, while User Interface will figure out the best layout for the simple design with voice recognition, drop-down, or side menu options. Marketing will research the trends in remote control casings.\n\nMarketing expressed that they like the design and that the base station with the remote locator is a marketable feature.\n",
    "Grad G expressed enthusiasm for Fey's hiring, referring to her as the \"Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nRegarding intention capture, Grad G raised the point that subjects should have a clear intention, which the new data collection methodology was designed to address.\n\nThe professor did not comment on MSG.\n\nOn the pronunciation of \"zero,\" it was noted that there are two pronunciations: \"zero\" and \"O.\" The decision was made to allow subjects to pronounce it as they naturally would. The forms were changed from spelling out which one to read to allow for this.",
    "The Industrial Designer expressed several thoughts on the appearance design, technology, and features of the remote control. \n\nRegarding appearance, the Industrial Designer agreed with the idea of an attractive, streamlined remote control, and that current styles are awful.\n\nIn terms of technology, the Industrial Designer was initially unsure about speech recognition due to cost concerns but was open to discussing it. They also expressed concern about incorporating Bluetooth or radio waves, suggesting that while incorporating Bluetooth into a placeholder connected to the TV was a nice idea, it would still require infrared functionality. They were also wary of a touch screen, because it is not the same as touching a button. They also stated that they were not convinced that the speech recognition could be included for the price that needed to be hit.\n\nThe Industrial Designer focused on the practicalities and cost-effectiveness of the remote control's components, suggesting that it should be a cheap, mass-produced device that can be easily replaced if it malfunctions.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts primarily focus on education in Wales. Discussions covered the curriculum changes and how to ensure standards don't slip. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders discussed the cycle of inspections for regional consortia. Jassa Scott noted that regional consortia aren't statutory entities, and Estyn doesn't have specific inspection powers, but they take a thematic approach.\n\nThe discussion did not mention the priority of inspections, the reopening of the House of Commons in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations, or the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism. The transcripts also did not mention Justin Trudeau's elaboration on the governmental fund and his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions when discussing the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism.\n",
    "The group discussed technical and functional designs, along with specific design requirements. The project manager opened the discussion to allow the team to provide their ideas for the remote control. The team decided that the remote control should be trendy, original, and user-friendly. The team discussed the user interface, the number of buttons, and whether or not the remote should be lighted. The team also talked about how the remote should resist shocks and potentially be waterproof.\n\nThe industrial designer was tasked with finding out more about the industrial design, and the user interface designer was tasked with thinking about the number of buttons, the lighting, and what would be convenient for the user. The marketing expert was tasked with finding out what the absolute requirements were for a remote control.",
    "The team's discussion of the project's process, work division, and production plan reveals both positive and negative aspects.\n\nRegarding the process, the team generally felt there was room for creativity, particularly in the prototype making. However, one member felt stifled by the initial restriction to a TV remote. Teamwork was considered good, though roles were not strictly defined. The team also touched on the means and materials used, expressing mixed feelings about digital pens and PowerPoint presentations. Access to information varied across roles, with some feeling they had to \"make up\" information due to limitations. New ideas emerged through the process, and the team seemed to converge on a satisfactory product.\n\nRegarding the production plan, the discussion centered on cost considerations, particularly whether the final product could be produced within the twelve fifty Euro budget. Decisions were made regarding battery type (lithium) and the number of interfaces needed. The team evaluated the product against criteria such as ease of use, fashionability, feel, technological innovation, and trendiness.\n",
    "The group discussed future directions, mentioning the need to find a way to plug their system into the OGI system, focusing on using the VAD labels and final features. They discussed training targets, including articulatory features, and combining this with approaches like multi-band training on a lot of noises. The group also mentioned they would be working on multi-band MLP trainings and Finnish.\n\nPhD D explained the multilingual model, noting that the TIMIT network is the best but there is the effect of changing language and training on something that's Viterbi-aligned instead of hand-labeled.\n\nPhD C asked about experiments using data from multiple languages to train the neural net.\n\nThe group also discussed releasing the meeting data and providing people an opportunity to review the transcripts and remove sensitive information. They discussed the need to get something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this. Adam was going to email everyone to inform them that the data would be released on July 15 and to indicate a specific time by which they would need to respond.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement highlights a critical issue regarding the effectiveness of government programs. She is pointing out that there's often a disconnect between the development of a program on paper and its actual implementation in the real world. While a program might be well-intentioned and designed to address a specific need, challenges arise when it comes to putting it into practice.\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this gap manifests as single parents relying on spousal support and child maintenance being excluded from receiving the necessary support. Despite the awareness and discussions surrounding this issue, concrete action to bridge this gap has been lacking, leaving vulnerable individuals without the assistance they desperately need. This implies that the program's design or eligibility criteria may not adequately address the complexities of real-life situations, or that the implementation process is facing unforeseen hurdles.\n",
    "The Project Manager believed the last meeting review and market research indicated they were \"on the right track.\" They agreed with the user interface designer that speech recognition might not be worth the investment, at least not yet. The Project Manager thought a tracking device would be a good idea, especially if they went with the ball design. They felt that the group was making good progress to determine the remote's functions.\n\nHowever, the group felt there was not enough time between meetings to complete their tasks. The group also felt the project should focus on a specific target group, which would help determine a form factor.\n\nThe group had mixed feelings about using a panther as a drawing. The marketing member liked it, but the industrial designer thought it would be difficult to draw.\n",
    "The team had a variety of ideas regarding the remote control's features.\n\n**Buttons for multiple operations:** The Industrial Designer suggested buttons for multiple operations to reduce the total number of buttons. However, the Marketing Expert thought one button should correspond to one function to simplify the remote and shorten the learning curve.\n\n**LCD screen:** The team agreed that an LCD screen was a technologically innovative feature. The Industrial Designer and Marketing Expert thought that the LCD screen should be placed at the top of the remote control to make it more familiar, while the User Interface Designer preferred the bottom to keep the shape recognizable.\n\n**Microphone position:** The team explored different positions for the microphone, such as underneath or on the bottom of the remote. There was a consensus that the microphone should be placed where it isn't easily seen.\n\n**Push-buttons:** The Industrial Designer acknowledged that push-buttons are out of trend. The User Interface Designer suggested push-buttons for the channel numbers, while the Industrial Designer thought that an LCD screen would allow the selection of almost everything.\n",
    "The tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures and provincial travel restrictions, which severely impacted operators, especially seasonal and rural businesses. The government took several measures to mitigate these effects. They announced investments to offset financial losses in the tourism industry, with a focus on encouraging domestic tourism through destination marketing organizations.\n\nFinancial support was provided through programs like the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) and the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) to help businesses cover costs. The government also worked with the provinces to come up with an approach that would provide an incentive for landlords to give a rent reduction to commercial tenants. For the tourism sector in the Atlantic provinces, the government worked with the chambers of commerce and Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador for the tourism sector.\n\nThese measures aimed to provide immediate financial relief, support business operations, and prepare the industry for recovery once restrictions eased.\n",
    "The team discussed the design of a new remote control, focusing on creating a trendy, user-friendly, and original product. It was decided to limit the remote's functionality to TVs to keep the design simple and ensure a quick market release.\n\nThe team decided to use a long-lasting battery source for simplicity of manufacturing and maintenance. A custom chip will be used, but with reduced functions to address technological innovation.\n\nThe team agreed on an interchangeable case design to make the remote a fashion item. The design will incorporate a scroll for volume control on the left and buttons for channel up and down on the right. A prominent power button will also be included. Voice activation will be included. The corporate logo will be prominently displayed. The remote's shape will be designed for easy handling and recognition.",
    "The DARPA meeting is scheduled for mid-July, and the goal is to be in production mode by then, having a transcription stream running and knowing how well it operates. For the DARPA meeting, they want to be able to say that a subset of the data is available.\n\nThe contents of the paper included three sections: the amount of overlap in terms of the number of words, a \"spurt,\" and the effects of overlaps on recognition performance. A spurt is a stretch of speech with no pauses exceeding 500 milliseconds. The paper also discussed cases where someone else starts a sentence during overlapping speech.\n\nThe statistics included the amount of overlap in Meeting Recorder meetings, Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. The Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap. Switchboard and CallHome were roughly the same, and the Robustness meetings had the least. The paper also included statistics on how overlaps affect the recognition performance. After removing regions of background speech, the recognition error went down to almost the level of the non-overlapped speech. They found that after a discourse marker, backchannel, or filled pause, you are more likely to be interrupted than before.",
    "The group agreed to train and test the digits corpus using various techniques. They acknowledged limitations of the current HTK-based system compared to the SRI system with a large amount of data. They discussed the impact of adaptation and VTL estimation.\n\nProgress included exploring different features (PLP, JRASTA, MSG), training sets (TIMIT, multilingual), and network configurations. They identified issues with online normalization and MSG features.\n\nDelays were mainly caused by the need to retrain nets, identify the best features, and the limited availability of resources. The group also discussed the need to test the models on a range of different tests.\n",
    "In the product naming discussion, \"triple R\" was favored over \"triple RC\" because the \"RC\" together detracted from the image of it being a \"triple\" product, whereas \"triple R\" gave the impression of a triple remote control.\n\nThe team concluded that the target age group should be young professionals, specifically those aged 15 to 35, with a focus on the 25-35 range. This was based on market research indicating that this demographic is more likely to adopt new technologies, has more disposable income, and is familiar with computers and gadgets.\n\nThe marketing team decided to target young people because they are typically the early adopters of new devices.\n\nRegarding channel selection, the team discussed the need for a straightforward method to access channels, including the possibility of a numerical keypad or a menu-based system on the L_C_D_ screen. There was also a discussion about customizable channel lists for quick access to frequently watched channels.\n",
    "The group discussed market research findings indicating a preference for fancy aesthetics over functionality in remote controls. They considered design trends like fruit/vegetable themes and spongy materials.\n\nFeature discussions included touch screen LCD remotes, conventional push-button designs with integrated functionality (one-button startup for multiple devices), gaming features (joysticks, camera angle controls), and voice recognition. The group explored power source options like standard batteries, solar charging, and kinetic charging, weighing their compatibility, cost, and user convenience.\n\nDesign opinions varied from shell-like shapes to biomorphic forms, with a focus on ergonomics and comfort. The team debated materials like plastic, titanium, and rubber, considering their impact on shape, cost, and feel. They also evaluated the possibility of customizable rubber covers and discussed the placement and type of buttons (rubberized, bare PCB, or LCD screen), aiming for a balance of simplicity and innovation.\n\nRevolutionizing remote control interaction was a key theme, with the group exploring minimal button designs, intuitive interfaces, and the potential for voice control. They considered the need to target a younger, tech-savvy demographic while ensuring ease of use for all users.\n",
    "During the meeting, Kirsty Williams AM discussed the following key points:\n\n*   **Quality Assurance:** Williams stated she was aware of concerns regarding the proposal for a single quality assessment body and assured that the quality assurance regime would not risk the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities. The framework would be compatible with ENQA.\n*   **High-Risk Category:** Bethan Owen mentioned that one university was in the high-risk category, five in the medium category, and two in the low category.\n*   **Five Principles:** Kirsty Williams AM outlined five principles to guide decisions on reopening schools: safety and well-being, alignment with the wider Welsh Government response, clear communication to parents and staff, determining which groups of children should access more education, and ensuring safe operationalization.\n*   **New Examinations and School Qualifications:** She stated that A-level and GCSE results days would proceed as normal, and teachers would submit grades based on their professional judgment, which would then be moderated by Qualifications Wales.\n*   **Response to Doubts:** In response to concerns about insufficient action, Williams emphasized that the principles were clear, and schools would only move to a new phase when it was safe, with sufficient planning and time given to the sector. She also noted ongoing collaboration with other nations and educationalists.",
    "The team generally liked the final product's design and potential marketability. The marketing representative felt they did a good job choosing what they wanted to do with the remote, and the project manager liked having a say in how technologically advanced and fashionable it should be. The team also enjoyed the teamwork aspect of the project. They liked using the laptops and shared network.\n\nHowever, there were some dislikes. The industrial designer felt creatively stifled by the initial restriction to only create a TV remote. The user interface representative was not fond of the fact that the remote was only for TV use, limiting its broader appeal.\n",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments primarily revolved around its impact on word error rate and signal characteristics. One participant observed an improvement in word error rate when training on a specific dataset using PZM F with mean subtraction, but a worsening in near-mike performance. It was theorized that the SRI system's channel adaptation, which includes mean subtraction, might be normalizing the channel in a way that boosted HTK's performance in a previous experiment, but introduced artifacts in the SRI case.\n\nAnother point raised was that mean subtraction seemed to make PZM signals louder, potentially acting as a form of gain control. While simply amplifying the signal wouldn't affect the signal-to-noise ratio, it was suggested that mean subtraction might be improving the signal-to-noise ratio, thus leading to better performance. Concerns were raised about whether the mean normalization could be causing a better signal-to-noise ratio due to spikes in the PZM data. Ultimately, it was acknowledged that the impact of mean subtraction was complex and could depend on factors such as normalization procedures and signal characteristics.\n",
    "The meetings included a discussion of mixed signals and noise processing, leading to a new VAD neural network using noise-compensated MFCC features. This resulted in a 57.02% improvement, but with a 220ms latency. The group explored methods to reduce latency, including adjusting delta computation windows, potentially achieving under 200ms. They discussed postdoc A's opinion of new headphones.\n\nRegarding VAD results, the new system was better than previous ones but slightly worse than an idealized VAD. The group also talked about alternative methods to increase space.\n\nThe deadline for the evaluation is November 15th.",
    "Special schools are expected to continue providing support, especially for vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. The same principles apply to special schools as to mainstream schools regarding key workers' children and vulnerable pupils. Even with a minority of children attending, the support is deemed necessary.\n\nThe regional consortia are involved in ensuring plans are in place for children with ALN, working with social services to ensure no child falls through the gaps. In the event of some children being moved to different schools, it is unlikely special school pupils would be catered for in a different setting due to the nature of special schools. The provision would be catered for within the original school.",
    "The industrial designer introduced the prototype as a handheld device molded to the shape of the user's hand, featuring a scroll for volume on the left and buttons for channels up and down on the right. The power key was designed to be the largest for easy identification. The device would use infrared to send signals, working whether pointed directly or held upwards. The prototype would be made of lightweight plastic with a rubbery cover, similar to iPod covers, for protection and a spongy feel.\n\nThe team discussed making the base wider so it could stand vertically, which was considered a minor detail but important for fashion. The possibility of lengthening it for better grip and flattening the base for stability were also considered. The project manager mentioned the possibility of a universal remote, one for a stereo and one for a DVD player. The project manager wanted a standard chip to be used.\n",
    "During the prototype design and evaluation discussions, the Industrial Designer made several comments regarding the appearance, structure, and customer preferences.\n\n*   **Appearance:** The Industrial Designer suggested the remote should have a special case made of strong, recyclable, and colorful plastic. They also specified that the prototype was blue with yellow buttons, and the LED should be fluorescent green.\n\n*   **Structure:** The designer emphasized the importance of the remote fitting easily into the hands, allowing easy access to all buttons. The buttons themselves should be made of soft rubber for a comfortable touch.\n\n*   **Customer Preferences:** In later discussions, the Industrial Designer noted market research indicating a preference for a spongy material and a fruit or vegetable shape. They also mentioned the potential for interchangeable covers, appealing to trendy people and children who could customize them.",
    "The meetings do not provide an overview of the allocation of the $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Hon. Karen Vecchio raised the question regarding the $75 million allocated towards sexual exploitation and human trafficking, inquiring where the money has gone, and stating that organizations have had to close their doors and programs, but was only provided with a response that a strategy has been launched.\n\nRegarding the solution to risk appetite, HEFCW has helped institutions to rethink some of their aspirations and will ask questions when things look too optimistic. HEFCW does not say no because the institutions are autonomous, but they try to make sure that they are asking the right questions.\n\nHon. Michael Barrett stated that the Indian Act enshrined racism into Canadian law in 1876, and, through residential schools, the child welfare system, our legal system and our police, we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples. The deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi and the assault on Chief Allan Adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the RCMP.\n",
    "The segmenter, presumably Thilo's segmenter, is working well with high recall, which is beneficial for training noise models in the recognizer. The team wants to move to doing recognition on automatic segmentations instead of hand-segmentations for meeting recognition experiments. A sample meeting was sent to the transcribers with Thilo's segmentation applied, to see if it fixes the problem of too many beeps in the last transcription. There is a plan to use the transcriptions to create speech/non-speech labels for the segmentation work.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) designer and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price during the interactive evaluation because the Industrial Designer thought the device should be pretty cheap, while the UI designer thought it would be a little more expensive due to the need for someone skilled in menu programming. The UI designer disagreed with the redesign after product evaluation because they felt that if users disliked the initial design, there would not be a second chance.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because those were the company colors. The marketing team disagreed with the UI designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance, because the marketing team thought there was too much red and the shape was not a pineapple.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil expressed reservations about the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment. Dafydd Evans stated employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac and suggested the Skills Challenge Certificate is a better title. Nick Brazil noted employers rarely request the Welsh bac, focusing instead on professional qualifications and skills. He added the Welsh bac has become overly rigorous and bureaucratic, questioning its ability to develop necessary skills. Kay Martin echoed these sentiments, stating employers prioritize core qualifications (e.g., engineering certifications) alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. All three agreed the initial vision for the Welsh bac was sound, but it has lost its way.\n",
    "The team discussed additional ideas and presentations on the function and working design of the product. The user interface designer suggested the remote should have basic functions such as on/off, channel up/down, and volume control. The marketing representative emphasized the importance of simplicity and a modern, eye-catching design, while also suggesting that speech recognition could be a marketable feature. The industrial designer focused on the technical aspects, including the power source, smart chip, and the need for a large on/off button.\n\nAdditional ideas included a homing device to help users find the remote when lost, a charging base similar to a portable phone, and the potential for voice recognition to cater to a broader demographic, including individuals with disabilities. The team also considered the layout of the buttons and categorized them into device functions, audio settings, and video settings. The team also decided to restrict the remote control to only controlling the television and not other devices. The team agreed to target the product at young professionals between the ages of 15 and 35.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager had several key thoughts regarding the new remote control.\n\n**Market Range, Price, and Target Groups:** The Project Manager emphasized that the selling price had to be around twenty-five Euros, with a production cost of no more than twelve and a half Euros. They aimed for an international market, focusing on different cultures and trends. The initial target audience was broad, potentially anyone under sixty, but later narrowed to those who might be replacing remotes and have some disposable income.\n\n**New Features:** The Project Manager acknowledged the appeal of features like a multipurpose remote, but was concerned about production costs, especially regarding waterproof features or advanced components like those needed for an L_C_D_.\n\n**Feasibility of Multipurpose Remote:** While seeing the convenience of a multipurpose remote, they stressed the importance of user-friendliness and basic functionality.\n\n**Cost Constraints and Financial Targets:** The Project Manager repeatedly highlighted the cost constraints, emphasizing the need to balance innovative features with the budget. They acknowledged the profit aim of fifty million Euros, contingent on selling a large volume of remotes.\n\n**Selling Target:** The Project Manager understood the necessity of establishing the sales target to better understand how large the market must be to meet the profit goal.\n\n**Setting the Selling Target:** The Project Manager set a selling target of 2 million remotes to be sold based on the project's goals.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) had several thoughts regarding the project's constraints. UI noted that the project was limited by a 25 Euro selling price and a production cost of no more than 12.50 Euros. UI noted that the biggest cost saving measure would be to remove voice recognition.\n\nRegarding financial targets, UI acknowledged that to meet the company's profit aim of 50 million Euros, at least four million units would need to be sold. UI also mentioned that shape and color were areas where they shouldn't compromise, implying that these were important features that could drive sales.\n\nRegarding kinetic batteries, UI initially supported them, suggesting they could be attached to the flipping open and shut mechanism of the remote. However, UI later questioned the need for them, stating that customers hadn't specifically requested them. UI suggested that a regular battery would be acceptable, especially if it helped to meet the cost constraints, as customers are used to buying batteries for remote controls.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements on several product ideas. The Industrial Designer seemed opposed to the idea of making the product upgradable, as it would require more buttons. Marketing suggested the product be upgradable and have a card to change the warranty concept. The Industrial Designer also did not like the idea of kinetic energy because they did not think the target demographic of older people would want to shake the remote to power it up. The Industrial Designer also thought that voice recognition and an LCD screen would go hand-in-hand, but Marketing stated that earlier market research showed that a large LCD screen would be preferable.\n",
    "HEFCW's powers of intervention, including the current situation and conversations with FE and HE about closure decisions, were discussed in the second meeting.\n\nThe Minister expressed that the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 provided HEFCW with new powers of intervention and sanctions in cases of non-compliance by institutions. However, HEFCW suggested that their powers were inflexible and hard to use, calling them \"threatening\" and making sanctions difficult to implement. They explained that they often take informal measures due to the small size of the sector, enabling good relationships. The Minister stated that she would want to ensure that the new tertiary education body has sufficiently flexible and soft regulatory powers, including advice and guidance rather than punitive interventions, and enhanced monitoring.\n\nRegarding closures, the Minister stated that Universities are autonomous institutions and have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and the colleges are in a similar position. \n",
    "The group plans to create a universal remote control to be sold internationally for twenty-five Euros, aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. The design should be fashionable, user-friendly, and sleek, targeting a broad audience while keeping production costs at twelve and a half Euros.\n\nKey aspects of their marketing strategy include:\n\n*   **Universal Compatibility:** The remote should work with various devices (TVs, DVD players, microwaves, front doors) and formats (NTSC, PAL).\n*   **Design and Materials:** The remote should have a high-quality feel, potentially using materials and aesthetics similar to Apple products. It should fit comfortably in the hand.\n*   **Customization:** The possibility of changeable faceplates and color customization will be explored to make the remote trendy and appealing.\n*   **User Experience:** The remote should balance multifunctionality with ease of use, potentially incorporating a touchscreen or a locator device to prevent loss.\n*   **Market Research:** The team will consider competitor products and consumer preferences to determine the optimal design and features for the target market.",
