    "The group identified two distinct revisions.\n\n1. Technical / logistical change  \n   \u2022 They had expected an eight\u2013CPU IBM Linux box for model-training, but only two 550 MHz processors had been delivered.  \n   \u2022 Until IBM ships the remaining boards the team must \u201cpopulate the machine\u201d themselves: port the neural-net and HTK training scripts to Linux, test dual-processor threading, and be ready to scale to 5\u20138 CPUs when the hardware finally arrives.  \n   \u2022 Professor B agreed, stressing that time should be spent now on debugging under the present two-CPU configuration so the machine is useful the moment the additional processors appear.\n\n2. Procedural / data-collection change  \n   \u2022 Recruitment letters and release forms for the tourist-dialogue corpus had been drafted in German; subjects, however, will be a mixed Bay-Area pool.  \n   \u2022 The professor insisted the working documents, task sheets and consent forms be rewritten in clear English, with German kept only inside the spoken prompts where it is linguistically necessary.  He also wanted a separate one-line waiver (\u201cI do not need to review the final transcript\u201d) added so most participants can simply sign and leave, avoiding the legally required \u201cright to excise\u201d step that would slow processing.  \n   \u2022 The group therefore must (a) translate and simplify the task list, keeping a single exemplar of each activity class (e.g. zoo / castle / tour = \u201ctour big-ish place\u201d), (b) clean up the English template grammar so the new parser accepts idiomatic questions (\u201cWhich films are on tonight?\u201d instead of literal German order), and (c) circulate the revised English packet to Jane, Fey and the recruiting classes before subjects begin next week.\n\nIn short, the hardware side needs the IBM box readied for parallel training, while the human-data side needs every outward-facing document converted to straightforward English and the extra waiver line added.",
    "The team agreed that maintaining explicit User and Situation models is essential because it lets them separate stable, user-specific factors from transient, contextual ones and then feed each class of information into the decision network in a controlled way.  For every low-level action node (e.g., Go-There or Endpoint) they plan to create two parallel \u201cexpert\u201d nodes\u2014one labelled \u201c-U\u201d for the User model and one labelled \u201c-S\u201d for the Situation model.  This symmetry keeps the conditional-probability tables small and makes it clear which evidence came from where; later a higher-level node will combine the two \u201cvotes\u201d, together with discourse and ontology inputs.\n\nWithin the User model they distinguished enduring traits from running resources.  \u201cFinance\u201d (cheap/average/spendy) expresses the traveller\u2019s general spending style, while \u201cBudget\u201d is a numeric value that decays as the trip progresses.  Because Budget changes after every purchase, it must be updated outside the belief net and then pushed in as an observed value.  They discussed two implementation issues: (1) how finely to discretise the number into ranges that matter for a given decision, and (2) whether belief propagation should occur every time the budget changes or only when a node that uses it is queried.\n\nThe Situation model will hold rapidly changing facts such as strikes, opening hours, or weather.  The group noted that a single situation node may be insufficient; different preconditions (e.g., \u201cIs it open?\u201d versus \u201cIs the path blocked?\u201d) might require separate inputs that are then summarised before reaching the decision node.\n\nFinally, to avoid combinatorial explosion, they proposed collapsing large sets of user factors\u2014budget, time, energy\u2014into a single \u201ccompatibility\u201d measure that many decisions can reuse, thereby preserving the value of the User and Situation models while keeping the network tractable.",
    "Throughout the sittings members repeatedly pressed the government to clarify the state of a \u201cCanadian economy in limbo\u201d and to justify massive emergency spending undertaken without a formal fiscal update.\n\n\u2022  Cathy McLeod (CPC) argued that the absence of an economic statement was heightening uncertainty.  Revenues were already falling before COVID-19, yet \u201cParliament and Canadians still don\u2019t know how much money is coming in or going out.\u201d  She pointed to provincial updates\u2014New Brunswick, Quebec, Saskatchewan\u2014as proof that credible projections are possible, and called it \u201cshameful\u201d that Ottawa preferred \u201ca question-but-no-answer period\u201d to normal parliamentary scrutiny.  McLeod also warned that sectors such as forestry were in crisis well before the pandemic, and that continuing to legislate and spend without clear numbers or sector-specific plans risked compounding the damage.\n\n\u2022  Minister Mona Fortier replied for the government.  She acknowledged that the economy is going through \u201ca period of extraordinary uncertainty,\u201d but contended that meaningful forecasts are impossible until the path of the pandemic is clearer.  In her view the government is already \u201copen and transparent,\u201d citing bi-weekly cost reports to Parliament, hundreds of program adjustments, and a promise to table a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d statement \u201cas soon as it\u2019s possible to provide clear projections.\u201d  Until then, she said, Ottawa\u2019s priority must remain delivering wage subsidies, CERB, rent relief and other stabilization measures.\n\n\u2022  Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois finance critic Gabriel Ste-Marie accepted that emergency action is needed, but criticized the way it is being delivered.  He warned that, without firm rules, the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility could funnel public money to multinationals that legally shift profits to tax havens.  Ste-Marie also faulted the government for ignoring excessive credit-card interchange fees that hurt merchants and consumers during the downturn.  For him, any recovery plan must exclude tax-avoiders and curb financial sector windfalls.\n\nTogether the exchanges underscored cross-party concern about economic opacity, differing views on when a full update is feasible, and debate over whether emergency programs are equitable and properly conditioned.",
    "The industrial designer, Xavier Juergens, sketched a tiger and pulled out four specific traits he felt were worth translating into the new television-remote design.\n\n1. Strength and robustness.  He described the tiger as \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cstrong,\u201d implying the remote should project durability and reliability even though it will be made from lightweight materials.\n\n2. Strategic, well-planned action.  Juergens stressed that a tiger \u201chunts for prey \u2026 always in a very well-thought way.\u201d  He wants the remote\u2019s control layout to mirror that deliberateness\u2014functions should be placed so users can reach their target quickly and intuitively rather than by trial-and-error.\n\n3. Security and stealth.  He noted the tiger \u201calways goes for security,\u201d first seeking a hiding spot before striking.  In product terms, that translates into protecting sensitive components, concealing screws or seams, and keeping the overall appearance clean and uncluttered while still delivering quick access when needed.\n\n4. Distinctive visual identity.  While apologizing for his drawing, he pointed out \u201cthese are stripes,\u201d recognizing the tiger\u2019s instantly recognizable pattern.  He suggested a similarly bold\u2014but simple\u2014graphic or textural cue so the remote will stand out on a coffee table and in the marketplace.\n\nThus, the characteristics he considered worth studying were the tiger\u2019s power, strategic intelligence, emphasis on security/stealth, and its iconic striped look\u2014qualities he believes can guide a remote that feels solid, operates logically, safeguards its internals, and remains visually memorable.",
    "The group feels the current Tcl/Tk \u201cTranscriber\u201d interface is serviceable but imposes several serious bottlenecks.  Its biggest weakness is that it treats meetings as single-channel audio: overlaps can be labeled, but the tool will not let a transcriber mark separate start- and end-times for each participant.  Only one waveform can be displayed; loading another channel waveform forces a lengthy redraw, so switching views while working on an overlap is \u201cpainfully slow.\u201d  Choosing which channel to listen to also requires pulling down a menu every time, which the transcribers say interrupts their rhythm.  Because of these constraints they have settled for coarse overlap coding and then tighten boundaries later, a compromise everyone would like to eliminate.\n\nSeveral fixes were proposed.  Dave Gelbart offered to hack Transcriber so the mixed waveform stays on screen while the user edits time tags for any channel, selectable by a simple click rather than a menu.  Dan Ellis\u2019 earlier hack already lets users audition different channels; extending it to produce separate output files per channel would both preserve overlaps accurately and satisfy downstream needs for clean single-channel audio.\n\nAt the same time the team canvassed alternative tools.  Munich\u2019s in-house annotator and Susanne Burger\u2019s eight-channel Windows program were mentioned; Munich will not release theirs, but Burger\u2019s might be usable if Windows machines are supplied.  Praat was examined but judged probably unsuitable for multi-channel, meeting-style work.  X-Waves was floated as a stop-gap for viewing several short, pre-segmented waveforms, yet most felt that a \u201cmusical-score\u201d style, multi-lane display\u2014either by extending Transcriber or writing something new\u2014remains the long-term goal.",
    "The three presentations converged on a fashionable-yet-practical remote that keeps costs near the \u20ac25 target.\n\nComponents & materials\u2028\nThe Industrial Designer reviewed case shapes (flat, single-curved, double-curved) and materials (plastic, rubber, latex, titanium, wood). A single or double curve in plastic clad with hard rubber/latex was preferred: it survives drops, gives a soft \u201cspongy\u201d grip, and allows bright colours. Titanium and wood were deemed either cold, heavy or brittle; latex rules out solar cells, so energy will come from a standard AA cell topped up by a kinetic charger. Internally, a cheap printed-circuit board and a simple IC suffice because the team dropped the LCD. A tiny beeper will help locate the remote when lost.\n\nUser-interface specification\u2028\nUsability studies showed viewers use only a handful of keys, so the UI will feature large power, channel and volume buttons plus ten numeric keys and a Menu key. Advanced settings (contrast, tuning, parental profiles) appear on the TV screen rather than on the handset, eliminating the need for an on-board display or scroll wheel and keeping the chip simple. Voice recognition and log-in control are \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d that may be enabled in software later.\n\nMarket & trend findings\u2028\nMarketing research ranks purchase motives as: 1) fancy look & feel, 2) new technology, 3) ease of use (each half as important as the previous). Fashion scouts in Paris and Milan report \u201cfruits, vegetables and spongy textures\u201d dominate  this year. Younger buyers want bright, tactile colours; seniors favour darker, traditional shades. Removable rubber covers in fruit colours with an optional sombre version satisfy both segments and echo the mobile-phone market\u2019s success with changeable shells.\n\nIn short, the agreed concept is a robust, curved plastic/ rubber remote powered by battery + kinetic boost, with minimal hard keys, TV-based menus, optional parental profiles and a range of trendy, fruit-coloured skins.",
    "Members were told that piloting the childcare offer in seven \u201cearly implementer\u201d authorities has been invaluable.  Overall delivery is \u201cgoing well\u201d, allowing the Government to extend pilots to whole authorities in Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly, with Flintshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Swansea next.  The Minister highlighted several lessons:\n\n\u2022  Administration is the biggest headache.  Local teams are spending large amounts of time checking wage slips, birth certificates and changing work patterns.  This favours a single, HMRC-style national digital system that shares data with DWP and relieves councils and parents of paperwork before full roll-out in 2020.\n\n\u2022  Eligibility boundaries confuse families.  Parents just outside pilot wards, or in non-covered parts of pilot counties, cannot understand why neighbours qualify while they do not.  Clearer communication and quicker geographic expansion are needed.\n\n\u2022  Demand is uneven.  Differences reflect both economics and culture: in some south-Wales Valleys many families still rely on grandparents, while other pilot zones have been swamped with applications.  Targeted marketing and flexible local planning will be required.\n\n\u2022  Capacity is not yet a barrier; Welsh-medium settings, provision for disabled children and rural areas have generally coped.  Nonetheless, workforce and premises gaps are emerging, so the \u00a360 million capital fund and 10-year staffing plan must stay aligned with pilot feedback.\n\n\u2022  The flat \u00a34.50 hourly rate is currently acceptable, but Cardiff and Newport are being added specifically to test whether higher-cost urban markets require a supplement.\n\nBecause of these insights, the Minister remains \u201cvery confident\u201d that a national service can be delivered on time and within the projected \u00a3100 million budget.",
    "The Project Manager consistently evaluated every feature against usability and the 12.5 \u20ac production ceiling.\n\nSpeech / voice recognition  \n\u2022 Found the in-house \u201ctalking coffee-machine\u201d module amusing but \u201ccompletely pointless\u201d for a TV remote.  \n\u2022 Worried that keyword spotting would need hundreds of prerecorded phrases, drive cost, and still mis-recognise words competing with TV audio.  \n\u2022 Concluded the technology is \u201cnot mature enough,\u201d would delay the schedule, and therefore ruled it out for the first prototype (\u201cmaybe the next one, but skip it now\u201d).\n\nGeneral technology stance  \n\u2022 Welcomed \u201cfancy\u201d elements only if they added clear value and fitted the budget.  \n\u2022 Preferred re-using components already available in-house (e.g., scroll wheels) rather than funding fresh R & D.\n\nCost constraints  \n\u2022 Reiterated that manufacturing cost must stay below 12.5 \u20ac to hit a 25 \u20ac retail price; any feature pushing the figure higher had to be removed.  \n\u2022 When the team exceeded cost, he dropped speech recognition and optional coloured covers before touching core functions.\n\nLCD screen  \n\u2022 Initially doubted an LCD because it adds price, uses space \u201ca banana can\u2019t spare,\u201d and duplicates TV feedback.  \n\u2022 Later accepted a small monochrome LCD as justifiable \u201cmore useful than speech recognition\u201d provided the rest of the design stayed on budget.  \n\u2022 Admitted the LCD would be under-used in the current concept but could host menus, channel lists or previews in future.\n\nButton design  \n\u2022 Advocated a \u201cminimal-button\u201d philosophy: one power switch, two scroll wheels (channel, volume), a turbo-scan button, and very few traditional keys for legacy users.  \n\u2022 Emphasised ergonomic placement\u2014wheels at thumb level\u2014and warned that too many buttons would contradict the \u201ceasy-to-use\u201d goal.\n\nIn short, the PM favoured cost-effective, high-impact features (scroll wheels, compact LCD) and vetoed speech/voice recognition as too expensive, risky and of marginal benefit.",
    "The group reaffirmed an \u201caudio-first\u201d policy.  For day-to-day meetings they will continue to record only sound and will do so under a tightened set of conventions:\n\n\u2022 Microphones \u2013  They agreed to standardise on one comfortable head-mounted, close-talking model.  Adam will take a \u201cfield trip\u201d to buy six-plus identical units; wired sets will be retired or converted to the same connector.  A second Sony wireless base-station will be ordered so every participant can use the uniform headset, bringing the ceiling to about nine wireless channels.  Correct placement (thumb-and-a-half from the corner of the mouth) was reviewed to minimise breath noise, and transcribers have already noticed the quality gain on the better channels.\n\n\u2022 Channel policy \u2013  All channels will be kept separate and time-aligned; no down-mixing or room array is planned because of cost, disk space and synchronisation problems.  If an outside team wants to experiment with an array, they can run a parallel system, but the core corpus will stay with the existing sixteen-channel board.\n\n\u2022 Transcription interface \u2013  Dave\u2019s modified Multi-Trans will let transcribers mark fine-grained overlaps; new filters will normalise numbers, acronyms and non-speech events so that channelised transcripts remain consistent with the audio.\n\nVideo was discussed but postponed.  Adding cameras would multiply human-subjects obligations, raise privacy objections, and require infrastructure no one on the current project is eager to build.  The team therefore will not pursue video unless an external partner (e.g., NIST, LDC or John Canny\u2019s group) supplies equipment, storage and personnel; in that case recordings could be made independently of the main audio system.  Until such a collaborator materialises, the corpus will remain strictly audio.",
    "The team revisited finances several times to ensure the remote could retail for the mandated \u20ac25 while still meeting the \u20ac50-million profit target. Early in the evaluation session the project manager warned of \u201ca couple of minor finance issues,\u201d joking that offshore manufacturing might be needed. Using the cost-sheet, they tallied every interface element: push-buttons, scroll wheel, LCD, voice-recognition chip, curved housing, coloured rubber and the locator beeper. When the first total crept above budget, expensive \u201cgimmicks\u201d were trimmed. The sample speaker and sophisticated scroll-wheel mechanism were replaced with simpler beeping hardware and two standard volume buttons. Because the locator only needed a small buzzer, it was retained. They also agreed that the rubber shell would count as a flat rather than curved surface, avoiding a surcharge, and left colour options \u201copen\u201d in case extra funds were required. With those adjustments the bill of materials fell comfortably below the limit, leaving \u201cabout one euro\u201d headroom. Several members noted that having the cost list earlier would have streamlined design decisions, and they recorded that feedback for management.\n\nThroughout the meetings the drawing board (large whiteboard) proved invaluable. The kick-off session was used to practise with it\u2014participants sketched animals to learn the pen tools. During design reviews they drew remote layouts, alternate slider panels, and button groupings in real time, something PowerPoint could not accommodate. The board let the group debate, erase and redraw quickly, boosting creativity and participation. At the wrap-up they agreed the combination of PowerPoint for prepared slides and the whiteboard for spontaneous revisions was highly effective and should be retained for future projects.",
    "Industrial Designer\u2019s view  \nCatherine constantly weighed aesthetics, ergonomics and feasibility. She wanted a \u201csleek, spongy\u201d remote that felt new and playful\u2014double-curved, rubber-cased, colour-coded buttons, kinetic self-power and, ideally, speech recognition. Yet whenever costs threatened the \u20ac12.50 production ceiling she was the first to propose concrete trade-offs: flatten the curve to one plane, swap rubber for injection-moulded plastic, concentrate colour on a single \u201cfruit-shaped\u201d key and collapse multiple keys into a scroll-wheel. Her recurring test was, \u201cDoes it still look young, feel good in the hand and show innovation?\u201d If the answer was no, she looked for another compromise.\n\nProject Manager\u2019s view  \nMarty\u2019s dominant thought was balance: \u201chit target cost, keep the Real Reaction look, and finish on time.\u201d Throughout the meetings he mentally totted up every suggestion against the bill-of-materials spreadsheet, repeating that any option pushing total above \u20ac12.50 had to be offset elsewhere. He also worried about brand identity\u2014yellow-and-blue accents, recognisable logo\u2014and about process discipline: five-minute presentations, action lists, e-mailed tasks. Where Catherine saw possibilities, Marty saw budget lines and risk; his mantra became, \u201cIf you add the sample speaker, you must drop something else.\u201d\n\nConclusions Marty drew after the team presentations  \n1. A workable specification exists: a single-curved plastic shell, kinetic energy source, voice-recognition \u201csample sensor/speaker,\u201d sixteen hard keys plus one coloured fruit-shaped rubber key.  \n2. This mix meets the \u20ac12.3 cost target, leaving a \u20ac0.2 buffer.  \n3. The design still scores \u201cfair\u201d on the team\u2019s fancy/innovation criteria\u2014style sacrificed slightly, but corporate image and technical novelty retained.  \n4. Final tasks are clear: finance sheet update, cosmetic mock-ups in brand colours, and a concise report of decisions for senior management.",
    "The group weighed the idea of a charging base several times.  At first they contrasted two paths: a compact handset powered by disposable batteries and located through a beeper, or a larger unit that would sit in a desktop cradle and recharge.  Industrial Design and Marketing warned that a dock would make the product \u201cclunky,\u201d raise costs and annoy users who expected something as pocketable as a phone.  Everyone informally voted for the small\u2010and-sleek option.  Later, however, once the prototype was modeled, the team chose to re-introduce a stand so the handset could recharge a lithium cell and house the voice-activated locator microphone.  They fixed the base\u2019s material and look\u2014gun-metal grey plastic\u2014to keep it neutral and allow coloured latex \u201cfashion sleeves\u201d on the remote itself.\n\nFashionability was evaluated formally on a seven-point scale alongside ease-of-use, feel and technology.  When they scored the clay mock-up most members gave its style only a \u201c2,\u201d admitting the model still looked more functional than trendy.  To boost appeal they brainstormed swap-able fruit-pattern sleeves, bright back-lighting, multi-coloured buttons and a high-gloss black or gun-metal body.  The agreed goal was a device that felt contemporary like an iPod yet could be refreshed annually with new covers to follow Milan-and-Paris colour trends.\n\nIn reviewing existing remotes they listed clear pros and cons.  Positives included kid-proof locking covers, tactile raised icons, side scroll wheels and the intuitive circular \u201cclick-wheel\u201d popularised by Apple.  Negatives were abundant: oversized \u201cgimmick\u201d units, LCD screens that drove cost and complexity, flimsy battery doors, confusing arrow orientation, and the general plague of \u201ctoo many tiny grey buttons.\u201d  Those observations steered them toward a pared-down layout with large labelled keys, side scrolls that have to be depressed to work, and optional voice-find rather than full speech command.",
    "The team reviewed eight related topics as follows:\n\nEnvironmental-friendly material   \nAn industrial-design study proposed using shape-memory alloys in the internal fasteners. When heated at end-of-life the screws would expand, letting the product fall apart so plastics, metals and electronics could be separated and recycled. A kinetic (self-charging) power cell was also favoured to eliminate disposable batteries.\n\nCurrent trend  \nMarketing\u2019s survey and fashion-watch reports show that \u201cfancy look & feel\u201d now outranks pure functionality. Milan/Paris spotters say the 2004\u201305 motif is fruit-and-vegetable imagery combined with a soft, \u201cspongy\u201d tactile finish.\n\nPotential materials  \nShort-listed skins were hard plastic, coloured plastics, latex/rubber, wood and titanium. Titanium gives a premium, \u201cspace-age\u201d image but cannot be double-curved and adds cost and weight. Consensus moved toward a hard internal shell (plastic or light metal) over-moulded with a thin latex layer for grip.\n\nLCD screen  \nUI designers like an LCD for menu navigation, preset storage and on-board graphics, but it needs an advanced chip and back-light, raising cost. An alternate plan is to keep a simple chip and have menus appear on the TV. No final decision was reached.\n\nColour  \nBright, primary \u201cfruit\u201d colours\u2014strawberry red, lemon yellow, lime green\u2014were judged most marketable. Swappable front covers were suggested so users can match d\u00e9cor or seasonal fashions while the corporate logo remains on the fixed rear housing.\n\nSpongy material  \nA bicycle-seat-type latex or stress-ball compound around the grip area would satisfy the trend and reduce RSI complaints.\n\nMaterial/function trade-offs  \nSwitching to push-buttons plus a simple chip saves \u20ac1\u20132 versus a scroll-wheel/LCD solution; speech recognition and special coatings were dropped to stay inside the \u20ac27 target cost.\n\nQuestionnaire insights  \n80 % of respondents will pay extra for an attractive remote; 90 % like voice recognition, but complexity worries older users. Large essential buttons, anti-lost locator and long-life power were rated \u201cmust have.\u201d",
    "The prototype was unveiled jointly by the Project Manager, the User-Interface (UI) designer and the Industrial Designer.  Two successive versions were shown.  The first, aimed at the \u20ac8 production bracket, keeps a conventional keypad but adopts a distinctive \u201csurf-board\u201d silhouette that makes it feel playful while still familiar in the hand.  The second, smoother version\u2014initially costed at \u20ac16\u2014 reduces the keypad to six multipurpose keys and adds an LCD screen, a toggle for switching device modes, a speech-recognition microphone, and a blinking LED that doubles as a low-battery indicator and visual locator.\n\nDuring discussion the team agreed that a single-function, television-only remote is preferable.  Multi-device capability (TV-DVD-VCR) would raise complexity, dilute the clean design, and push the manufacturing cost over the strict \u20ac12.50 cap imposed by management.  Concentrating on one function also makes the product easier to learn, keeps component count low, and leaves room in the budget for cosmetic or ergonomic upgrades such as coloured covers.\n\nWhen the prototype was scored, the \u201ctechnology/innovation\u201d criterion received the weakest marks.  Reasons were: (1) the basic model offers nothing new beyond its shape; (2) cost pressure forced deletion of the LCD and speech-recognition options from the advanced model; (3) only a simple scroll-wheel and standard infrared remained, so the design was judged marginally innovative at best.\n\nLost-remote complaints surfaced repeatedly in user research, so a locator was folded into the functional requirements.  Several alternatives were explored: a blinking LED, glow-in-the-dark casing, illuminated keys that light for a few seconds when touched, and an optional stick-on beeper tag triggered from the TV.  Final feasibility and power-consumption figures were assigned to the engineering team for follow-up.",
    "PhD A and PhD C finally converged on three points.\n\nFirst, on variance and normalisation.  Both felt that \u201ctable-style\u201d summaries of means, variances and standard-deviations were not helping: after log compression the numbers looked almost identical whether one or two speakers were present.  They agreed to stop dividing the log-energy by its global variance and instead try several simpler baselines: raw frame energy, log-energy without z-norm, and z-norm computed over shorter, sliding windows.  The idea is to look at the resulting histograms first; only if a clear separation appears would they revisit more elaborate variance schemes.\n\nSecond, in a side discussion with Jos\u00e9 they sketched the immediate next steps.  Jos\u00e9 will (a) sweep the analysis-window length beyond the current fixed 200 ms, (b) experiment with moving windows, and (c) plot straight distributions\u2014single-feature first, then two-dimensional scatter plots if necessary.  Once the energy picture is understood, he will prototype pitch and harmonicity cues, which all three believe are more likely to survive log compression.\n\nThird, they reviewed the practical obstacles created by overlaps.  Energy often rises when two people speak, but back-channels, soft interjections or equipment gain changes can cancel that rise, producing heavy distribution overlap.  Overlaps also vary in duration; normalising a 200 ms back-channel with a 5-s window hides the effect completely, while very small windows are too noisy.  Because of these issues they accepted Liz\u2019s suggestion to label different overlap TYPES (short back-channels, full-turn interruptions, etc.) and to test features on each subset separately.  Without such stratification, neither variance-based nor energy-based detectors are likely to work reliably.\n\nIn short: scrap global variance normalisation, let Jos\u00e9 run a focused set of energy studies, and tackle overlaps by type to minimise confounding.",
    "Latency came up while PhD-D described the new smoothing step that follows spectral-subtraction/Wiener filtering.  \nThe smoothing is implemented as a recursive, \u201ccentered\u201d average of the gain curve: instead of using only past frames, the algorithm also waits for a number of future frames before it decides how much to attenuate the current one.  That look-ahead produces extra delay\u2014PhD-D confirmed the recursion uses about \u201cfive-zero\u201d frames.  With the usual 10 ms frame rate, that is roughly 50 \u00d7 10 ms \u2248 0.5 s of additional latency.\n\nProfessor C objected for two reasons.\n\n1. Interaction requirements: the SmartKom dialog system is supposed to behave in real time.  If every front-end module adds its own delay, overall response time may become unacceptable.  \n2. Design flexibility: if the team ignores latency now and later discovers strict limits (e.g., the standard or a customer demands snappier response), they might have to redesign the algorithm under time pressure.\n\nHe therefore pressed PhD-D to quantify the delay, asked whether the mean could be estimated from past frames only, and wanted to know the performance cost of removing the look-ahead.  PhD-D replied that a past-only version is \u201caround three-percent relative\u201d worse in word-error-rate, but the professor still urged caution, warning they might \u201chave to cut the latency in half\u201d later.\n\nIn short, the added latency is about 50 frames, or roughly 500 milliseconds, and the professor\u2019s concern is that this half-second delay, though helpful for accuracy, could compromise the responsiveness expected from an interactive speech system.",
    "The User-Interface designer\u2019s detailed prototype adds a series of concrete features, each tied to an explicit user benefit.\n\n\u2022 Ergonomic, sculpted case \u2013 The remote\u2019s curved \u201cfits-the-hand\u201d silhouette reduces strain and lets users grip it naturally from any angle.  \n\u2022 Wooden housing with stainable finish \u2013 Solid wood gives a warm, furniture-like feel and allows buyers to pick any stain, so the unit can blend with living-room d\u00e9cor or become a personal style statement.  \n\u2022 Optional custom back-plate / front flap \u2013 Both sides can be laser-etched or swapped, supporting individual branding or gifts without altering electronics.  \n\u2022 Flip-up panel with integrated yellow LCD \u2013 The screen supplies contextual feedback (menus, channel names, set-up prompts). Because it is mounted on a flap, it can be omitted for a low-cost model, letting the same tooling serve two price points.  \n\u2022 Oversized yellow on/off key \u2013 A high-contrast, central, tactile power button is \u201cimpossible to miss,\u201d easing use for seniors and children.  \n\u2022 Colour-coded control zones \u2013 Dark-blue numeric pad, orange volume keys, and distinct menu/voice toggles let users navigate by sight or muscle memory, cutting search time.  \n\u2022 Always-available voice recognition plus kill-switch \u2013 A side-mounted microphone keeps voice control active even when the flap is shut; a dedicated \u201cvoice off\u201d key protects privacy.  \n\u2022 Sufficient mass without bulk \u2013 Deliberately weighted internals give a sense of quality and prevent accidental drops while still meeting overall size targets.  \n\u2022 Raised, egg-shaped soft-touch buttons \u2013 Differing textures signal function and remain operable with one thumb, supporting one-handed use for both left- and right-handed users.  \n\nTaken together, these elements deliver a remote that is comfortable, customisable, visually striking, simple to operate by touch, and adaptable to multiple cost tiers\u2014advantages the team judged crucial for market acceptance.",
    "The design team showed one physical mock-up that can be built in two alternative \u201cpackages.\u201d  \nAppearance \u2013 Both share the same slim, slightly curved titanium housing. On the front sits one large 5-way joystick that \u201ctilts and clicks\u201d for all navigation and \u201center\u201d actions; there are no extra keys.  A small microphone is drilled into the left side and a sliding switch underneath lets users activate or mute speech input.  Power comes from a single AA rechargeable; the unit is parked nose-down in a matching desktop charger.  The case is tough enough for children yet light in the hand.\n\nVersion A: LCD / speech model  \n\u2022 A thumb-sized colour LCD is recessed at the top.  \n\u2022 Speech recognition is enabled; spoken keywords can call the set, locate the remote or trigger parental modules.  \n\u2022 Two snap-on \u201ccartridges\u201d (large-print senior pad and kids-only pad) can be clipped to the rear connector.  \n\u2022 Estimated build cost \u2248 15 USD \u2013 above the \u20ac12.5 target.  \n\nVersion B: Basic model  \n\u2022 The LCD is omitted and the joystick cap is enlarged to show simple pictograms; speech, cartridges and the mic can still be fitted later.  \n\u2022 Fewer parts cut production to roughly 10\u201311 USD and free exterior space for brighter, \u201cfruit-coloured\u201d skins that Marketing wants.  \n\nDiscussion focused on microphone position, joystick durability, the danger of parents losing separate cartridges, and whether modularity really lowers cost.  Marketing stressed fashion and price, the PM stressed robustness and a single bill-of-materials.\n\nConclusion \u2013 The group chose Version B as the reference prototype: it meets the \u20ac12.5 ceiling, lets the shell be re-styled (e.g., spongy fruit colours) and still accepts the speech and parental modules if later demanded.  Design and UI will now refine the outer styling while Engineering prepares a working basic sample.",
    "The team weighed four hardware questions against the tight \u20ac12.50-per-unit cost target and the goal of keeping the remote simple, robust and \u201cfashion-forward.\u201d\n\nTouch screen  \n\u2022 Seen as the surest \u201cwow\u201d feature, but the component quote came in at roughly \u20ac17.50 per unit, immediately pushing retail above \u20ac25.  \n\u2022 It would also force higher-capacity batteries and new suppliers.  \n\u2022 Consensus: park the touch screen for a later model; concentrate resources on voice recognition and styling for this release.\n\nFlip screen / flip-top concepts  \n\u2022 A flip-phone-style lid was popular because it hides seldom-used keys, prevents accidental presses and lets the body stay compact.  \n\u2022 In Meeting 2 it was tied to an electronic panel for programming; later it became a simple fold-out or side-slide that reveals secondary buttons when voice control is not wanted.  \n\u2022 Weight and durability were flagged (especially with wood or rubber skins), but the mechanism itself is inexpensive, so the idea stays in scope.\n\nBattery and power  \n\u2022 AAA cells were judged bulky; lithium rechargeables would mean switching manufacturers.  \n\u2022 Two lower-cost, \u201cgreen\u201d options surfaced: solar cells with a small back-up coin cell, or kinetic charging. Solar won provisional approval\u2014cheap, matches the eco message and can drive voice recognition\u2014provided a reserve battery is included for low-light rooms.  \n\u2022 A front LED \u201cfuel-gauge\u201d will warn users as power drops.\n\nOverall functional package  \n\u2022 Keep always-visible buttons to the basics (power, channel/volume rocker, menu).  \n\u2022 House advanced functions under the flip lid and in the voice interface.  \n\u2022 Use rugged rubber buttons on a curved, rubber-clad (or optional wood-skin) case; add a locator beep activated from the TV.  \n\nThis approach meets the budget, keeps usability high, and leaves headline features for future upgrades.",
    "Schools Challenge Cymru (SCC) was designed as an intense, three-year, time-limited intervention for 39 of the most challenged secondary schools.  Reflecting on that investment, the Cabinet Secretary highlighted six interconnected lessons that are now being built into mainstream school-improvement policy:\n\n1. Leadership is pivotal.  Schools that moved fastest had newly-appointed, high-calibre head-teachers; leadership development is therefore a central strand of the national mission and of regional consortia work.\n\n2. Robust systems and processes matter.  Successful SCC schools had clear pupil-tracking, data and assessment mechanisms.  Those approaches are now expected of every school and are scrutinised by regional challenge advisers.\n\n3. Teacher quality drives outcomes.  Consortia are focusing on classroom pedagogy, professional learning and the new national professional standards first piloted in SCC.\n\n4. Collaboration accelerates improvement.  The self-improving school system, cluster work and peer-to-peer support mirror the collaborative culture fostered in SCC.\n\n5. Targeted, intensive support is effective.  Under the revised categorisation model, a \u201cred\u201d school is now entitled to 25 days of external support\u2014more than the 20 days SCC provided\u2014and Improvement Boards established under SCC have been retained.\n\n6. High-quality advisers are indispensable.  Many of SCC\u2019s best advisers have been employed permanently by the four regional consortia so that their expertise benefits all schools, not just the original 39.\n\nProgress since the programme\u2019s formal close has been encouraging.  Examples cited include Tredegar Comprehensive, now categorised \u201cgreen\u201d, and Eastern High, which has exited special measures.  Where SCC impact was limited, consortia are using the same lessons\u2014particularly leadership intervention and tighter data use\u2014to provide bespoke support.  In short, SCC has ended as a stand-alone scheme, but its successful elements have been embedded across Wales through the regional consortia and the wider \u201cnational mission,\u201d ensuring the original investment continues to yield system-wide benefits.",
    "Dr David Blaney told the Committee that Brexit\u2019s chief effect on Welsh higher education is growing uncertainty rather than an immediate financial shock.  That uncertainty is already visible in recruitment: 2018 UCAS figures show an 8 % fall in EU-domiciled applications to Welsh universities (and a similar 9 % fall from non-EU markets) while English institutions recorded modest growth.  Blaney cautioned that it is hard to attribute precise causes, but highlighted two main Brexit-related factors.\n\nFirst, the Welsh Government\u2019s decision\u2014taken in parallel with the Brexit process\u2014to withdraw the tuition\u2010fee grant for EU students means applicants now have to borrow the full fee, removing a price advantage Wales once enjoyed.  Blaney expects this \u201cperturbation\u201d to be temporary but acknowledges it has depressed demand this cycle.  \n\nSecond, in a highly competitive global market, appearance and investment matter.  Years of tighter capital funding in Wales, compounded by uncertainty over future EU structural and research money, have limited universities\u2019 ability to refresh campuses and equipment.  English institutions, able to invest more heavily, therefore look more attractive to some European applicants.  Media coverage centred on England further magnifies that gap.\n\nDespite these pressures, Blaney believes Wales remains a compelling destination.  Prospective students receive exactly the same UK-degree quality but in a setting he describes as \u201csafer, more comfortable and more supportive\u201d than many larger English cities.  Lower average tuition fees, smaller campus communities, and the sector\u2019s collective \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d branding campaign reinforce that message.  In short, while Brexit poses real recruitment and research risks, Blaney argues Wales can still compete by emphasising safety, community and value.",
    "Within the semantic specification we sketched, each utterance is interpreted against three mental-space domains.\n\n1. Scenario Domain \u00ad\u2013 the \u201cworld\u201d that the clause is about.  It is populated with the image/X-schemata that describe spatial layout, force\u2013dynamics, causal links, temporal ordering, etc.  Typical slots are PATH, SOURCE, GOAL, CONTAINER, CAUSE, RESULT, POLARITY and ASPECT.  Binding these schemas to one another yields the event structure that will later be simulated.\n\n2. Referent Domain \u00ad\u2013 the set of discourse entities that the current utterance can point to.  For every active referent we store linguistically relevant properties (number, gender, animacy, collectivity, discourse status, etc.) plus any local predications that help identify it (e.g. \u201cthe guy I know from school\u201d).  A referent entry can simply index an existing object in the broader discourse context, so the space does not have to be rebuilt each turn.\n\n3. Discourse-Segment Domain \u00ad\u2013 information-structure and speech-act facts tied to this utterance: speaker, addressee, time, place, attitude, focus/topic, polarity, evidentiality, intonation cues, and the base mental-space currently in force.  It is here that deictic items such as I, you, here, now, past, conditional, etc. are resolved before further interpretation.\n\nFunction of the middle layer  \nBetween low-level form cues (verbs, \u201cadmission fee\u201d mention, prosody, time-of-day, context switch\u2026) and the ultimate behavioural choice (ENTER, TANGO, VISTA) we insert a hidden probabilistic layer.  Nodes such as ON-TOUR, DOING-BUSINESS, FINAL-DESTINATION, IN-A-HURRY represent abstract situational hypotheses.  They are not directly observed in the dialogue but are easier to learn and greatly reduce the parameter space: observable cues feed into the middle layer; the middle layer jointly determines the mode.  During inference the system updates these hidden variables, allowing many surface patterns to map to a small set of coherent plans, and letting new cues affect the interpretation without rewriting the entire conditional-probability table.",
    "On the back-end, the professor felt the current recogniser \u201cis too simple\u201d and is now the main bottleneck.  He pointed out that the front-end (the tandem features) already performs well, so \u201cthere\u2019s something simple that\u2019s wrong with the back-end.\u201d  He urged the team to experiment with a richer acoustic model\u2014e.g. try many more Gaussians, re-train the HMMs with the large SRI training set, and run the tandem features through the full SRI decoder that includes on-line, unsupervised adaptation.  In his view, once the back-end is strengthened the digit error rate gap between their system and SRI\u2019s should narrow dramatically; retraining the front-end is far less important than fixing the back-end.\n\nOn storing data, the same professor\u2019s position was \u201csave everything as long as we have disk space.\u201d  He insisted that all far-field channels from the SmartKom sessions and any other non-meeting material be archived because future acoustic work may need them.  Organizationally, he was happy to keep the same scripts and directory structure to minimise extra work, but the files should live in clearly labelled sub-trees so no one confuses them with the core Meeting Recorder corpus.  As for capacity, he noted that \u201cdisk is essentially close to free,\u201d recommended buying another file server, and proposed parking raw recordings on non-backed-up disks while making a single tape or NW-archive copy for safety.  That way they avoid nightly backup overload yet still have a permanent archive.",
    "Committee members pressed the government on five fronts.\n\n1. Seniors-care crisis:  All parties condemned the \u201chorrific\u201d conditions described by the Canadian Armed Forces in several long-term-care (LTC) homes.  The Prime Minister stressed health care is provincial jurisdiction but said Ottawa \u201cwill be there\u201d with funding, military help and future standards.  NDP Leader Singh demanded federal leadership, national LTC norms and an end to for-profit facilities, while Health Minister Hajdu and Deputy PM Freeland agreed systemic reform is essential and promised to work with premiers on minimum, enforceable benchmarks.\n\n2. Racism and LTC policy:  Singh and other MPs linked the disproportionate COVID-19 death toll among racialized seniors to wider systemic racism.  They urged race-based data collection to shape policy; cabinet said Statistics Canada has been tasked with gathering such data and pledged that any national LTC standards must confront inequities faced by Black and Indigenous elders.\n\n3. Protection of workers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 rights:  NDP members warned of looming bankruptcies and asked the Liberals to rank severance, termination pay and pensions ahead of other creditors.  Labour and Industry ministers replied that 2019 amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the CCAA already enhance transparency, curb executive bonuses and give courts new powers, but they are \u201cmonitoring gaps\u201d and open to further changes.\n\n4. Veterans\u2019 issues:  Veterans Affairs Minister Lawrence MacAulay welcomed \u201canyone\u201d joining the public debate on veterans\u2019 programs.  He cited an extra $90 million to tackle the disability-benefit backlog, said all compensation regimes are under review, and denied that files are \u201cred-flagged\u201d to silence critics.\n\n5. Pandemic assistance for seniors:  Seniors Minister Deb Schulte outlined a one-time, tax-free payment\u2014$300 to all OAS recipients plus $200 for those on GIS\u2014backed by earlier GST credits and $9-million for community supports.  She called it immediate relief to offset higher food, delivery and dispensing fees, and noted total 2020 aid to seniors now doubles the amount promised in the Liberal platform.",
    "The three team members clashed because each judged every design idea through the lens of his or her own professional mandate.\n\n\u2022 Project Manager \u2013 had to keep the unit below \u20ac12.50 manufacturing cost, launch quickly, and present a recognisable Real Reaction product. He therefore pushed for the simplest, safest options: a TV-only remote, infrared transmission, few buttons, no teletext, no voice control, and colours that matched the corporate palette. Anything that threatened cost, schedule or brand consistency triggered resistance.\n\n\u2022 Marketing \u2013 cared first about \u201cwant-to-have\u201d appeal. Andrew argued for eye-catching \u201cfruit\u201d colours, interchangeable covers, back-lights, voice recognition and especially parental-control log-ins he could advertise with the slogan \u201ctake parental control to a new dimension.\u201d He accepted higher complexity or cost if it helped differentiation and gave him more stories for the campaign.\n\n\u2022 Industrial Designer \u2013 was responsible for making the object buildable, ergonomic and robust. Baba favoured rubberised double-curved shapes, kinetic re-charging, and a protected touch screen, but worried about added electronics, reliability and the engineering hours hidden behind Marketing\u2019s wish-list. He even questioned whether infrared should be replaced by a cheaper wired link, something Marketing considered un-sellable and the PM feared consumers would reject.\n\nBecause every feature\u2014parental control, body shape, colour scheme, number of front buttons, choice of wireless technology, chipset, or case material\u2014directly affected cost, schedule, manufacturability and perceived coolness, each discipline\u2019s priorities pulled in a different direction. Without an agreed hierarchy (cost vs. looks vs. feasibility) the conversation repeatedly stalled, producing the disagreements recorded in the meetings.",
    "Marketing set up a deliberately simple, numeric scoring exercise so the group could judge every design alternative in exactly the same way and then choose the one with the highest average.  \n\u2022 First they drew up a \u201cshort-list of criteria\u201d, i.e. the qualities they believe actually persuade customers to buy the remote.  \n\u2022 During the meeting they asked the whole team to talk through each criterion, score the candidate designs and then take the mean of the individual scores to obtain one overall figure for each concept.\n\nThe criteria they insisted on were:\n\n1. Look & Feel \u2013 overall visual appeal and tactile impression of the product.  \n2. Innovation \u2013 the extent to which the remote offers functions or styling that are new to the market.  \n3. Ease of Use \u2013 how quickly an average user can understand and operate it.  \n4. Appeal to the Target Demographic \u2013 whether the design resonates with the chosen 20- to 40-year-old audience.  \n5. Compliance with the Company Motto / Fashion Trend \u2013 how well the design reflects the firm\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d positioning by, for example, allowing colour-covers or fruit-and-vegetable themes.\n\nLater, when they repeated the exercise for the finished prototype, Marketing used the same method but translated the list into a 1\u20137 scale (\u201c1 = true, 7 = false\u201d) and embedded a few sub-items taken from earlier user research\u2014e.g. \u201cIs it ugly?\u201d, \u201cWill it be easy to find when lost?\u201d, \u201cDoes it reduce RSI?\u201d.  However, the backbone of the evaluation remained the five headline criteria above, and the decision rule stayed the same: total the scores and pick the concept with the lowest (i.e. best) average.",
    "Recordings\n\u2022 We now have roughly thirty-five hours of meeting audio on disk (about thirty hours of conversational material and five hours of spoken-digit sessions).  \n\u2022 Capture quality is stable: six Sony UHF wireless head-sets plus three wired mics are in service; two remaining wired channels will be replaced by an additional Sony base-station so that every seat can be wireless.  \n\u2022 New, lighter head-sets with pre-wired Sony connectors arrive tomorrow; once comfort is confirmed we will order enough to replace all remaining wired units.  \n\u2022 UW and SRI are adopting the same Sony front end, so future data will be directly compatible.\n\nTranscription\n\u2022 Eleven hours of speech are completely transcribed.  Two senior transcribers are still working, so the finished total should pass twelve hours this week.  \n\u2022 Current effort is on \u201cclean\u2013up\u201d: spell-checking, consistent mark-up, and automatic insertion of tags for numbers, acronyms and non-speech events.  Cleaned files are then \u201cchannelised\u201d (speaker-separated).  \n\u2022 Thilo\u2019s new multi-channel speech/non-speech segmenter is running; once boundaries are tightened the cleaned transcripts will be re-aligned automatically.  \n\u2022 A web-based approval tool already generates a page per meeting; participants will receive a password only if they want to review the text.

    "The Deputy Minister dealt with the three subject-areas in separate amendment groups and adopted a consistent approach: she put essential duties on the face of the Bill, resisted extra prescription, but offered limited concessions where Members asked for additional reassurance.\n\nDuty to promote public awareness (Group 1)  \n\u2022 She tabled Government amendments 1 and 4, inserting a clear, statutory duty on Welsh Ministers to \u201cprovide information and increase awareness\u201d of the law change.  \n\u2022 She confirmed a six-year, high-intensity campaign, run through an expert stakeholder group, would start on Royal Assent.  \n\u2022 Amendments 1A-1E (naming specific audiences, topics and an indefinite campaign) were opposed as \u201cunnecessary and over-prescriptive\u201d. She said children\u2019s rights and safeguarding duties already cover the points raised, and listing particular groups such as \u201cvisitors to Wales\u201d could skew effort. Members therefore supported her two amendments and rejected the others.\n\nDuty to report on the effect of the legislation (Group 2)  \n\u2022 Government amendments 2 and 5 created a statutory post-implementation review: ongoing data collection plus a formal report laid before the Assembly five years after commencement.  \n\u2022 She outlined continuing attitude surveys and a task-and-finish group to monitor service impacts.  \n\u2022 She rejected opposition amendments seeking an earlier or more detailed report, or a pre-commencement evaluation of the awareness campaign, arguing they duplicated work or would let non-devolved bodies delay the Act.  \n\u2022 However, she agreed in debate to explore an additional interim (three-year) report and to consult the Committee on its scope before Stage 3.\n\nRegulation-making powers (Group 3)  \n\u2022 Because her later amendment fixes commencement automatically after two years, amendments 3 and 6 simply reinstate a narrow power to make \u201ctransitory, transitional or saving\u201d provision by statutory instrument with no procedure, reflecting Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee advice.  \n\u2022 She resisted Suzy Davies\u2019s amendment 3A, which sought broader regulation-making and an Assembly procedure, saying wider powers were unnecessary but promising to review the point and discuss options with Members before Stage 3.\n\nIn sum, the Deputy Minister anchored core duties in the Bill, resisted detailed prescription, but left the door open to a negotiated interim review and any technical regulatory tweaks if genuinely needed.",
    "Witnesses agreed that judging Wales\u2019s long-term progress is harder than before because headline indicators have been repeatedly redesigned to stop schools \u201cteaching to the test\u201d.  Kirsty Williams said past level-2-plus and capped-points measures drove narrow behaviour, so Welsh Government now tracks a broader basket: \n\u2022 movement of schools through the colour-categorisation system, \n\u2022 Estyn inspection patterns, \n\u2022 examination outcomes disaggregated by groups (FSM, ALN, minority ethnic), \n\u2022 wider wellbeing and curriculum data that are still being built.   \nPrimary trends are positive (more greens); secondary performance is stubborn, especially the small cohort of red/amber schools that \u201cdo not move at pace\u201d, so a multi-agency intervention model has begun.\n\nPhilip Blaker outlined Qualification Wales\u2019s part in raising standards.  The regulator does not run improvement programmes in schools; it secures the quality and fairness of qualifications by: \n\u2022 setting approval criteria, scrutinising WJEC specifications and sample papers, \n\u2022 prescribing awarding approaches such as \u201ccomparable outcomes\u201d so that grades remain stable even when teaching quality or resources differ, \n\u2022 monitoring WJEC\u2019s annual grading and, during reforms, insisting on timelines that give the system \u201c18-24 months\u201d between approval and first teaching.  \nIt is also co-ordinating future reform planning so that curriculum, assessment and supporting resources are aligned and delivered safely.\n\nOn the loss of summer 2020 exams, Blaker advised an early, unequivocal cancellation.  WJEC and schools already hold externally-moderated unit marks and coursework; together with teacher evidence these will generate grades.  The intention is to keep results-days on the normal mid-August timetable, though this depends on staff health and moderation across UK regulators.  Detailed instructions to centres were promised \u201cwithin days\u201d, and final grades will carry the same currency for progression to sixth-form, college, apprenticeships or university.",
    "Witnesses acknowledged that examples of high-quality early-years and childcare practice already exist, but said Wales still lacks the mechanisms to transfer that practice system-wide.  Four main obstacles were identified.\n\n1. Fragmented system.  Responsibility for health visiting, parenting support, Flying Start, Foundation Phase, the 30-hour childcare offer and local employment schemes sits with different agencies.  Because data, budgets and objectives are not routinely shared, local pathfinder projects have to spend time just mapping who does what before they can redesign services.  Until a clearer, all-Wales framework is agreed, good local models remain pockets of excellence.\n\n2. Uneven local capacity.  Urban authorities usually have formal childcare settings that can adopt new approaches quickly, but rural and Valley authorities rely more on family or sessional care.  Welsh-medium and SEN places are particularly scarce outside traditional heartlands.  Without staff, buildings and transport, authorities cannot replicate practice they admire elsewhere, even when capital money is available.\n\n3. Workforce shortages.  Quality initiatives\u2014play-based pedagogy, bilingual immersion, attachment-informed approaches\u2014demand qualified practitioners.  Low wages and high turnover mean many settings struggle to release staff for training, so the same names appear on every pilot while others fall further behind.\n\n4. Administrative complexity.  Different eligibility rules for Flying Start, the Childcare Offer, tax-free childcare and school transport confuse parents and deter providers.  Local authorities report that much of the \u201cgood practice\u201d they are asked to spread depends on bespoke paperwork or flexible funding streams that do not exist everywhere else.\n\nImplications: unless Welsh Government simplifies governance, funds targeted workforce programmes and matches revenue support to capital expansion, the new 30-hour offer risks widening, not closing, gaps in access and quality.  A national, bilingual training plan and a single, HMRC-based application system were highlighted as urgent prerequisites for turning isolated good practice into a truly universal, high-quality childcare service.",
    "The team reviewed which components can be sourced immediately and agreed on a workable set that balances novelty with supply-chain reality.  \n\nElectronics  \n\u2022 Control chip \u2013 The TA11835, the industry-standard IR encoder used in most TVs, is in stock and will be adopted.  \n\u2022 Power \u2013 No suitable rechargeable pack is available. AA/AAA cells were judged bulky; dynamo winding was rejected as gimmicky; solar cells are fragile and costly. The group therefore chose a kinetic generator feeding a small watch-type cell, which the factory can supply. A standby mode will cut current draw and extend charge life.  \n\nInterface hardware  \n\u2022 PCB \u2013 A conventional silicone-domed PCB keypad is easy to resize, so switch spacing can match whichever layout is finalised.  \n\u2022 Upper (flip) panel \u2013 A monochrome LCD touch area will host icon-based \u201cGUI\u201d controls. LCD glass is thin, widely available, and can be wired conveniently inside the hinge.  \n\u2022 Lower panel \u2013 High-use keys (volume, channel) will remain physical. Buttons will be moulded from the \u201cstress-ball\u201d rubber that the supplier already stocks; it promises a soft, anti-RSI feel.\n\nCase materials  \n\u2022 Plastic was confirmed for the structural shell because the factory can mould complex curves and keep tooling cheap.  \n\u2022 Wood is impractical and expensive; titanium allows only simple box shapes and would drive cost up.  \n\u2022 A removable rubber sleeve will slide over the plastic chassis to deliver the spongy texture consumers want and to enable quick colour changes. Sleeves can be produced inexpensively in fruit- and vegetable-inspired colours, letting the design stay on trend with minimal re-tooling.\n\nOpen item  \nVoice-recognition \u201cfind-me\u201d circuitry exists in-house, but its cost must be checked before inclusion.",
    "The professor was satisfied that the team has converged on a single \u201cfinal\u201d noise\u2013reduction front-end: a configurable package that can run either Wiener filtering or spectral-subtraction on FFT bins, with time- and frequency-smoothing and modest noise over-estimation.  Although its 53.7 % score is only a point worse than the previous best, he views the real achievement as having one common code base.  He urged the group to freeze that configuration for a while, stop \u201cfutzing\u201d with knobs, and concentrate instead on three add-ons: better stationary-noise estimation, a lower-latency VAD, and a follow-on neural\u2013net enhancement stage.  Latency can be relaxed unless the standards body imposes a hard limit; accuracy should drive design for now.\n\nOn modelling the time series, he reacted positively to the idea of using factorial HMMs: several parallel, independently-evolving feature streams that are coupled only at decision time.  Their parameter economy and straightforward Viterbi decoding make them a plausible match for the forthcoming learned feature detectors.\n\nFor reverberation he endorsed the plan to replicate Avenda\u00f1o\u2019s modulation-spectrum approach.  By analysing two-second windows (so most of the room impulse falls inside the frame), subtracting the DC component, and then trading spectral for temporal resolution when the representation is \u201ccollapsed\u201d back to 10 ms frames, the channel can be treated almost like a fixed convolution.  He encouraged estimating how quickly the room response actually changes\u2014using the echo-canceller taps between near- and table-mics\u2014to see whether a time-varying extension is necessary.\n\nFinally, in the digit-prompt protocol he reminded everyone that the digit \u20180\u2019 must carry both pronunciations, /ow/ (\u201cO\u201d) and /zi\u0279o\u028a/ (\u201czero\u201d).  Forms will continue to display the numeral, letting speakers say whichever form feels natural.",
    "The team confirmed the overall concept for launching the new remote as a moderately-priced, style-oriented universal controller that can operate at least three devices (TV, VCR/DVD, set-top box) while staying below the \u20ac12.50 cost target. On the physical concept they settled on a double-curved, rubber-sheathed housing with hard plastic inside: it should feel \u201cspongy\u201d but still protect the electronics, allow bright fruit-coloured, interchangeable covers and survive drops. Main energy will come from a rechargeable kinetic generator, supplemented by a small back-up battery; solar was rejected as bulky and unreliable.\n\nFor the interface they ruled out an LCD and full scroll wheel to save money, opting for large, back-lit push-buttons for the core tasks (power, volume, channel up/down and five preset-channel keys) plus a single \u201cmenu\u201d key that calls an on-screen list of advanced functions. This keeps the handset visually clean yet still configurable.\n\nUniversal features prompted an \u201cessential-only\u201d philosophy: parental control is in, games are out. The agreed parental system will be profile-based and resident in every unit. At first use it behaves like a normal remote; parents can later activate profiles, pick forbidden channels or time slots and set a quick three-digit PIN. A separate lock-box or external add-on was rejected.\n\nVoice recognition drew mixed views. Marketing likes its trend value and engineering says a limited vocabulary (\u201con, off, 1-20\u201d) is feasible, so the group kept it on the spec as an optional, low-cost enhancement\u2014useful when the remote is misplaced\u2014but emphasised it must not be the primary control mode and must not push the price above target. Casual games were considered unnecessary clutter and dropped.",
    "Committee members pressed the Welsh Government on two linked mental-health issues: a possible rise in suicides among children and young people during the pandemic, and the continuity of perinatal mental-health care.\n\nOn suicide, Vaughan Gething confirmed that Ministers share the committee\u2019s anxiety but lack firm data while normal face-to-face services are restricted. To establish whether COVID-19 restrictions are triggering more self-inflicted deaths, the Government has commissioned the Delivery Unit, working with the National Advisory Group on Suicide and Self-harm (Dr Ann John and colleagues), to examine every \u201cunexpected death\u201d of under-18s recorded since the outbreak began. A preliminary report is due before month-end; the Minister pledged to forward its findings to the committee. Meanwhile, child and adolescent crisis-response teams remain classified as \u201cessential services\u201d: 24/7 crisis lines, CAMHS liaison and in-patient beds have been protected and are currently meeting demand. Weekly monitoring tools track staff sickness, referral levels and bed occupancy so capacity can be redeployed quickly if a spike is detected.\n\nTurning to pregnant and post-partum women, Gething stressed that perinatal mental-health support has continued, albeit with major adaptations. Community teams are using telephone and video consultations; health boards were instructed not to redeploy core staff away from perinatal services. Work on Wales\u2019s first Mother and Baby Unit has inevitably slowed, but the Minister reiterated that the project is still funded and will resume as soon as construction and clinical planning can safely restart. Officials are also analysing reports of fewer women accepting in-patient placements during lockdown, viewing this as fear-related rather than evidence of reduced need, and will incorporate those findings into long-term service planning.",
    "\u2022 Implementation timetable  \nThe National Evaluation and Improvement Resource (NEIR) is now in its final test phase and will be rolled out \u201cacross the system at the start of the new academic year, in September 2020.\u201d  Kirsty Williams confirmed that the reform programme is still running \u201cthere or thereabouts\u201d to the dates set out in \u2018Our National Mission\u2019.  No separate end-date was set for Professor Dylan Jones\u2019s Strategic Delivery Group; its work will continue alongside curriculum roll-out, but the operational tools schools need will be in place by September.\n\n\u2022 Risk of losing focus  \nAsked whether the Strategic Delivery Group risked drifting as its brief widens, the Minister was emphatic: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d  She said the group is \u201cvery, very clear\u201d about roles, avoids duplication and is concentrating on supporting curriculum implementation, so loss of focus is not seen as a threat.\n\n\u2022 Tackling the harder improvements  \nMembers queried whether switching to new interim performance measures, broader self-evaluation and tackling long-standing attainment gaps makes improvement \u201cmore of a challenge\u201d.  Ministers agreed it is harder, but said it is essential: relying on old, narrow indicators produced \u201clow-hanging-fruit\u201d gains and unhelpful behaviours.  The new approach forces schools to address fundamentals\u2014leadership, teaching quality, well-being and progression for every learner, especially the most able and those in poverty\u2014so the Government is \u201ccommitted to the harder route\u201d.\n\n\u2022 PRU networking and transition  \nLocal authority witnesses reported \u201cmuch stronger networking within the PRU sector\u201d\u2014staff now share practice, make joint visits and use each other\u2019s expertise on curriculum and behaviour.  Swansea highlighted a new, purpose-built PRU opening in January 2021 and a devolved-budget model that keeps schools involved.  On transition, both Swansea and Torfaen described phased, part-time reintegration plans: PRU staff work closely with the home school, support continues after return, and multi-agency teams tackle transport, family and well-being issues.  Reintegration is easiest in Key Stages 2\u20133; at Key Stage 4 the focus shifts to sustaining engagement and linking with FE or training.",
    "On infra-red functionality the team felt there was no need to abandon the traditional link. The Industrial Designer reviewed alternative transmission methods and concluded that \u201cin my opinion infra-red is the best way\u201d because it already works reliably, is inexpensive and, in his view, does not demand a strict sight-line. The working-design diagram therefore kept the classic battery-to-chip-to-IR-LED chain. All members agreed that the signal must be \u201creliable and clear\u201d so users are not \u201cwaving the remote around,\u201d and that this hinges on good-quality components plus a battery that can deliver enough power. The Project Manager later added that achieving \u201cvery functional infra-red\u201d supports their overall simplicity-and-ease-of-use objective.\n\nWhen disposable income was discussed, Marketing cited survey data showing that 91 % of 15- to 25-year-olds would pay more for advanced features and argued that this group \u201chas a higher disposable income\u201d because it is free of mortgages, cars and other long-term commitments. The Project Manager agreed, noting the planned \u20ac25 selling price \u201cis not unaffordable, even for young people,\u201d while the Industrial Designer observed that 25- to 35-year-olds also possess spending power once they begin full-time work. After a brief debate about whether students actually own televisions, the team decided to target the broader 15- to 35-year-old segment, reasoning that it combines a taste for fashionable electronics with enough spare cash to justify buying a stand-alone remote.\n\nThus, they endorsed a robust infra-red link and concluded their chosen market would have sufficient disposable income to purchase the product.",
    "Members accept that basing the Pupil Development Grant on eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is an imprecise proxy for deprivation, yet they see no practicable alternative at present.  Kirsty Williams described FSM status as \u201cprobably the best that we\u2019ve got\u201d until the effects of universal credit are clearer and a wider consultation can be held.  The Committee explored ideas such as an Ever-2 or Ever-6 model or widening definitions to include adopted children, but acknowledged the financial and data-sharing obstacles.  Consequently, the group\u2019s settled view is that, while FSM is blunt and excludes some disadvantaged learners, it remains the only workable trigger for funding in the short term.\n\nOn attendance and wider engagement, the group judges PDG\u2019s impact as mixed.  They noted encouraging individual examples\u2014Brynteg Primary\u2019s whole-school \u201cgrowth-mindset\u201d work, a north-Wales primary that funds teaching assistants to operate a daily walking-bus, and Ysgol y Preseli\u2019s family liaison programme.  Estyn monitoring shows overall attendance has risen and PDG schools tend to use evidence-based interventions.  However, the attendance gap is still stark: only 35 % of FSM pupils reach 95 %+ attendance compared with 60 % of their peers, and temporary exclusions remain disproportionately high.  Members concluded that PDG can and does improve engagement when targeted well, but its effectiveness is uneven across Wales and depends heavily on strong school leadership, rigorous pupil-level tracking and multi-agency support.  Strengthening regional PDG advisers and sharing proven approaches were identified as the next steps to secure more consistent, measurable gains.",
    "The professor regarded both ideas as worth exploring but remained cautiously non-committal.\n\nOn support vector machines (SVMs) he said they are \u201csort of a condensed nearest-neighbour\u2019\u2019 approach that stores only the critical training examples, so the parameter set can stay small and learning with limited data may be easier than with large neural nets or Gaussian mixtures. He noted that SVM distances can be converted to posterior probabilities with a sigmoidal mapping, so they can in principle drive a normal HMM decoder. However, the only sizeable speech work he knew\u2014Mississippi State\u2019s pilot recogniser\u2014produced results that were \u201cOK \u2026 not earth-shattering.\u2019\u2019 He had not seen rigorous head-to-head tests on large-vocabulary tasks and therefore viewed SVMs as an interesting experiment rather than a proven upgrade.\n\nRegarding speech-rate algorithms, the professor felt they should be added only if they demonstrate robustness beyond small, controlled databases. He cautioned that many techniques give encouraging numbers on connected-digit or clean read-speech tests, yet break down when faced with noisier, spontaneous material such as Switchboard or Broadcast News. His advice was to treat rate-of-speech compensation as a later-stage refinement: first confirm that the front-end and acoustic modelling work reliably on broad data, then see whether an explicit speaking-rate normaliser still buys accuracy. In short, he was open to both SVMs and speech-rate compensation but considered each unproven; systematic, scale-appropriate evaluations would be needed before either could replace the lab\u2019s current methods.",
    "The professor draws a clear conceptual line between three signal\u2013processing issues:\n\n1. Echoes.  He regards the audible \u201cghost\u201d phones that show up after mean-subtraction or long-window re-synthesis as artefacts created by the processing rather than by the room itself.  Because the echoes usually ride in the very low-energy portions of the waveform, he argues they can be suppressed without harming intelligible speech.  Simple tactics such as high-pass filtering, energy-based voice-activity detection, or explicitly zeroing frames whose energy falls below a threshold should retain foreground speech while discarding most of the echo.\n\n2. Reverberation.  The professor uses the word in two senses: natural room reverberation (\u22480.7\u20130.8 s RT in the Meeting Recorder room) and the pseudo-reverberation introduced by non-causal analysis windows.  In either case, he believes the worst perceptual and recognition damage comes from low-energy \u201ctails.\u201d  He therefore endorses classic Hirsch high-pass filtering and Avendano\u2013Hermansky style energy \u201cflooring\u201d that clip or attenuate those tails.  He stresses that removing low-energy bins is perfectly legitimate even if it departs from strict signal fidelity, because the goal is a cleaner recognition front end, not a perfect acoustic replica.\n\n3. Acoustic events.  In contrast to echoes and reverberation, which he treats as noise to be removed, the professor sees acoustic events as positive, information-bearing landmarks.  Events are bottom-up, data-observable changes\u2014onsets, spectral edges, formant bursts\u2014that would make neurons \u201cfire.\u201d  They differ from linguistically defined features, which are top-down abstractions.  He encourages building robust, auditory-inspired event detectors and combining their outputs with traditional features in recognisers, because properly detected events can anchor phones and words and provide resilience in noise.\n\nTaken together, his view is pragmatic: eliminate low-energy reverberant clutter, but keep\u2014or explicitly detect\u2014salient, high-energy acoustic events that convey linguistic information.",
    "After reviewing dozens of sketches and market cues, the team converged on a \u201ckeep-it-simple, feel-it-in-the-dark\u201d user-interface concept. They rejected voice-command operation and iPod-style touch wheels as too costly and risky, and instead agreed on a compact, hand-fitting remote that relies on conventional push-button technology\u2014an area where their manufacturing group already excels.\n\nKey interface elements they approved:\n\n\u2022 Central four-way navigation ring (up-down-left-right with an \u201center\u201d in the middle).  \n\u2022 Two recessed rocker buttons on the flanks for volume and channel; these must be depressed to prevent accidental changes and will be clearly labelled.  \n\u2022 Oversized, back-lit number keys for direct channel entry; illumination will default to the corporate yellow.  \n\u2022 A dedicated \u201cfind-me\u201d button: when whistled or clapped at, the remote emits a beep/LED flash, satisfying the locator requirement without full speech recognition.  \n\u2022 On-screen menus: rather than placing an LCD on the remote, pressing \u201cmenu\u201d will summon a slim guide bar on the TV itself, keeping hardware costs down.\n\nLook & feel decisions:\n\n\u2022 Base shell: hard black plastic for strength; over-moulded with a changeable latex sleeve so users can swap colours or the year\u2019s fruit-pattern trend while the Real Reaction logo remains visible in a small window.  \n\u2022 Size: smaller than last year\u2019s models\u2014roughly mobile-phone length\u2014to match \u201cthe smaller the hotter\u201d trend, yet thick enough for AAA or a single lithium cell.  \n\u2022 Tactility: the latex sleeve gives a soft, \u201cspongy\u201d grip consistent with Milan/Paris material trends and aids night-time orientation.\n\nIn summary, the chosen UI marries reliable push-buttons with limited, intuitive rockers, emphasizes tactile and visual cues, supports a screen-based menu to cut electronics cost, and uses interchangeable soft covers to keep the design fashionable without altering the underlying interface.",
    "During the cost-driven review the project manager made four clear points.\n\nPlastic material \u2013 He concluded the housing would have to move from the earlier rubber-over-mould to an all-plastic shell.  Going plastic, he said, \u201cpains me, but we might have to,\u201d because it cuts several euros per unit and lets the design slip back under the \u20ac12.5 target.  A solid, single-piece plastic body was therefore the baseline he proposed.\n\nChangeable cover \u2013 To keep some \u201cfashion\u201d appeal despite the cheaper shell, he liked the idea of selling inexpensive snap-on skins.  His view was \u201ca normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case,\u201d or other finishes bought separately.  That lets the core product stay low-cost while creating after-sales revenue and choice for style-conscious buyers.\n\nColour \u2013 Because colour adds \u20ac0.5 per unit, he first treated it as a luxury that \u201chas had to be put to one side.\u201d  Later, when marketing stressed fruit-and-veg styling, he accepted that bright \u201cflashy fruity colours\u201d should ship as the standard look for the youth market, with more subdued tones sold as premium extras.  If the button cost saving proved real, he was willing to reinstate a special colour.\n\nShape \u2013 To save tooling money he recommended abandoning the double-curved, fully ergonomic form in favour of a \u201csolid unit with a single curve design.\u201d  The single curve still permits limited articulation of the LCD for left- or right-hand use, but avoids the expense of a fully sculpted, rubberised body.\n\nIn summary, the manager backed a cost-controlled plastic shell, optional changeable covers, colour only if funds allowed (preferably bright by default), and a simplified single-curve shape to keep the project on budget.",
    "The team\u2019s main goal was to decide which experimental variants to \u201cfreeze\u201d as the official system before Tuesday\u2019s delivery and later maintain unchanged for the new German- and Danish-data runs.  Several candidate architectures were reviewed line-by-line in the results table.\n\n1.  Baseline position.  \u201cOGI-2\u201d (plain OGI features, no extra streams) serves as the published baseline.  A newer internal baseline, already about 22 % better through improved endpointing, is expected to become the official reference once all sites agree.\n\n2.  Promising improvements.  \n   \u2022 Two-stream \u201ccombo\u201d systems\u2014raw features plus low-pass\u2013filtered copies\u2014consistently beat the baseline.  \n   \u2022 Adding a KLT after the MLP further helps on well-matched and medium-mismatch sets.  \n   \u2022 Running the neural-net transformation in parallel with the acoustic front-end, rather than in series, yields the most reliable gains across corpora.  \n   \u2022 A secondary silence detector (\u201cfilt\u201d) lowers errors, but its extra 300 ms latency violates the handset/server delay budget, so those lines were removed from contention.\n\n3.  Performance trade-offs.  The best yellow-highlighted run improves most languages but hurts highly mismatched Italian; a neighbouring run without the low-pass branch does the opposite.  Both will be re-scored with the consortium\u2019s 40-30-30 weighting (TI-Digits / well-matched / other SpeechDat-Car) to pick the overall winner.\n\n4.  Significance and robustness.  Because score differences are only a few tenths of a percent, the group will mail exact test-set word counts and run significance tests before final selection.  They will also try a one-KLT variant and possibly variance-weighting of cepstra (e.g., down-weighting C1) but only if it can finish before the deadline.\n\nIn short, the system will be fixed early next week, probably using a two-stream, parallel-NN, KLT design that gives ~20 % improvement over the current baseline without violating latency constraints.",
    "Across the two hearings five linked themes emerged.\n\nLegislation:  Welsh witnesses urged a \u201cwhole-system\u201d Healthy Weight Bill. Suggested powers include banning price-promotions and energy-drinks, tighter planning rules to curb fast-food outlets near schools, and updated school-meal regulations to cut sugar.  In Ottawa MPs debated adding anti-tax-haven conditions to the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility, requiring strict audit of CERB fraud, and bringing forward a buy-back law to accompany the May 1 assault--style-rifle regulations.\n\nSports infrastructure:  Several AMs stressed that new \u201c21st-century schools\u201d must be built with changing rooms, toilets and shared-use agreements so communities can use gyms and pitches after hours.  The Chief Medical Officer backed using health-impact assessments to embed such facilities in all public builds.\n\nEnergy and tourism support:  Canadian ministers confirmed liquidity loans for both small and large oil-and-gas firms, plus $1-billion of credit through EDC; opposition MPs pressed for equivalent support for forestry and for Indigenous energy contractors.  In Atlantic Canada $40 million was added to ACOA to shore up seasonal tourism; local MPs sought help for the Yarmouth-Bar Harbor ferry and for operators whose landlords refuse to join the rent-relief scheme.\n\nGreen-economy and SME funding:  Cabinet members acknowledged that post-COVID recovery must accelerate a low-carbon transition, but insisted current cash-flow measures\u2014 wage subsidies, BCAP loans, and rent relief\u2014remain the immediate priority for small firms.  Bloc MPs argued that forestry, a \u201cready-made green sector\u201d, deserves the same $500 million credit facility given to the Coastal GasLink pipeline.\n\nCovid-19 impacts:  Harvesters reported market collapses; lobster fishers, processors and out-of-season crews still lack tailored income support.  Tourism regions fear a lost summer if border closures persist.  Oil prices, already battered by the global glut, led MPs to warn of shut-ins without swift federal credit.",
    "The team agreed that the remote should remain a \u201cTV-only\u201d controller with just the essential buttons \u2013 power, channel up/down, volume, mute and a single tele-text/menu key. Extra DVD/VCR keys and elaborate LCD pages were rejected as confusing, costly and unnecessary; speech recognition and a scroll-wheel were left as optional add-ons that must not compromise the basic, easy-to-learn layout.\n\nEveryone wanted to abandon the usual flat rectangle. Early sketches ranged from an hour-glass double-curve to explicit bananas and other fruit. After comparing ergonomics and tooling limits, they chose one continuous (single-curve) profile: wide at the top for the thumb-pad, gently tapering in the middle for grip and flaring slightly at the base so it can stand in its charging/locator cradle. This form still feels \u201corganic\u201d but allows a central i-Pod-style button and keeps manufacturing simple.\n\nPersonalisation was a major selling idea. The electronics sit in a standard inner shell while a soft, spongy rubber outer \u201cskin\u201d snaps on. Skins can be moulded in bright, fruit-inspired colours or subtle textures, letting users buy several and swap them. Costing showed a spare skin would add only about \u20ac0.80, so the concept stays within the \u20ac12.50 build target (total unit cost calculated at \u20ac11.90).\n\nThe novel fruit imagery split opinion: marketing loved the attention-grabbing look; usability experts feared awkward grip. The compromise is to keep the single-curve core and let the skins supply the \u201cbroccoli\u201d, \u201cstrawberry\u201d or plain finish, so buyers who dislike overt novelty can pick a neutral cover.\n\nConsequently, the final casing specification is: single-curved ABS/plastic core, over-moulded with interchangeable, spongy rubber skins available in several fruit-inspired colours and textures.",
    "Marketing proposed offering the remote in \u201clemon\u201d or \u201clime\u201d for two connected reasons. Their research showed an emerging European style trend toward fruit- and vegetable-inspired products\u2014bright, natural colours combined with softer, friendlier materials. Consumers now want devices that look fashionable first and functional second; in the survey \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d outranked pure functionality. Adopting lemon-yellow or lime-green lets the remote echo this wider lifestyle trend, instantly signalling that it is current, playful and innovative rather than another dark plastic \u201cbrick.\u201d\n\nThe palette also supports practical branding and usability goals. \u201cLemon\u201d ties directly to the company\u2019s existing corporate yellow, so the product can carry the brand identity without extra graphics. Both hues are vivid, making the remote easy to spot in dim living-room conditions\u2014solving the common complaint of dark remotes disappearing between cushions. Finally, anchoring the design in a single fruit theme gives the team a coherent story they can extend to textures (soft, \u201cspongy\u201d finishes reminiscent of fruit skin) and optional illuminated covers, strengthening shelf appeal and enabling future variants. \n\nIn short, lemon or lime colours align the product with a documented market trend toward vibrant, produce-inspired fashion, while simultaneously enhancing visibility, reinforcing brand colour, and providing a unifying concept for further design features.",
    "The evaluation team agreed that, after incorporating the updated project requirements, the prototype largely fulfils the key objectives that emerged from market research.  \n\nStyle \u2011 The shell-shaped, flip-open handset with interchangeable coloured fascias, a light plastic body, soft rubber edging and a small touch-screen was judged to give the \u201cfashion-plus-electronics\u201d look users said they would pay extra for.  Its distinctive form and bright fruit-and-vegetable tones also address the \u201ceasy-to-find\u201d concern highlighted by 50 % of respondents.\n\nMarket research alignment \u2011 Findings that most owners use only a handful of buttons and dislike bulky, uniform remotes led to the pared-down front face (power, channel, volume) and burying seldom-used functions on the internal touch-screen.  Users\u2019 willingness to pay more for an attractive unit justified retaining custom fascias and the rechargeable power pack while dropping costlier voice-recognition from the base model.  The team viewed the resulting bill of materials (\u2248\u20ac25 retail) as comfortably inside the head-office cost target.\n\nAdjustments for the new brief \u2011 Teletext, VCR and multi-device control were removed, Videoplus codes substituted for elaborate timer keys, and a low-cost beeper in the TV base is proposed for \u201clost remote\u201d location.  Standard IR transmission and one rechargeable cell replace triple-A batteries; the voice module is held back for a later \u201cbusiness-class\u201d version.\n\nMinimising repetitive strain injury \u2011 A curved \u201cbanana\u201d profile, larger rubberised keys and reduced key-press frequency (touch panel + limited front buttons) give measurable ergonomic improvements, but the team acknowledged RSI remains the weakest criterion, earning only a neutral score in their self-rating matrix.  Nevertheless, they judged current technology incapable of further gains without inflating cost or complexity, so the design was cleared to move to full prototype and consumer testing.",
    "Assessments on the future of institutions  \nMembers from all parties stressed that Canada\u2019s key institutions\u2014Parliament, the justice system, police services and post-secondary establishments\u2014face acute tests.  Conservatives warned that extended closure of the House weakens democratic oversight, while Bloc and NDP speakers urged a full, public reassessment of systemic discrimination embedded in policing and courts.  HEFCW officials, appearing on Brexit-related impacts, forecast \u201cturbulence\u201d for universities but judged them financially manageable provided Diamond and Reid funding flows materialise and UK research links are preserved.  Overall, witnesses and MPs agreed that institutional resilience will hinge on predictable funding, transparent governance and a swift resolution of pandemic-related uncertainties.  \n\nDiscussions on women\u2019s issues  \nWomen\u2019s economic security and safety ran through several exchanges.  Ministers were pressed to extend CERB for women whose sectors remain shuttered and to ensure that gender-based analysis (GBA+) is applied to every support programme\u2014especially for pregnant workers and new mothers who risk losing benefits.  MPs cited the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, demanding accelerated action on its Calls for Justice.  Child-care affordability was highlighted as essential for women re-entering the workforce, and government was urged to legislate a nation-wide system.  \n\nCommittee statements on housing  \nThe committee heard repeated criticism of slow progress on the $4 billion Canada Housing Benefit and on delivery of affordable units promised under the National Housing Strategy.  Members asked the Minister to adopt the non-profit sector\u2019s principles, make housing a central post-COVID stimulus, and expand rent-relief so families in core housing need can remain housed during the crisis.  The minister committed to maintaining federal leadership, but acknowledged only one province had signed the benefit agreement to date.  \n\nMembers\u2019 wider discussions  \nBeyond these themes, MPs debated racism, border restrictions, firearms policy, Auditor-General funding, agricultural aid, tourism support, international students, rural broadband and the wage-subsidy roll-out.  Personal tributes to front-line workers, volunteers and graduating students punctuated proceedings, illustrating Parliament\u2019s continuing attempt to balance constituency concerns with national crisis management.",
    "Participants reviewed progress and next steps for the \u201cMeeting Recorder\u201d digit corpus.  Adam reported that almost every meeting now has its spoken\u2010digit segment recorded; only a few forms are still blank because the speaker missed the session.  Once those gaps are filled, the corpus will rival TI-Digits in size and can be used to train and evaluate recognisers.\n\nExtraction workflow: Adam\u2019s X-Waves scripts display the target sequence (e.g. \u201csix nine nine two two\u201d), let an annotator highlight the exact region, press \u201cR\u201d, and automatically log start/stop times in a standard file.  He has hand-processed eight meetings this way but proposed handing routine extraction and header entry (speaker name, date, times) to the professional transcribers.  Jane and Don agreed this fits the transcribers\u2019 skill set and would enrich the main transcripts, though they prefer Adam to keep the simple header typing so the hourly budget stays focused on words.\n\nExperimental plan:  \n\u2022 Train a baseline recogniser on the official TI-Digits training set, then test on the meeting digits.  Near-mike performance should be \u201creasonably good\u201d; distant-mike performance is expected to be poor and will serve as a long-term research target.  \n\u2022 Current numbers from SRI\u2019s adapted system are 3-4 % error on English near-mike meeting digits, versus ~0.8 % on pristine TI-Digits; the gap is attributed to far less training data, real background noise and spontaneous reading style.  \n\u2022 Aurora digits, with car noise, yield ~5 % error per digit, showing how quickly accuracy degrades in realistic conditions.\n\nFuture work includes exploring tandem features, articulatory-feature annotation, and factorial-HMM back-ends to close the performance gap, while continuing manual segmentation to deliver five minutes of tightly aligned multi-channel data from a dozen meetings for algorithm development.",
    "The four groups back the speech-recognition interface for overlapping but distinct reasons.\n\nUser Interface (system engineering) see voice control as a way to simplify the handset.  Replacing seldom-used keys with one-word commands (\u201con\u201d, \u201clouder\u201d, \u201cchannel up\u201d) cuts the button count, keeps the layout sleek and reduces the learning burden.  They also note that, if a robust recogniser is found, the feature becomes an eye-catching \u201cgimmick\u201d that differentiates the product without compromising usability.\n\nMarketing\u2019s case is commercial.  Surveys show that 75\u201390 % of 15- to 35-year-olds are willing to pay extra for speech control, and being first to ship it would give the brand a \u201ctrendy\u201d image and allow a price well above today\u2019s \u20ac25 norm.  They add a practical selling point: saying \u201cremote\u201d could make the handset beep, solving the common \u201clost remote\u201d complaint and providing a headline benefit that is easy to advertise.\n\nThe Industrial Designer focuses on feasibility and durability.  Voice input would let the enclosure remain slim, waterproof and \u201cunbreakable\u201d because it removes many mechanical keys.  If users accept a brief training phase, only a modest on-board chip is needed; in return the reduced number of moving parts lowers wear, and the spare space can house wireless or solar charging hardware that fits the designer\u2019s \u201cno-battery-door, robust shell\u201d concept.\n\nThe User-Interface Designer echoes the button-reduction argument and adds usage safeguards: limiting the vocabulary to unique words, or requiring a press-to-talk trigger, prevents TV dialogue from accidentally switching channels.  When those safeguards are in place, voice control offers effortless access to core functions while keeping the interface visually minimal.\n\nTogether, these viewpoints frame speech recognition as a market-winning, design-friendly and user-centred enhancement.",
    "The witnesses and Members agreed that Wales\u2019s four regional school-improvement consortia are now an indispensable \u201cmiddle tier\u201d between local authorities and schools.  Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, said she now sees regional working as essential because it gives small councils the critical mass they lack individually; her priority is \u201coptimum delivery\u201d, not structural uniformity.  Attitudes nevertheless vary.  Members praised good practice in Central South and the EAS but voiced frustration that support remains patchy and that ERW is in \u201ca particularly worrying\u201d state, with cancelled meetings, staff losses and Neath Port Talbot signalling its withdrawal.\n\nEstyn\u2019s Strategic Director Jassa Scott reported that since the 2017 monitoring round consortia \u201chave improved their knowledge of individual schools\u201d and are better at targeting literacy and numeracy, yet support for digital competence and for secondary schools is still weaker than for primaries.  In schools causing concern advisers \u201care not always focused on improving teaching and learning\u201d, partly because consortia struggle to recruit secondary specialists.  Estyn cannot presently inspect consortia directly; Scott suggested that placing them on a statutory footing \u2013 perhaps via corporate joint committees \u2013 would allow the Auditor General and Estyn to scrutinise them formally and end continuing \u201ccapacity risks\u201d.\n\nOn 8 June Canada\u2019s Public Safety Minister Bill Blair was pressed about the record seizure of 65 handguns at Toronto Pearson Airport.  He replied that \u201cgun violence in any of our communities is unacceptable\u201d, highlighted CBSA\u2019s success at the border, and said the seizure shows why Ottawa will \u201cstrengthen gun control\u201d and remove \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons\u201d from society as part of wider efforts to maintain social stability.\n\nPolitically, the evidence formed part of the Senedd\u2019s inquiry into raising school standards, while the Canadian exchanges occurred during the COVID-19 Special Committee\u2014illustrating how both legislatures use committee scrutiny to hold minority governments to account and to refine policies intended to improve public services and community safety.",
    "The team identified three major categories of remote-control functions.\n\n1. Lost-and-found feature (realised).  \nEarly brainstorming produced a \u201choming\u201d idea: the remote should signal its location when misplaced. Options debated were a light that blinks in darkness, an audible beep triggered by clapping, and a darkness sensor that activates automatically when the handset is buried under papers or fabric. During later meetings the concept was refined into a charging cradle with a \u201cfind\u201d button\u2014pressing the base would make the remote emit a tone, similar to cordless-phone systems. The group agreed the locator must fit the cost cap but kept it on the final requirements list.\n\n2. Functions improved during project evaluation.  \nIn the evaluation session the team pared the interface down to core buttons (power, channel \u00b1, volume \u00b1, mute, 0-9 and a single menu key) while enlarging those controls for older users. Duplicate keys (e.g., one of two mute buttons) may be removed to free space and budget for advanced features. Ergonomics were upgraded to a rounded, \u201csnail\u201d or kidney shape that fits one hand; soft rubber keys and a prominent raised power button were added. Colour coding (blue body, yellow accents, fluorescent green menu key) and a second LED for \u201cfeedback flash\u201d improve usability and brand visibility.\n\n3. Newly brainstormed capabilities.  \nBeyond television control, the remote could become a household hub: switching A/V devices, adjusting HVAC temperature, or accessing teletext. The most distinctive new idea is on-board speech recognition\u2014users could say \u201cchannel five\u201d instead of pressing numbers. Other suggestions included hidden panels for seldom-used setup keys, universal smart-chip support for multiple devices, rechargeable batteries, and subtitle/audio toggles accessible through the single menu button.\n\nTogether these discussions shaped a compact, trend-oriented remote that is easy to locate, easy to use, and technologically differentiated.",
    "During the cost-break-down in the finance segment the team discovered that every \u201cspecial colour\u201d carried a surcharge on the bill of materials.  Initially the plan was to have a brightly coloured case plus up to three different accent colours on the buttons so the presets, volume/channel rockers and central menu key would all stand out and reinforce the fun, \u201cfruity\u201d brand image.  However, once the spreadsheet showed the running total drifting well above the \u20ac12.50 target, the Industrial Designer suggested a quick saving:  \u201clet\u2019s have our buttons all be one colour.\u201d  The Project-manager agreed, noting that treating every key as the same mould/colour would drop the \u201cspecial colour\u201d count from three to one and immediately pull the component cost down.  In other words, the group\u2019s consensus was pragmatic\u2014 special colours were nice, but in a tight budget they were the easiest luxury to cut.\n\nMarketing objected because the change undercut two of their core goals.  First, their positioning strategy relied on vivid, differentiated buttons to give the remote an eye-catching, fashion-oriented look that would appeal to younger buyers while still allowing a conservative \u201ccorporate\u201d version (yellow case with black keys).  Flattening the colour scheme to a single tint erased that visual excitement and, in their view, made the product \u201cjust any other remote control.\u201d  Second, colour variety was supposed to help users recognise functions quickly; losing the red channel keys, yellow menu key, etc., weakened the instant usability story they had prepared for advertising.  Hence Marketing saw the one-colour compromise as a purely finance-driven cut that sacrificed both branding and user appeal, leaving them \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the final button decision.",
    "Members highlighted three distinct issues.  \n\nWelsh dimension  \n\u2022  The Minister confirmed the new curriculum will embed \u201cWelshness\u201d across every Area of Learning and Experience, not just in history.  Practical examples include showing pupils Wales\u2019s pioneering role in coding when they study computer science.  \n\u2022  Schools will need high-quality bilingual resources.  A separate work-stream is mapping gaps and may produce a national on-line directory so teachers can locate Welsh-specific texts, case-studies and digital materials quickly.  \n\u2022  The language continuum must be \u201ccontextualised\u201d; progression expectations for Welsh will differ in Welsh-medium and English-medium settings, but every learner should encounter a meaningful Welsh cultural and linguistic experience.\n\nEmployers and the Welsh Baccalaureate  \n\u2022  FE principals, ColegauCymru and industry representatives agreed that most employers do not understand the purpose or content of the Welsh Bacc/Skills Challenge Certificate.  The name itself hides what is \u201cin the tin\u201d.  \n\u2022  Because recognition is patchy, the qualification is rarely raised at employer boards; firms still focus on vocational or A-level results, attendance and basic skills.  \n\u2022  Witnesses called for a fresh review shaped by employers, clearer marketing and stronger, structured links between schools/colleges and businesses (for example through social-value contracts, Career Ready or WorldSkills) so companies see the Bacc developing the teamwork, research and problem-solving skills they need.\n\nIndependent inspection for Wales  \n\u2022  Estyn argued that retaining a stand-alone Welsh inspectorate brings tangible benefits compared with subsuming inspection into an England-led model.  \n\u2022  Independence allows Estyn to align scrutiny tightly with Welsh policy, use peer-inspectors and school nominees, and feed live evidence into curriculum reform.  \n\u2022  Regular external reviews (Professor Donaldson\u2019s being the latest) keep Estyn itself under challenge, ensuring inspection remains relevant while providing the profession and the public with an impartial, Wales-focused judgement on standards.",
    "The team generally judged the presentation aids they were given as more awkward than helpful. PowerPoint drew the strongest criticism: both the industrial designer and the user-interface specialist called it \u201cstupid\u201d or said they \u201cnever touch\u201d Microsoft tools, and several people felt the slides did little more than force them to \u201cmake up\u201d content or repeat information they already knew.  Because files were locked into proprietary formats, some members had to \u201ctrack someone down\u201d for legacy software or were unable to open the reference sites others used, which reinforced the sense that the medium, not the message, was dictating the process.\n\nBy contrast, low-tech tools were viewed positively.  When the project manager asked about the whiteboard pens, the group agreed they were \u201cnicer\u201d because the ink appeared immediately and let them focus on the discussion instead of the screen.  The microphones earned only lukewarm approval: they worked \u201cokay when you\u2019re sitting down\u201d but became \u201cclumsy\u201d whenever someone stood up to write, so their convenience was situational at best.\n\nFinally, the participants questioned the value of the elaborate recording system\u2014video, audio, and transcripts\u2014for everyday work.  Several argued that most real meetings convey so little new information that a missed session could be summarized \u201cin one sentence,\u201d making a two-hour playback more burden than benefit.\n\nIn sum, the group found simple, tangible materials (pens, whiteboard) convenient and intuitive, while digital slideware, proprietary file formats, and meeting-capture technology were seen as cumbersome, distracting, or downright unnecessary.",
    "The group discarded the LCD option for several overlapping reasons that emerged during the two design discussions.\n\n1. Limited usefulness for television control. An LCD on the handset could only show menus the remote itself generated. Because the remote sends one-way infrared signals, it cannot receive programme data back from the TV or set-top box, so it could not display channel names, EPG listings or status information the user really wants. As the industrial designer put it, the user would \u201clook down at the LCD and then back up at the TV\u201d, gaining little.\n\n2. Size, readability and lighting issues. To keep the remote small and fashionable, the screen would have to be tiny and therefore hard to read. It would need its own back-light because people use remotes in darkened rooms, adding bulk and draining power.\n\n3. Cost and technical overhead. An LCD demands an \u201cadvanced\u201d logic chip instead of the simple or regular chip needed for push-buttons or even a scroll wheel, and it increases battery requirements. The team\u2019s cost-saving strategy was to put money into the kinetic/battery hybrid and the rubber fashion casing rather than \u201coverly technological\u201d components.\n\n4. Conflict with the simplicity goal. Marketing research showed users value fancy look & feel but still want ease of use. Hiding non-essential functions in on-screen TV menus and keeping only large, tactile buttons on the handset met that brief better than a miniature LCD with nested menus.\n\nTaken together\u2014questionable user benefit, visibility problems, higher power and chip costs, and a desire for a clean, fashion-led exterior\u2014the LCD display was judged not worth pursuing.",
    "At the first session everyone stated name, role and a \u201cfavourite animal\u201d to break the ice: Heather was Project-Manager, Andrew Marketing, Craig User-Interface and David Industrial-Designer.  Those roles stayed constant throughout the work.\n\nProject introduction followed: the team must create a television remote that looks \u201cfresh and trendy\u201d, stays user-friendly, sells for \u20ac25 and costs no more than \u20ac12.50 to build, with a target revenue of \u20ac50 million across Europe.  Early ambitions included solar cells, kinetic charging, a locator, an LCD help screen and rubber back-lighting.\n\nBrain-storming ran over several meetings.  Members listed annoyances with existing remotes\u2014too many keys, hard to find in the dark, easy to lose\u2014and sketched alternatives with Play-Doh and the smart-board.  Ideas jumped from a \u201csnow-man\u201d shell to a bright yellow \u201cbanana\u201d unit sitting in a leaf-shaped charging cradle.  Core features gradually converged on two scroll wheels (volume / channel or tele-text), a single \u201cturbo\u201d trigger for power and rapid zapping, a beeper locator and optional LCD feedback.  Alongside looks they constantly checked the component cost sheet, debating whether to drop solar cells, rubber casing or the advanced chip to meet budget.\n\nProject evaluation used a 1\u20137 consensus scale for \u201cfancy\u201d, \u201chandy\u201d, \u201cfunctional\u201d and two buying questions.  Scores clustered around 5\u20136 for style and ergonomics but fell to 2\u20134 on personal purchase likelihood, revealing generational taste differences.  A later cost pass showed the banana still \u20ac4 over target; the LCD and special plastics were removed, scroll wheels were kept and button count cut, squeezing the bill under \u20ac12.50.\n\nProcess-wise the team cycled through introduction, individual idea work, joint meetings for convergence, prototype and finance checks, and will finish with Heather\u2019s final specification report and an external user test with \u201cyoung trend-setters\u201d.",
    "When the conversation turned to \u201cspecial\u201d add-ons, the idea of making the remote rechargeable surfaced together with the locator-base that would beep or flash. \u2028Initial reactions were positive: the project manager liked the notion that users would \u201cnever have the battery problem,\u201d felt it fitted the \u20ac25 target price, and argued that offshore production would keep added costs down.  The user-interface specialist echoed the convenience angle, pointing out that a charging base could also house the finder button, eliminating the need for disposable cells altogether.\n\nHowever, reservations appeared almost immediately.  The industrial designer stressed that two AA batteries already power most remotes for several years, so a charger offered little real benefit while adding electronics, size and complexity.  He warned that both the handset and the base would need additional components\u2014transformer, contacts, larger housing\u2014which could threaten the strict cost and space limits.  Marketing questioned whether customers would actually pay extra for rechargeability, urging a cost-benefit check against the \u20ac12.50 production ceiling.\n\nThe team therefore left the feature open but downgraded its priority.  They agreed to explore two fallback options:  \u20281) keep ordinary AA pen-lite cells but allow users to employ their own rechargeable versions;  \u20282) design the base primarily as a locator station and add charging contacts only if the numbers still work.  In the project manager\u2019s words, the recharge function would be \u201cthe first thing to skip\u201d if costs climbed.  Thus, while seen as attractive, a rechargeable unit remained a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d contingent on later feasibility and budgeting analysis.",
    "The group agreed that the present mix of lapel, head-mounted and table mikes is introducing avoidable acoustic variability that hurts both recognition accuracy and transcription effort.  After discussing alternatives, they decided to standardise on one close-talking, head-mounted microphone model for every speaker and to phase out the lapel units.  Key elements of the decision are:\n\n\u2022\tAdopt a single headset that positions the boom a thumb\u2019s width from the corner of the mouth, eliminating breathing noise and giving uniform gain and spectral balance.  \n\u2022\tOrder enough of this model (\u201ca half-dozen or so\u201d) to cover every recording channel\u2014wired or wireless\u2014plus a few spares, so that each participant always wears the same type.  \n\u2022\tAdd one additional wireless transmitter/receiver pair so the full complement of headsets can remain cordless; wiring vs. radio was judged \u201csecond-order,\u201d but uniform transducer quality is essential.  \n\u2022\tBefore bulk purchasing, buy one sample of the recommended Crown CM-311-AE (or similar) and let several people try it for comfort; if it is clearly better than the current Sony units, the team will buy nine identical headsets.  \n\u2022\tDocument a standard wearing procedure and brief all participants at the start of meetings to ensure consistent placement each time.  \n\nUsing a single, good-quality headset for every speaker should remove a significant confound for downstream work in speech recognition, prosody and dialogue analysis, and should also make life easier for the human transcribers who have complained about uneven channel quality.",
    "Meilyr Rowlands told the Committee that secondary schools face markedly tougher conditions than primaries.  Curriculum reform must be phased in \u201cyear-by-year\u201d because secondaries have larger staffs, subject silos and heavier qualification pressures; many are already battling deficits and difficulties recruiting specialist teachers.  Those factors make it harder for them to release staff for professional learning and to give pupils the consistent relationships that underpin good pastoral care.  Rowlands added that, when weaknesses do arise, secondaries take \u201cjust over two years on average\u201d to move out of special measures and therefore need earlier, multi-agency identification and support.\n\nKirsty Williams AM addressed operational safety.  She stressed that any wider reopening of schools will happen only \u201cwhen it is safe to do so\u201d and when the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientific Adviser advise that viral transmission is low enough.  Her five principles include protecting the \u201cphysical and emotional well-being of children, young people and staff\u201d, aligning with wider Welsh-Government public-health actions, and giving schools time to solve practical issues such as social distancing inside classrooms, school transport and avoiding gatherings at the gate.  Mass testing, contact tracing and the ability to quarantine symptomatic cases will be central to that safety plan.\n\nOn emotional and mental-health support, Williams announced extra funding for local authorities to expand school-based counselling and therapeutic help.  During lockdown those services are being delivered by telephone, video or family-therapy models, with money also earmarked for counsellors\u2019 professional development so they can work in new ways.\n\nRegarding learning from home, the Minister thanked parents, urged them \u201cnot to be too hard on themselves\u201d, and highlighted the Stay Safe. Stay Learning programme on Hwb.  Government is lending repurposed laptops, Chromebooks and Mi-Fi devices to pupils without equipment or connectivity, while schools track engagement and contact families who may need extra help.",
    "During the detailed-design meeting, Sebastian, the Industrial Designer, supported the \u201cball\u201d concept but immediately framed it in terms of practicality, durability and intuitive use.  \n\nDesign.  He liked the sphere\u2019s inherent robustness\u2014\u201cthe ball is a nice idea because of its stability\u201d\u2014yet pointed out that a perfect sphere would simply roll away.  His remedy was to \u201chave it flat on one side at least,\u201d or add small grip areas, so it could rest securely on a table and be easy to pick up.  He also questioned the proposed flip-open hinge: a lid would break easily and, in reality, \u201cit\u2019s probably going to lie around opened all the time,\u201d sacrificing both reliability and cost.  Overall, he stressed the need for a compromise between striking form and functional feasibility.\n\nStyle.  While agreeing the remote must look \u201ctrendy,\u201d he reminded the team that materials and finish must survive everyday abuse\u2014children throwing it, frequent drops\u2014without the price climbing above the \u20ac12.50 target.  He asked whether the casing should be built to \u201clast longer or rather have people buy one every half-year,\u201d implicitly balancing chic styling with manufacturing economy.\n\nFunctions.  Sebastian reiterated earlier goals of universality and modern connectivity: one handset \u201cshould control one or more pieces of equipment\u201d via Bluetooth in addition to infrared so users needn\u2019t point directly at the TV.  Button layout had to be finger-searchable; users should \u201cgrab it and not have to look at it\u201d to know orientation, perhaps aided by sensors or a subtle front\u2013back cue.  He also floated selectively lit buttons or a small display so only relevant controls were visible, keeping the interface simple.\n\nIn short, he endorsed the spherical theme but insisted on flattening, ruggedising and simplifying it while adding universal, point-free communication and intuitive cues to make the stylish shape genuinely usable.",
    "Committee members and HEFCW witnesses agree that student mobility is already under strain and regard this as a serious, immediate problem.  They stress that Erasmus+ remains the most efficient, best-recognised and least costly mechanism for Welsh learners, noting its established infrastructure and powerful brand.  The preferred solution is therefore to keep Wales, and the UK as a whole, inside the post-2020 Erasmus successor scheme; Welsh Government is urged to press UK ministers hard on that point.  If continued participation proves impossible, universities will still be expected to protect outward mobility, but this would be less efficient, require new administrative structures and demand extra money.  Seven of the eight Welsh universities have already written commitments into their latest fee-and-access plans to use a slice of tuition-fee income for mobility bursaries should Erasmus funding disappear, and members indicated they might in future make such self-funding an explicit performance expectation.  In short, Erasmus is viewed as the best answer; failing that, institutions must finance alternative schemes from their own resources.\n\nOn tuition-fee refunds, the group\u2019s position is cautious.  Officials pointed out that teaching, assessment and support are being moved on-line and quality-assured; long-standing appeal routes through students\u2019 unions, institutional complaints procedures and the UK-wide Office of the Independent Adjudicator already exist.  Provided learning outcomes are met, they see no case for an automatic, sector-wide rebate.  Individual students who feel short-changed can pursue redress through those established channels, but a blanket refund is not advocated.",
    "Across the meetings members examined five recurring themes.\n\nLocal authoritative frameworks:  Legislators stressed that decisions must respect existing jurisdictional lines.  In Canada, witnesses urged Ottawa to transfer health funds to provinces without federal conditions and to leave municipal policing reform to local authorities while still setting national use-of-force standards.  In Wales, AMs debated whether new post-16 legislation should merely replace HEFCW or create a wider commission able to plan provision jointly with schools, colleges and regional skills partnerships; concern centred on ensuring local control of teacher-training accreditation after the University of South Wales lost its licence.\n\nCondolences:  Statements of sympathy marked several losses: House tributes honoured Qu\u00e9bec mayor St\u00e9phane Lavoie, journalist Tristan Roy, and victims of COVID-19 and anti-Black violence, notably George Floyd.  Members thanked the military and health-care staff working in long-term-care homes.\n\nEmployment:  Governments outlined support packages\u2014Canada\u2019s CEWS, CERB and BCAP; Wales\u2019 part-time PGCE incentives and rural broadband\u2014to protect jobs.  MPs pressed for quicker delivery of CERB replacements, expanded CEBA loans and targeted aid for forestry, tourism and Canada\u2019s Legions.\n\nWorkers\u2019 safety:  Shortages of PPE, mental-health strain and the high opioid-death rate were highlighted.  Ministers detailed domestic PPE production, the armed forces\u2019 deployment in care homes and federal loan guarantees for safe re-opening.  Opposition members demanded race-based COVID data, safer policing practices, and quicker farm-worker protections.\n\nPay disputes:  Rising exclusion and funding pressures in Welsh FE colleges sparked a lecturers\u2019 strike threat; AMs urged resolving the 1 % offer and warned of looming pension costs.  In Canada, MPs condemned the Liberals\u2019 plan to draw the federal wage subsidy for partisan use and queried bonuses at the Canada Infrastructure Bank.\n\nIn sum, legislators balanced respect for local authority with urgent national action, voiced condolences for recent losses, and grappled with protecting employment, ensuring worker safety and settling pay conflicts during the pandemic.",
    "Speaking by video link from Whitehorse, the Yukon member rose on two quite separate matters of gratitude.\n\nFirst, he thanked the House of Commons itself.  This was an historic sitting in which MPs situated thousands of kilometres from Ottawa could still take part in the national debate.  By adopting the special COVID-19 procedures, equipping the Chamber with large screens and interpretation channels, and accepting remote statements as part of the official record, the House made it possible for a northern MP to address Parliament directly from Whitehorse on the traditional territory of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation and the Ta\u2019an Kw\u00e4ch\u2019\u00e4n Council.  That courtesy allowed him to highlight another milestone\u2014the creation, just last week, of Yukon University, Canada\u2019s first university north of 60\u2014as it happened, rather than weeks or months later.\n\nSecondly, he expressed thanks to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces.  Their teams have been deployed to the most hard-hit long-term-care homes in Ontario and Quebec, providing hands-on medical help and, even more importantly, recording and reporting appalling conditions that had been hidden from public view.  The Armed Forces\u2019 courage, professionalism and candour are now spurring urgent provincial and federal action to protect vulnerable seniors.  For those achievements\u2014saving lives today and driving systemic reform tomorrow\u2014the Yukon MP conveyed heartfelt appreciation to the CAF on behalf of northerners and all Canadians.\n\nIn short, the House was thanked for enabling truly national parliamentary participation, and the Armed Forces were thanked for their life-saving service and truth-telling in long-term-care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis.",
    "The team\u2019s core aim was to create an inexpensive, fashion-oriented television\u2013only remote that is instantly understandable and pleasant to handle.  After reviewing user tests showing that 90 % of time a remote is used only for power, channel and volume, they set a single, \u201cmost-critical\u201d functional requirement: the handset must let any user switch the TV on/off and change channel or volume quickly, with no learning curve.  All later ideas (paging beacon, voice input, colour skins, etc.) were judged only if they preserved that overriding simplicity and kept manufacturing cost below \u20ac12.50.\n\nFunctions agreed\n\u2022 Mandatory: Power, channel up/down, volume up/down, mute, on-screen menu key and a \u201cfind-me\u201d beeper triggered from a small wall/TV pod.  \n\u2022 Nice-to-have (subject to cost): momentary back-lighting instead of permanent glow plastics; optional voice commands for young users; rechargeable or long-life lithium cells.\n\nDesign-character points\n\u2022 Housing in tough, slightly curved recycled plastic or hard rubber so it survives drops and displays the firm\u2019s colours/logo (\u201cWe put fashion in electronics\u201d).  \n\u2022 Large, tactile, wear-proof keys or a small LCD touch area for the six core commands; remaining settings buried in sub-menus.  \n\u2022 Illumination limited to 10-second \u201cphone style\u201d light-up to save power.  \n\u2022 Dimensions sized for both large and small hands; colour portfolio split between bright \u201cfruit\u201d tones for youth and muted autumn tones for seniors.\n\nScroll feature\nThe group debated two versions:  \n1. A thumbwheel or side scroll-strip;  \n2. A circular iPod-like touch pad.  \nThey agreed scrolling is valuable when navigating deeper option pages or long channel lists and speeds set-up, but it must not replace the direct volume/channel keys.  Current preference is an iPod-style disc whose default action is channel surfing; pressing its centre toggles it to volume control, preserving both immediacy and menu-browsing convenience without adding extra buttons.",
    "For the next session the Project-Manager will open by confirming that everyone received last week\u2019s minutes, then present two items that just arrived from senior management: 1) revised product-cost and branding constraints and 2) a final decision to drop teletext support.  After that the team must make a concrete decision on the core remote-control functions.  Discussion will be steered through the three design levels already agreed\u2014user-requirements, functional design and working design\u2014so each discipline can state what must be kept, added or cut.\n\nSpecific points flagged for debate include:\n\u2022 whether voice-recognition stays in the spec despite its cost impact;\n\u2022 how to implement a \u201clost-remote finder\u201d without exceeding the \u20ac12.50 build limit;\n\u2022 battery versus solar-cell power and the effect on size, cost and environmental message;\n\u2022 confirmation that \u201csimplicity and fashion\u201d remain the primary design goals for the 15-to-35, style-driven market segment.\n\nMarketing will reprise its lab findings, stressing users\u2019 dislike of \u201cugly\u201d remotes and, critically, the high incidence of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).  Marketing wants the new unit to minimise thumb travel and grip pressure\u2014large, well-spaced buttons for volume and channel, sculpted casing and possibly a softer, rubberised surface\u2014to reduce carpal-tunnel-type complaints.\n\nThe group also plans a brief retrospective.  They will note that since the initial brainstorm they have progressed from isolated requirements to a working prototype with slide-out advanced controls, multi-colour IR feedback and provisional BOM pricing.  They recognise the need to resolve the solar-cell over-run, but feel the process has been creative, the technology aids useful and cross-team collaboration strong.  Each member will submit a written summary and updated concept (ID: component layout, UI: interface mock-ups, Marketing: trend watch) before the meeting so decisions can be finalised quickly.",
    "Lab observations with 100 test users showed that the profusion of small keys on today\u2019s remotes is counter-productive. Subjects used barely 10 % of the available keys; more than 80 % of all presses were limited to channel-up/down, volume-up/down and power. Respondents therefore asked for far fewer, larger, clearly grouped buttons and said they would pay extra for a handset that looked \u201csnazzy\u201d yet stayed simple.\n\nRegarding a \u201cfinder\u201d or \u201ccall\u201d feature, the team proposed adding a separate transmitter that could be stuck to, or built into, the TV. Pressing this external button would send a radio (preferred over I-R line-of-sight) signal to the remote, causing it to reveal itself. The handset would house a small receiver plus a buzzer; light or vibration could be added but the group felt an audible beep was cheapest and easiest to notice if the unit was wedged in a sofa. A charging cradle was mentioned but dropped as too costly; the locator should work with ordinary batteries.\n\nOn button layout the designers leaned toward extreme minimalism: one large power key, a thumb-operated disc or joystick for channel/volume, and one or two \u201cmode/menu\u201d keys. Numbers 0-9 might be retained only if voice input was abandoned; otherwise they could disappear from the casing. For the location circuit the schematic would pair a coin-cell-powered TV beacon with the remote\u2019s radio receiver, processor and piezo buzzer.\n\nWhen the marketing-oriented presentation touched on adaptive back-lighting, the whole team agreed to omit it. They judged the feature technically complex, of little interest to most buyers, and unnecessary for a TV-only controller.",
    "DAT recorders  \nThe group sees DAT-based corpora\u2014such as the newly released Santa Barbara conversations\u2014as a tempting supplemental resource. DAT gives clean, far-field recordings that might bootstrap a first recogniser for meetings and supply \u201cseed\u201d pronunciations for adaptation experiments. However, the team notes that importing DAT data only makes sense if someone is funded to develop noise-robust models; otherwise the extra material will sit unused. They therefore agree to request the DAT disks but to delay processing until a concrete adaptation project is staffed.\n\nPower-cable / microphone wiring  \nReplacing the uncomfortable Sony headset mikes with two Crown aerobics headsets raised cabling questions. Jim\u2019s plan is to build eight small \u201cbreak-out\u201d boxes: each box converts two lightweight headset leads to standard XLR lines and injects bias power. Bundling the eight power-audio runs inside a split plastic sleeve will keep the conference table tidy, while an LED on every box shows whether phantom power is present\u2014important because accidental unplugging is hard to detect upstream. The team prefers a wireless laptop interface (via the existing WaveLAN) for monitoring VU levels instead of leaving a fixed monitor in the room, so the new wiring should not obstruct other users of the space.\n\nCapturing subject intention  \nIn the tourist dialogue study, subjects had been parroting the wording of the prompt, defeating spontaneity. The revised design gives participants a schematic city map plus a list of abstract goals (\u201cbuy a souvenir\u201d, \u201ctake a photo\u201d, \u201ceat lunch\u201d). They mark destinations on the map, take the paper away, and then query the system freely. This is expected to elicit genuine intentions while still letting researchers know the ground-truth goal set. For subsequent analysis the team will encode each utterance with layered \u201crich action descriptions\u201d: an action-schema label (Enter, View, Approach, etc.), a relevant image-schema (Source-Path-Goal, Force, Commerce), and cross-links that bind roles (source, path, goal) to domain objects, enabling both linguistic and plan-level inference.",
    "The team first listed the functional basics \u2013 few large buttons, battery power with an optional docking-charger, small LCD, and a flat-to-single-curved housing supplied by manufacturing.  Discussion then centred on the exterior.  Trend-watch data showed elderly users like \u201ctelephone-shaped\u201d products and warm finishes, so wood-look and dark-grey plastics were proposed.  Because real wood is expensive, marketing suggested selling one core remote with changeable outer shells.  Interchangeable covers would let buyers \u201cdress up\u201d the product, create gift possibilities (\u201cGive grand-dad a new cover\u201d), and keep tooling costs low.  The whole group agreed, so the specification now reads: one electronics core plus optional wood-grain or black plastic snap-on cases; covers will be sold separately.\n\nShape was refined next.  A single-curved profile was chosen over flat or double-curved because it tilts the small display toward the user yet still lies safely on a table; the remote need not stand upright.  Left-hand ergonomics were debated but judged unnecessary\u2014 the standard right-side channel rocker and left-side volume rocker remain.\n\nSeveral later cost-driven revisions affected the general spec but not the changeable-case idea.  To reach the \u20ac12.5 build target, the team dropped voice recognition, kinetic charging, most rubber trim and, finally, the LCD/advanced chip (the television will show settings instead).  The \u201csnowman\u201d mock-up now uses a single colour plastic core with one large rubber key-sheet, backlit buttons, and the company slogan embossed on the side.  Thus, the final specification retains the agreed single-curved form and swap-able cases, while simplifying electronics and finishes to meet price and production constraints.",
    "Huw David saw no inherent \u201chidden trap\u201d in the legislation provided it is introduced sensibly and properly funded.  Asked about possible unintended consequences he replied that, if implementation is \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201cresourced,\u201d he does not expect any; the only danger would be if already-stretched children\u2019s-services budgets were forced to absorb new work without extra money.  For that reason he stressed parallel investment in early-intervention and family-support programmes and a wide public-awareness campaign so that parents understand the change and do not feel criminalised.\n\nTurning to whether the Bill is needed at all, given that most Welsh parents now reject smacking, David argued it is precisely this cultural shift that justifies legislation.  The law should keep pace with society: abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment is, in his words, \u201cthe natural progression\u201d and provides clear, unequivocal protection for children\u2014especially the most vulnerable\u2014who currently cannot know \u201cwhere the line is.\u201d  Clarity, he said, empowers children to speak up and professionals to act.\n\nOn putting such matters on the face of the Bill, David was relaxed about principle but keen on certainty.  Initially he felt Welsh Government\u2019s verbal commitment to a national awareness campaign was sufficient; however, after reflection he \u201cchanged his mind,\u201d saying he would welcome an explicit statutory duty on Ministers to promote the change, ensuring resources are secured and the message reaches every family.  He did not ask for the argument about cultural change itself to be written into the Bill.",
    "The team treated the two-sided concept as an attractive way to satisfy very different users with one product: a \u201cfront\u201d offering only the large channel/volume/mute keys for children, guests or elderly users, and a \u201cback\u201d (revealed by sliding or flipping) that carried the full DVD, tele-text and set-up cluster for power-users.  While everyone liked the idea in theory, several reservations emerged.  The user-interface designer worried that turning the unit over or sliding shells might feel awkward in the hand and could trigger accidental presses; the project-manager added that the mechanism would have to lock firmly so one face was disabled when the other was active.  The industrial designer also noted that the extra hinge or slider would raise tooling costs and might threaten the \u00a312.50 build cap.\n\nDuring the formal evaluation session (1 = \u201ctrue\u201d, 7 = \u201cfalse\u201d) the remote, considered in its two-sided form, averaged 1.88.  It scored well for elegance, ease-of-use and \u201csellable/quirky,\u201d but lost points on \u201ctechnologically innovative\u201d because the group planned to stay with simple infrared and push-buttons.\n\nMarketing felt the dual-face approach broadened the market range: one SKU could be pitched simultaneously to families, the elderly and gadget-buyers, supporting the Christmas impulse-buy target of 25 \u20ac.  Still, a fallback plan\u2014shipping a single-sided \u201cvery good TV-only remote\u201d\u2014was kept on the table if costs ballooned.\n\nRobustness was deemed critical.  Everyone agreed the casing had to survive sofa drops and spills: hard ABS plastic for rigidity wrapped in a thin rubber over-mould for shock-absorption, with rubberised buttons.  A fully water-proof version (for bath use) was discussed, as was bundling a clear splash-cover, but no decision was taken pending cost estimates.",
    "Group 3 focused on what regulation-making powers Ministers should hold once the defence of reasonable punishment is repealed.\n\nDeputy Minister Julie Morgan tabled amendment 3 (with consequential amendments 6, 7 and 8) after deciding the defence should fall automatically two years after Royal Assent rather than by Ministerial Commencement Order.  Because that fixed date removes an order-making power, amendment 3 re-inserts a limited power for Welsh Ministers to make \u201ctransitory, transitional or saving\u201d regulations by statutory instrument, with no Assembly procedure attached.  Morgan stressed that the provision was purely \u201ctechnical\u201d, added no new powers and reflected Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee advice that no Assembly procedure was required.  She said it would simply let Ministers tidy up details, for example where different offences straddle the change in the law.\n\nSuzy Davies accepted the need for a regulation-making power but felt the Deputy Minister\u2019s version was too narrow and provided no legislative scrutiny.  Her probing amendment 3A sought to widen the power so Ministers could make any regulations \u201cneeded for the purposes of section 1\u201d and, crucially, make that power subject to Assembly procedure.  Davies argued that implementing awareness-raising duties or post-implementation reporting might require regulations beyond \u201ctransitory\u201d matters, and the Senedd should have a clear opportunity to examine them.  \u201cOne person\u2019s \u2018technical\u2019 change,\u201d she warned, \u201cis another person\u2019s essential scrutiny.\u201d\n\nMorgan replied that broader powers were unnecessary but promised to \u201ckeep the matter under review\u201d and discuss options with Davies before Stage 3.  Members then rejected amendment 3A and approved amendment 3, leaving Ministers with the limited, non-procedure power set out by the Government.",
    "Brexit already constrains Welsh universities\u2019 fee and access plans.  EU-resident enrolment \u2013 on which many plans assume full-fee income \u2013 is down about 8 %, and non-EU applications have also fallen.  If this trend persists institutions will collect less tuition, reducing the funds they had earmarked in their fee-and-access plans for widening participation, mobility and support activity.  HEFCW therefore requires every university to run multiple Brexit scenarios, resubmit plans if assumptions change materially and explain any post-event variances.  Finance teams model four-year cash-flows, stress\u2013test EU research, structural-fund and student-recruitment losses, and report to HEFCW twice a year.  To shield students, governing bodies must maintain student-protection plans and charters, guarantee course completion, and build emergency reserves.  HEFCW, the Welsh Government Brexit Working Group and Universities Wales share intelligence on immigration, Erasmus replacement schemes and research access, while the new \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d campaign and enhanced risk monitoring aim to keep Wales attractive and to spot emerging problems early.\n\nIn Ottawa, MPs pressed Public Services Minister Anita Anand to back Canadian production of personal protective equipment.  Questions highlighted Medicom\u2019s Montr\u00e9al N-95 line, General Motors\u2019 mask line, and B.C.\u2019s Novo Textiles, already shipping surgical masks and preparing to make N-95s.  Members asked why some foreign contracts were cancelled for failing Canadian standards and urged priority for domestic suppliers.  Anand replied that 101 million surgical masks have arrived, 24 contracts are with Canadian firms, and safety \u2013 not nationality \u2013 determines purchasing.\n\nOn stalled provincial infrastructure files, Conservative MP Luc Berthold asked Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna how many projects still await federal sign-off, warning that a short construction season could be lost.  McKenna would not give a figure, saying only that \u201chundreds\u201d have been approved in recent weeks and that talks with provinces continue; opposition members maintained that many applications remain on her desk.",
    "The transcripts highlight two separate but parallel themes.\n\n1.  The \u201cmiddle tier\u201d in Welsh education  \n\u2022  It comprises local authorities, the four regional school-improvement consortia, Estyn and Welsh Government officials.  \n\u2022  Its core purpose is to provide consistent, evidence-based support and challenge to schools, especially through robust self-evaluation, early-warning \u201ctriage\u201d of schools in difficulty and coordinated intervention.  \n\u2022  Performance is uneven: some consortia are judged effective by Estyn, others (notably ERW) need reform.  The Minister ruled out abolishing the tier, arguing that 22 individual authorities lack the scale to deliver improvement, but she expects greater consistency and pooled services (e.g., HR, governor support).  \n\u2022  A strategic delivery group, chaired by Prof. Dylan Jones, is mapping roles, removing duplication and strengthening \u201ccollective efficacy\u201d ahead of curriculum rollout; OECD findings next month will feed into further adjustments.  Although cooperation is increasing, the group is not designing a single national agency \u2013 regional delivery with shared national principles remains the goal.\n\n2.  Federal support for elderly and other vulnerable Canadians during COVID-19  \n\u2022  Seniors will receive a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 to all OAS recipients plus $200 to those on the Guaranteed Income Supplement (up to $500 for the poorest), on top of the earlier GST credit top-up averaging $375\u2013$510 per household.  \n\u2022  The New Horizons for Seniors Program has been expanded by $20 million so charities can fund grocery delivery, social-connection technology and other practical help.  \n\u2022  Ottawa transferred hundreds of millions of dollars to provinces, municipalities and shelters to allow physical distancing, rent extra space and purchase PPE for the homeless.  \n\u2022  The Health Minister acknowledged the crisis in long-term-care homes; the federal government will work with provinces on stronger, enforceable national standards to ensure safe, dignified elder care and to stabilize staffing, while respecting provincial jurisdiction.\n\nTogether, the meetings stress coordinated, multi-level action: in Wales, to raise school standards through a clearer, better-aligned middle tier; in Canada, to cushion seniors and other at-risk groups and to fix systemic gaps exposed by the pandemic.",
    "The marketing specialist consistently evaluates the project through the lens of differentiation, personal appeal, and long-term customer value.  On user identification, she champions adding speech-recognition so the handset \u201cknows who is using it.\u201d  A speaker-dependent system, she argues, could:  \n\u2022 let the device greet individual family members, recall each person\u2019s favourite channels and volume levels, and streamline navigation;  \n\u2022 allow parents to bar younger users from certain functions; and  \n\u2022 double as a voice-activated \u201clocator,\u201d eliminating the old clap-to-find trick.  \n\nShe acknowledges that true speaker-independent recognition would inflate costs, so her compromise is a modest speaker-dependent module that adds roughly \u20ac5 while still giving a compelling \u201cwow\u201d factor and a distinctive sales pitch.\n\nRegarding the product as a whole, her perspective is unmistakably premium.  She praises the current prototype\u2014scroll wheel, cradle, beep-to-find, rugged shell\u2014as \u201cmore than I was asking for,\u201d and recommends positioning it at \u20ac35\u201350 rather than chasing a \u20ac25 mass-market slot.  In her view, customers pay for exclusivity, lifetime replacement, and upgrade potential.  She therefore requests:  \n\u2022 a lifetime \u201cnormal-use\u201d guarantee to underscore durability;  \n\u2022 the possibility of hardware or card-based upgrades so early buyers feel protected against obsolescence; and  \n\u2022 finishes that match high-end TVs (silver, black) while still nodding to emerging trends\u2014fruit-coloured or \u201cspongy\u201d rubber skins that help owners \u201cidentify with\u201d the product and show it off.\n\nSummed up, the marketer wants the remote to be a personal, trend-aware status item: instantly recognisable, voice-aware, future-proof and priced to signal quality rather than commodity.",
    "In evidence the Minister and officials said the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 is now applied by every publicly funded university, but \u201cuniversal adoption\u201d has exposed both strengths and gaps they want to address through the forthcoming Post-compulsory Education and Training (PCET) Bill.  \n\nAdvantages identified  \n\u2022 Clear statutory framework for regulating Welsh universities and linking fee-limit powers to access duties.  \n\u2022 Protection of institutional autonomy; the Act contains \u201cnumerous provisions that safeguard universities\u2019 privileges\u201d, something the Minister intends to carry forward.  \n\u2022 New intervention powers for HEFCW \u2013 fee and access plan approval, financial management code, and sanctions that can ultimately be enforced by injunction. These give Wales leverage despite the shift to loan-based student finance.  \n\u2022 An explicit focus on the four original policy goals: regulation, public benefit from Welsh-Government funding, widening access, and autonomy. The Minister believes these goals remain valid.\n\nWeaknesses or limits  \n\u2022 Powers can be \u201ccumbersome, inflexible and threatening\u201d; HEFCW say the escalation route jumps from informal chats to very harsh sanctions with little in between, making swift preventative action hard.  \n\u2022 Act is framed so tightly around autonomy that it cannot compel institutions to meet national outcomes; Government has had to rely on annual remit letters or ad-hoc conditions instead.  \n\u2022 Fee and access plans are input-heavy, bureaucratic and evaluated slowly; they do not promote collaboration and may divert effort from outcomes.  \n\u2022 Private/alternative providers are largely outside the regime because institutions must be charities; only six such providers can be regulated case-by-case, leaving students exposed.  \n\u2022 No power to regulate postgraduate or part-time fee levels and no single quality-assurance system across HE and FE.  \n\nTo retain the advantages but remedy the weaknesses, the new PCET Bill will introduce outcome agreements, a broader regulatory commission, a more graduated toolkit of sanctions, strengthened governance and quality provisions, and a mechanism to bring private providers and cross-sector collaboration within scope.",
    "Cat opened the session by unveiling a one\u2013page evaluation matrix she had distilled from all previous user- and market requirements.  Every potential feature of the remote would be judged on a 1-to-7 Likert scale (1 = \u201cfully meets the requirement\u201d, 7 = \u201cdoes not meet\u201d).  The criteria were grouped but effectively covered:  \n\n\u2022 Aesthetics/fashion appeal ( \u201cfruit & veg\u201d look, colour options, overall form)  \n\u2022 Core functionality (channel/volume access, on/off, tele-text, favourite channels)  \n\u2022 Ease of use and learnability (intuitive layout, number of buttons, menu depth)  \n\u2022 Ergonomics and RSI risk (one-hand operation, right- vs left-hand bias, weight)  \n\u2022 Technological novelty (scroll wheel, kinetic or solar power, locator beeper)  \n\u2022 Losing-prevention and robustness (spongy latex skin, bright colours, locator)  \n\u2022 Simplicity and manufacturability (component count, cost, compatibility).  \n\nThe team then \u201cwalked\u201d their preferred prototype\u2014the curved yellow \u201cpotato/banana\u201d remote\u2014through the list, calling out scores while Marketing logged them and Project Management checked finance constraints.  Highlights of the debate:\n\n\u2022 Aesthetics and \u201csponginess\u201d received 1s and 2s; everyone felt the fruity shape and latex skin were on-brand and eye-catching.  \n\u2022 Functionality averaged around 5; members worried about the absence of dedicated number keys and a conventional 3\u00d73 keypad.  \n\u2022 Ease of use split the group: the scroll wheel and single menu button were seen as elegant by some (scores of 2\u20133) but potentially confusing for first-time users (scores of 5\u20136).  \n\u2022 Ergonomics got dinged (5\u20136) for favouring right-handers; a mirror-image version was suggested.  \n\u2022 The locator idea and the kinetic battery were praised for innovation yet flagged as costly; a simpler beeper and charging base were proposed.  \n\nWhen totals were averaged the concept sat just under \u201cacceptable\u201d (roughly mid-5s).  The exercise pinpointed three action items: refine left-hand ergonomics, rethink keypad clarity, and trim high-price components before the final finance check.",
    "CDs for backup:  Participants liked the idea of moving seldom-used meeting audio off the main file-server, but confidence in CD/DVD media was low.  They noted that pressed, commercial CDs last \u201cquite a while,\u201d yet recordable discs often lose data after only one-to-three years; several people have already seen failures.  Re-burning the collection every year was judged impractical, and relying on CDs alone felt risky.  The consensus drifted toward keeping master copies on inexpensive, non-backed-up disks and making one-time tape archives; CDs could be an optional, secondary distribution format but not the primary safeguard.\n\nProbability computation:  To decide intentions such as Enter, View or Approach, the group must combine four information sources\u2014user, situation, discourse and ontology\u2014without creating an unmanageably large conditional-probability table.  They proposed treating each source as an \u201cexpert.\u201d  The simplest rule averages the experts\u2019 votes (e.g., two vote \u201cApproach,\u201d one \u201cView,\u201d one \u201cEnter\u201d gives 0.50, 0.25, 0.25).  Because some experts may be more reliable, weights w1\u2026wn can replace equal votes.  For situations where reliability itself varies, a \u201cmixture-of-experts\u201d was outlined: a hidden node H, conditioned on the same inputs, selects which expert (or weighting vector) to trust on that case.  This keeps the network acyclic, limits table size, and can be implemented in JavaBayes or a similar package; the weights could later be learned from annotated dialogue.\n\nComputer navigation experiment:  In the SmartKom Wizard-of-Oz study a tourist sitter views a 2-D/3-D map of Heidelberg, rings a \u201cperfect\u201d phone service and completes tasks like \u201cbuy stamps,\u201d \u201csee the Powder Tower,\u201d or \u201ctake a picture.\u201d  Midway the simulated system \u201ccrashes,\u201d forcing a switch from synthesized to human dialogue, so both human-computer and human-human speech are captured.  The room carries close-talk and table microphones synchronized with far-field mics, giving clean ground truth and challenging acoustics simultaneously.  GPS position is assumed; objects are classified into Vista, Enter or Tango targets; all channels are logged for eventual public release.",
    "The group briefly explored giving the remote two identical sets of side-keys\u2014one on the left edge and one on the right\u2014so that any user could reach channel and volume controls with the thumb that happened to be upper-most. They abandoned the idea almost immediately. Both the user-interface specialist and the Project Manager warned that doubling controls would clutter the casing, force elderly users to \u201chunt\u201d for the right buttons, and therefore \u201cmake ease-of-use a lot more difficult.\u201d Because simplicity for 60- to 80-year-olds was a non-negotiable requirement, the team opted for a single, clearly placed rocker on the right flank where a typical (right-hand) thumb naturally rests.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager spotted a different ergonomic issue: the rubber, finger-trigger design clearly favoured the right hand. He asked whether they should produce separate right- and left-handed versions. The suggestion received only mild support. The UI designer joked that \u201cif we build rocket ships why can\u2019t we build left-handed remotes,\u201d but marketing and the industrial designer pointed out that most left-handers already use right-oriented computer mice and would adapt easily. Making two molds would raise cost without adding much value. When the team later rated the concept, they marked it \u201cmore geared for right-handed people\u201d but still accepted it. In short, the dual-version proposal was acknowledged yet judged unnecessary; the final plan remains a single, right-hand-optimized remote.",
    "The team\u2019s main financial constraint was a strict production-cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50.  Early calculations showed the remote control was \u201cway above\u201d that figure, so the group systematically examined which elements could be sacrificed without destroying the concept.\n\n1. Highest-cost cuts  \n   \u2022 Solar cells were dropped first; the saving immediately brought the estimate down several eurocents.  \n   \u2022 Speech/voice-recognition was judged attractive to power-users but technically complex, hard to learn, and far too expensive.  Eliminating it became the cornerstone of the new cost plan.  \n   \u2022 The double-curved, titanium or coloured \u201cbanana\u201d housing was also abandoned; those materials or shapes either conflicted with solar power or added tooling cost.\n\n2. Materials trade-offs  \n   \u2022 Replacing rubber buttons and casing with cheaper plastic was proposed.  However, marketing data showed customers liked the \u201cspongy\u201d rubber feel and perceived it as durable and distinctive.  The compromise was to keep a basic rubber, curved shell in black/grey and sell interchangeable coloured covers separately; this retained tactile appeal while shifting fashion costs to optional accessories.  \n   \u2022 Plastic push-buttons and a simplified, single-colour mould further trimmed cents.\n\n3. Features retained vs. removed  \n   \u2022 An LCD screen survived the cut: the group felt it delivered clearer menus and could even replace several hard keys, making it \u201cworth more than speech recognition.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Only four essential hard buttons (teletext, OK, favourite, mute) remained.  Everything else moved under the LCD menu tree.\n\n4. Final outcome  \n   By deleting solar cells, voice recognition and special colours, and by standardising the casing while offering optional covers, the projected unit cost fell to roughly \u20ac12.40\u2014just under the target.  The team accepted some loss of \u201cfanciness,\u201d but concluded the pared-down product meets core user needs and keeps profitability intact.",
    "During the discussion the team weighed several advantages and drawbacks of adding voice-recognition to the new remote.\n\nPros  \n\u2022 Strong market appeal: Survey data showed a \u201cvery high\u201d willingness to pay extra for intuitive features such as voice control, especially among the chosen 15-35 \u201cyoung-professional\u201d segment. Voice input therefore offers a clear selling point and fits the firm\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d image.  \n\u2022 Differentiation & publicity: Being able to advertise speech control would set the product apart in a crowded mid-price market and satisfy management\u2019s desire for a distinctive feature.  \n\u2022 Accessibility: Voice commands could make the remote easier for users with physical disabilities, broadening the potential customer base.  \n\u2022 Optional convenience: If implemented as an on/off mode, speech could supplement (not replace) buttons, giving tech-savvy owners faster one-shot commands while letting others ignore it.\n\nCons  \n\u2022 Immature accuracy: The UI designer reported current consumer implementations \u201caren\u2019t particularly amazing,\u201d often forcing users to shout repeatedly. Poor performance could frustrate buyers and damage brand image.  \n\u2022 Cost & complexity: Microphones, DSP chips and additional logic would raise component cost, shorten battery life and possibly require a rechargeable solution \u2013 all contrary to the brief to stay simple and reach market quickly.  \n\u2022 Time-to-market risk: Extra hardware, coding and testing could delay launch, conflicting with management\u2019s warning against over-complexity.  \n\u2022 Ergonomic conflicts: Users tend to lift the remote toward their mouth when speaking, which may block the infrared beam; solving this could demand alternative transmitters or redesigned housings.  \n\u2022 Demographic limits: While popular with 15-35s, voice control tested poorly with older groups, so the feature might add expense without universal take-up.\n\nThe group therefore saw voice recognition as a high-profile but risky enhancement that should remain optional and subject to further feasibility and cost analysis.",
    "Battery selection was driven by three overall requirements the Industrial Designer kept repeating: the pack had to last a long time, occupy little space so the handset could be slim, and demand as little user-maintenance as possible.\n\nHe first reviewed the usual alkaline choices.  \n\u2022 AA cells are easy to find and cheap, but their diameter forces a \u201cchunky\u201d housing that clashes with the curved, fashion-led form factor the team wants.  \n\u2022 AAA cells let the enclosure be thinner, yet still \u201clook bulky\u201d once you stack two of them and they have to be replaced every few months.  \n\nSmall coin-type lithium cells were raised, but capacity is low and they are unfamiliar to many users. To lengthen run-time he proposed automatically dimming keypad back-lights and putting the electronics into a deep-sleep mode between key-presses.\n\nWhen the group asked for still smaller, lower-maintenance solutions, he presented four rechargeables:  \n1. Phone-style Li-ion plus a drop-in charger cradle,  \n2. Solar trickle-charge,  \n3. Dynamo \u201cwind-up,\u201d and  \n4. Kinetic (watch) charging.\n\nSolar was ruled out because most people watch TV at night; dynamo added bulk; Li-ion required a custom pack and raised cost. The kinetic system, paired with a tiny watch cell, satisfied his earlier size and lifetime targets and costs less than a bespoke Li-ion. The team therefore agreed on \u201ckinetic charging with a watch-type battery\u201d and abandoned AA/AAA altogether.\n\nFor the industrial working prototype he finally recommended including a charger (cradle rather than loose batteries). A dock keeps the remote in one known place (doubling as the \u201clost-remote\u201d locator), ensures it leaves the line no time for the cell to drain, and eliminates user complaints about buying or disposing of batteries\u2014exactly the kind of durability and low servicing burden industry buyers expect.",
    "The team decided to fold the project into a conference submission for several pragmatic and strategic reasons that surfaced during the meetings.\n\nFirst, writing the paper is a low-risk way to discover whether their recent work \u201creally is a paper,\u201d as Nancy reminded them; actually drafting it forces them to articulate the contribution and exposes gaps before outside reviewers do. Even a rejection would still leave them with a concise, citable document that records the last six months of progress\u2014\u201cthere\u2019s never a bad idea to document things.\u201d\n\nSecond, the target conference (on neurally-, cognitively- and linguistically-motivated language architectures, held in Saarbr\u00fccken) is a natural venue. Its interdisciplinary focus matches their Bayes-net-based interpretation/generation scheme, their construction-grammar formalism, and the cognitive motivations they want to highlight. Presenting there would let them float their \u201cweird\u201d self-dialoguing-system idea and the new SUDO-square formalism before exactly the sort of mixed CS-linguistics audience that can critique both the engineering and the cognitive plausibility.\n\nThird, the paper offers a timely milestone for internal coordination. A short (\u2248 4-page) submission deadline gives the group a concrete date to finish the generation XML, tidy the ontology/discourse interface, and run the first full Bayes-net experiments that everyone is curious about. Drafting together also lets them consolidate feedback from Jerry and the visiting German project manager.\n\nFinally, a successful submission would justify travel funding: several members are already scheduled to be in Germany in late September, so presenting the paper would dovetail with those trips.\n\nIn sum, documenting progress, testing ideas, synchronizing development, obtaining expert feedback, and creating a travel-worthy result all motivated including the project in a conference paper.",
    "\u2022 Funding for the regional consortia  \nKirsty Williams described the extra \u00a310 million released this year to further-education colleges as a clear signal that Welsh Government now expects the three Regional Skills Partnerships/ consortia to drive post-16 course planning.  Colleges must show that new or expanded programmes match the priorities identified by the consortia before the money is released.  She added that the same \u201cchallenge-and-support\u201d model is being applied to schools through the consortia\u2019s professional-learning budgets, but stressed that allocation decisions remain for local leaders, not Ministers.\n\n\u2022 University governance  \nAsked about high-profile difficulties at Swansea and Trinity St David, the Cabinet Secretary accepted that \u201cgovernance has moved centre-stage\u201d.  She now meets vice-chancellors and \u2013 crucially \u2013 governing-body chairs separately and has backed a joint Universities Wales / HEFCW independent review chaired by Gillian Camm.  Williams wants more diversity, student and staff voice and greater transparency over senior pay; she is exploring a statutory \u201cgood-governance condition\u201d that could be written into the forthcoming PCET Bill so the new commission can intervene before problems escalate.\n\n\u2022 University mergers  \nWilliams said Government has \u201cno policy to pursue mergers\u201d.  Her only test is whether a proposal enhances student experience and long-term sustainability.  Mergers are therefore a matter for autonomous institutions, though HEFCW is examining lessons from past restructurings.  She emphasised that collaboration, not forced consolidation, is the policy priority.\n\n\u2022 Admissions problems and proposed remedies  \nMembers raised falling EU applications and inconsistent Russell-Group recognition of the Welsh Baccalaureate.  Williams linked the EU fall to the loss of the tuition-fee grant but rejected claims that Welsh entrants are disadvantaged: most UK universities either accept the graded Skills Challenge Certificate as a full A-level or lower offers when it is presented.  To strengthen recruitment she highlighted:  \n  \u2013 the \u00a33.5 million \u201cGlobal Wales\u201d marketing fund drawn from the EU Transition pot;  \n  \u2013 additional \u00a36.4 million (2017-18) and \u00a35 million (2018-19) HEFCW grants to cushion demographic and Brexit pressures;  \n  \u2013 a joint Welsh-sector campaign on Erasmus+, Horizon and post-study work;  \n  \u2013 outcome-agreements and revised fee-and-access plans to push widening-access and international enrolment targets.  \nOverall she argued that a coherent marketing push, clearer immigration rules and continued Diamond-based support will reverse recent admission problems.",
    "The team first tackled the power question.  They compared standard AAA cells, a lithium-ion pack with a charging cradle, solar panels, a hand-crank dynamo and a \u201cshake-to-charge\u201d kinetic module.  Because the remote had to stay small, avoid an external base and still project a high-tech image, they finally dropped both the cradle and conventional batteries and chose the kinetic generator.  This removed replacement-battery hassle, kept weight down and, in their cost spreadsheet, still fit the \u20ac12.50 production ceiling.\n\nFor technological differentiation they reviewed several ideas\u2014full voice command, fruit-print casings, scroll wheels, illuminated keys and interchangeable covers.  Voice control for channel changing was judged too complex and expensive, but a limited voice (or whistle) locator chip was retained so users can find the remote when it\u2019s lost.  Additional \u201cnewness\u201d comes from the kinetic power system, side-mounted scroll/volume rockers, a four-way central pad, an automatic full-body back-light and swappable latex skins that can follow yearly fashion trends.  The final form is a single-curve, gun-metal plastic shell with optional coloured overlays.\n\nUsing a seven-point evaluation grid (1 = completely meets the goal), the prototype scored 2 on ease of use, 2 on fashion appeal, 1\u20132 on ergonomics/\u201cfeel good,\u201d and 3\u20134 on technological innovation (reflecting the absence of full voice command).  Trend relevance and \u201chard to lose\u201d both landed around 2\u20133.  Manufacturing costs stayed under target, so the spreadsheet showed healthy margins.  Overall, the group pronounced the remote \u201ca winner\u201d\u2014distinctive, affordable, comfortable, and sufficiently innovative\u2014and closed the meeting satisfied with both the process and the result.",
    "\u2022 Technical issues \u2013 The team repeatedly weighed functionality against cost and reliability.  They agreed to keep the proven infrared transmission system and to avoid expensive \u201cchip-on-print\u201d circuitry, LCD displays, spinning wheels and full speech-recognition.  Instead they will use simple rubber buttons mounted on a low-cost board, possibly adding inexpensive LEDs for \u201cfind-me\u201d lighting or a beeper activated by sound.  Tele-text support, multi-device control and Bluetooth were all rejected as either obsolete, too complex or requiring compatible televisions.\n\n\u2022 Energy source \u2013 Four alternatives were tabled: standard batteries, a hand-crank dynamo, solar cells and kinetic harvesting.  Solar was judged unreliable indoors, and the dynamo felt old-fashioned.  The group finally backed a kinetic solution: the soft rubber housing can be squeezed or tossed, generating enough charge to top-up an internal rechargeable cell.  This complements their \u201canti-RSI, spongy rubber\u201d concept while removing the cost of frequent battery replacement.  A cheap charging cradle or hybrid solar panel may be revisited later if the budget allows.\n\n\u2022 Project-announcement e-mail \u2013 At the close of the first session the project manager promised a clarifying e-mail that would list individual responsibilities (industrial design, user-interface, marketing), outline the upcoming functional-design phase and confirm the next meeting time.  He stressed that anyone unsure of their task would \u201csoon get an e-mail about it,\u201d turning the message into the formal kick-off announcement for the wider team.\n\n\u2022 Sample sensor \u2013 Marketing queried whether the newly developed \u201csample sensor / sample speaker\u201d (a programmable voice-playback unit used in the company\u2019s coffee machine) could differentiate the product.  After brief debate the UI and technical members ruled it out: it offered no real control benefit, added significant cost and duplicated the still-immature voice-recognition option.  The remote will therefore exclude the sample sensor.",
    "In the final meeting the team focused on two areas: confirming the product concept and resolving outstanding problems.\n\nDesign recap\n\u2022 Prototype shown: rubber-coated, single-curve remote with a soft \u201cspongy\u201d feel, basic power/volume/channel buttons on the surface and a slide-out panel for advanced functions.  \n\u2022 Core differentiator: on-board voice-recognition module housed at the back; coloured light feedback can be switched off if users find it distracting.  \n\u2022 Optional \u201cskins\u201d were discussed; the base unit would ship in a subdued colour but alternate covers could be added easily at the factory.  \n\u2022 Cost estimate for the current build is \u20ac11.99, comfortably below the original \u20ac12.50 target once standard rubber buttons replaced costlier scroll wheels.\n\nProblems reviewed\n1. Budget over-run triggered by the solar-cell / back-up battery combination. After recalculating, the team agreed to drop the solar panel and rely on standard power, accepting that \u201ceco\u201d positioning would be deferred to a later revision.  \n2. Marketing emphasis: consensus that voice recognition\u2014not environmental credentials\u2014should be the primary selling point; team will highlight ease of use for younger \u201ctech\u201d consumers.  \n3. Learning curve: the pull-out panel may confuse first-time users, but tests show it \u201cmakes sense\u201d after brief practice; no redesign required.  \n4. Material and colour range: Play-Doh prototype showed limited colour options; industrial designer requested more choices for production samples.  \n5. Team process: members felt creative freedom was high, but noted less information flow toward the end of the project and some reluctance to use room equipment (whiteboard, pens) because of microphone wiring.\n\nAction items\n\u2022 Project Manager to update final cost sheet, remove solar cell line, and file overall evaluation report.  \n\u2022 Marketing to draft messaging centred on voice recognition and ergonomic comfort.  \n\u2022 UID and ID to prepare additional colour/skin proposals before hand-off to manufacturing.",
    "Hefin David AM expressed three linked worries.  \nFirst, current fee and access plans are \u201cbureaucratic, process-driven and still under evaluation\u201d.  Their annual cycle and input-based metrics make it hard to judge impact, so institutions and HEFCW \u201chave no confidence\u201d in them.  He urged a longer-term, outcome-focused model and asked that any new system avoid the same paperwork burden.  \n\nSecond, he questioned whether a flat \u00a34.50 childcare rate can work everywhere.  Cardiff and Newport, where rents and wages are higher, have yet to pilot the offer; David fears providers there may be unable to cover costs or may introduce optional extras\u2014food, trips, nappies\u2014of up to \u00a37.50 a day.  Those surcharges, he warned, would fall hardest on \u201cthe lowest-income working families\u201d the policy is meant to help.  He asked the Minister to model different rates or an upper-income cap to prevent wealthier parents buying superior provision while poorer parents go without.  \n\nThird, he highlighted capacity and quality.  Wales already has \u201cthe most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain\u201d; rapid expansion risks shortages of qualified Welsh-medium and special-needs staff.  David pressed for evidence that a sufficiently trained workforce can be in place by 2020.\n\nHuw Irranca-Davies acknowledged the concerns.  He agreed the administrative load of fee/access plans and of manually checking childcare eligibility is \u201cheavy\u201d and said outcome agreements and an HMRC-style central portal should replace current systems.  On affordability he promised to test the \u00a34.50 rate in high-cost Cardiff and Newport pilots; if it proves unsustainable, differential rates or other adjustments will be considered.  He cited the \u00a360 m capital fund and a 10-year workforce strategy to raise qualifications and Welsh-medium capacity, but accepted the sector\u2019s resilience and pay levels must be kept under review as the offer scales up.",
    "PhD-C devoted most of the meeting to on-line mean/variance normalisation.  He now estimates two running means\u2014one for speech frames and one for silence\u2014driven by the VAD posterior, and he shortens the time constant at the start of an utterance so the speech mean converges quickly, then lengthens it to keep tracking slowly.  Experiments showed almost no WER gain; in particular the C1 coefficient still drifts when background noise changes.  He therefore questioned whether per-coefficient tuning or different time-constants for C0 and the higher MFCCs might help.  Prof B liked the engineering but asked him to look at \u201cwhat kinds of errors change\u201d, e.g. insertions vs. deletions or quiet vs. noisy speech, before abandoning the idea; subtle gains may be hidden by gross averages.\n\nPhase normalisation was reported by PhD-F/Grad-G, not by PhD-C.  Long-term phase-mean subtraction produced \u201cgarbage\u201d recognition, and un-wrapping the phase in Matlab actually made things worse.  Despite this, PhD-F is still exploring phase work in the complex domain.  Prof B does not regard the negative results as final; he suggested staying in the complex plane, dividing the spectrum by its average complex value instead of converting to magnitude/phase, and warned that the Taylor-series log expansion requires careful scaling.  In short, current phase-normalisation trials fail, but both Prof B and the group think alternative formulations are worth a limited follow-up.\n\nOn qualifying exams, only a brief status check occurred: Barry said he is preparing cheating experiments for his July quals.  Neither PhD-C nor Prof B offered opinions beyond tacit approval to \u201ckeep working on it,\u201d so quals remained a housekeeping note rather than a discussion topic.",
    "The meetings converged on a three-part strategy for exploiting \u201chigh-level\u201d linguistic cues.\n\n1. Detecting the features themselves  \nParticipants want recognisers that fire on a small set of linguistically meaningful, binary variables\u2014e.g. sonorant/obstruent, nasality, voicing, landmarkhood.  Phone labels from TIMIT or sensor-based articulatory databases can serve as initial targets, but the goal is to learn better mappings from data.  Larry Saul\u2019s sonorant detector was held up as a model: every acoustic band delivers a soft detector; within a band their outputs are combined by a soft AND, while the bands are merged by an OR.  Training treats the band-specific \u201cis-sonorant\u201d decisions as hidden variables, estimated with EM, so that noisy bands can be ignored automatically.  The same idea applies to other feature streams generated from TRAPS, LDA-filtered cepstra, low-pass versions, or silence detectors: each stream supplies its own evidence instead of forcing one monolithic front end.\n\n2. Combining the parallel streams  \nFull conditional probability tables for N cues explode exponentially.  To avoid that, the group will encode the fusion node with a Noisy-OR (or related \u201csoft evidence\u201d function).  A Noisy-OR needs only 3\u00b72^N parameters, is easily hand-initialised, copes gracefully with missing cues, and mirrors neural evidence accumulation.  JavaBayes can implement it by replacing the large CPT with a deterministic G( E\u2081\u2026E_N ) function or by expanding the table automatically.\n\n3. Recording the features in the transcripts  \nJane\u2019s transcription formalisation now marks non-lexical events, acronyms, discourse qualifiers and spoken forms with explicit tags (VOC, NVOC, QUAL, GLOSS, NUMS, etc.).  Those tags map directly onto the binary variables the detectors will learn, and can be referenced from the ontology that stores per-object EVA (Enter\u2013View\u2013Approach) vectors.  Because the master transcript is converted to recogniser or discourse versions by scripts, any future change to tags propagates automatically, keeping acoustic training data, Bayesian feature nets and higher-level linguistic analyses in step.",
    "During several agenda reviews the group clarified how the \u201csystem\u2019\u2019 should figure in forthcoming demonstrations, how data and backups will be handled, how written notes might be captured, the relation to Switchboard data, and how meetings themselves will be scheduled.\n\nSystem/demos  \n\u2022 The July demo must run from a Windows laptop.  Key pieces are the Transcriber-based display (waveform plus an added prosody window), the THISL search front-end that lets users type keywords and hear the corresponding speech segment, and illustrative prosody screens (sentence/turn boundaries, laughter, etc.).  All code should be frozen by month-end so it can be ported and tested on the demo laptop the following week.  \n\nBack-ups and disk space  \n\u2022 Uncompressed meetings now consume 30\u201340 GB and scratch disks are \u201c95 % full.\u2019\u2019  \n\u2022 Rather than move material to un-backed-up space, Dave Johnson advised buying another set of large disks, leaving all Meeting Recorder data in the normal backed-up pool, and also keeping periodic NW-archive copies.  Graduate students will meet with Dave to decide how many new disks and where to mount them.\n\nCollecting notes  \n\u2022 The CrossPad pens, originally meant to time-stamp hand-written notes, have seen little use because synchronizing clocks, downloading data and converting formats add overhead.  Alternatives raised: keep one CrossPad for experiments, or switch to wireless PDAs with on-line \u201cmarker\u2019\u2019 buttons that log time codes directly to the server.  No decision was taken; a volunteer project was suggested.\n\nSwitchboard overlap comparison  \n\u2022 The professor reminded the team not to treat heavy overlap as unique to multiparty meetings; two-party Switchboard conversations show many back-channel overlaps as well.  Quantifying \u201cextra\u2019\u2019 overlap caused by additional participants remains an open research goal.\n\nScheduling meetings going forward  \nProfessor B favors alternating emphases: one week on Meeting-Recorder (data, annotation, storage), the next on recognition/algorithmic issues.  If topics dry up the alternating pattern can be relaxed, and frequency can expand again when needed.  He will consult Liz and Jane but sees flexible, focus-based scheduling as the best way to keep discussions lively and productive.",
    "The Welsh Government has abandoned plans to use HMRC\u2019s \u201cchild-care service\u201d to run applications and eligibility checks for the Childcare Offer.  Julie Morgan told the committee that, during the joint discovery phase, three problems became clear.  \n\nFirst, flexibility: HMRC\u2019s rigid IT platform mirrors the English scheme and cannot accommodate Welsh priorities such as adding parents in education or training, supporting people \u201con the cusp\u201d of work, or handling families with \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d.  Any future policy change would have required a complex, UK-wide system rewrite, severely limiting Welsh ministers\u2019 room to expand or adapt the Offer.  \n\nSecond, language compliance: although HMRC can operate bilingually under its Welsh Language Scheme, officials concluded it could not meet the stricter Welsh-language Standards that bind Welsh Ministers.  Technical obstacles (e.g. special characters in multiple linked IT systems) risked non-compliance.  Morgan stressed this was \u201cnot the main driver\u201d but contributed to the decision.  \n\nThird, cost and value for money: the price HMRC quoted at the end of discovery was \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than the figure given to the committee during the Bill stage.  Julie Morgan, Jo-Anne Daniels and Nicola Edwards said a locally administered model would be cheaper, keep expenditure in Wales and exploit councils\u2019 existing links with families.  Ten lead authorities already receive about \u00a32.5 million to run the interim system; detailed work on a national, web-based application run by councils is now under way and is expected to cost less than HMRC\u2019s proposal.  \n\nMorgan acknowledged around \u00a31 million had been spent exploring the HMRC route, but argued the exercise clarified requirements and \u201cshowed us where we need to go\u201d.  Local authorities and the WLGA, she added, now support the Welsh-led model.",
    "Professor C recalled a past Hopkins/Rutgers workshop where all 25 participants simultaneously dispatched jobs to the same 25-machine farm; the contention was so heavy that the shared cluster ran slower than a single desktop.  His comment was a cautionary tale about \u201ceverybody using all the machines at once\u201d and the resulting inefficiency.\n\nRegarding the engineer in Grenada (Jos\u00e9-Carlos Segura), the team\u2019s feedback was encouraging: they may ask him to collaborate and contribute his Vector-Taylor-Series noise-compensation code, but warned that integrating it will force them to \u201cre-check everything else\u201d and re-optimise the rest of the front-end.\n\nFor the new subject-information forms, only three items are now mandatory: Name, E-mail and Time.  The Date is pre-filled by the experimenter, and other lines (native language, region, \u201cprofessional-use-only\u201d notes, etc.) are optional or for staff, but the participant must supply those three core entries.\n\nThe belief-net that Grad B, Grad C and Grad A sketched should have three layers:  \n1) observed feature nodes (verb used, \u201cnice-walls\u201d, time-of-day, admission-fee mention, etc.);  \n2) an intermediate \u201cconcept\u201d layer of hidden variables such as TOUR, ERRAND, IN-A-HURRY that capture the user\u2019s latent goal;  \n3) a top decision node, MODE, whose values are ENTER, VISTA or TANGO.  Additional sub-nodes for user-state, situation and ontology may cluster under the middle layer, but the general idea is a tidy, hierarchical net rather than every feature pointing straight to MODE.\n\nGrad B likes the middle layer but is \u201cbugged\u201d by a total separation between features and the final decision.  He argues some cues (e.g., talking about admission fees) should link directly\u2014either to MODE or to a new node like WANT-TO-ENTER\u2014and suggests adding practical nodes such as HAS-DOOR or PUBLIC-ACCESS.  In short, he supports the hidden-layer scheme yet wants a few direct or auxiliary links to capture very strong lexical clues.",
    "Grad E and Grad A were working toward different aims and therefore judged their experiments by different yard-sticks.  \n\nGrad E\u2019s immediate goal was to decide whether the mean-log-magnitude subtraction scheme could be deployed in an interactive system that can only look into the past.  After replacing the usual 12-second centred window with a 12-second \u201cpast-only\u201d window, Grad E saw only a \u201cpretty tiny\u201d degradation, calling the result \u201cencouraging.\u201d  Subsequent tests in which the models were trained with a 12-second window but the test data were normalised with much shorter windows (2\u20138 s) showed losses of at most about 0.5\u20130.8 % absolute word-error rate.  Grad E concluded that (1) the past-only constraint is acceptable for real-time use, and (2) the system is fairly tolerant to a mismatch between the training and test window lengths; nevertheless, if short windows will be used in practice there is little reason to train with a long one.  Overall, Grad E regarded the outcomes as a positive proof-of-concept and is now considering filter-based implementations and multi-pass decoding to exploit the finding.\n\nGrad A, in contrast, had not yet produced results; the \u201ccheating\u201d experiments were still being set up.  Grad A\u2019s stated objective is to measure the maximum benefit that perfect knowledge of intermediate phonetic categories\u2014starting with voiced vs. unvoiced phones\u2014could bring to recognition accuracy.  By forcibly zeroing the posterior probabilities of phones that violate the known voicing label, Grad A hopes to quantify which cues are worth modelling explicitly.  He characterised the forthcoming runs as a way to learn \u201cwhich of these categories are good,\u201d expected them to be finished before his qualifying exam, and appeared optimistic that the insight would guide future system design.\n\nThus, Grad E saw modest but concrete gains and practicality in his completed tests, whereas Grad A viewed his yet-to-run experiments as an exploratory upper-bound study that should reveal which linguistic cues merit further effort.",
    "User Interface (UI) consistently pushed for an elegant, low-clutter remote. Their main points were:\n\n\u2022 Physical controls should be reduced to the essentials.  Channel and volume can be handled by two scroll wheels; power and a few \u201chidden\u201d set-up keys can sit on the back.  \n\u2022 All other functions appear on a mid-sized LCD touch screen with large icons and very shallow menus so older users are not forced to \u201cdrill down\u201d.  \n\u2022 The body should be an S-shaped, single-curve shell moulded from hard, colour-tinted rubber.  This gives a comfortable grip, survives drops and lets the unit stand upright on its charging dock.  \n\u2022 A small microphone/speaker pair enables speech recognition; this is presented as the product\u2019s signature feature.  \n\u2022 Fruit or autumn colours plus the company logo on the front make the device visually \u201cfashionable\u201d and clearly branded.\n\nWhen the electronics team questioned radio-frequency control, UI argued it was safe: the transmitter can be set to a licence-free band and a built-in identification code prevents a neighbour\u2019s remote from taking over.  They therefore had no functional objections to radio, but were willing to fall back to infra-red if cost dictated.\n\nBudget wise, the prototype cost exceeded the \u20ac12.50 limit.  The project manager suggested flattening the double curve, saving roughly \u20ac2.  UI agreed and added that, if the required savings were achieved, there was \u201cno point spending money for the sake of it\u201d; the only possible use for a surplus would be enlarging the front face to showcase the slogan.\n\nFinal decision: proceed with the single-curve, rubber-cased, LCD-and-scroll-wheel design, keep the speech module, and stay within the reduced manufacturing cost.  Radio control remains under review \u2013 interference is considered solvable, but the team will confirm after a price check before locking the circuitry.",
    "The professor\u2019s comments trace a pragmatic line from low-frequency hums to full-blown additive noise.  \n\u2022 5-Hz Air-conditioner hum: Distant PDA microphones show a huge 5-Hz component that masks the real speech example. He calls it \u201ca bad illustration of reverberation,\u201d but also \u201cnoise we definitely know what to do with.\u201d A simple digital high-pass is enough; replacing the input capacitor is possible but risks new hardware problems.  \n\u2022 High-pass option in their software: The RASTA/PLP front end and Feacalc already contain an optional high-pass whose \u20133 dB point is \u224820 Hz with a mild roll-off up to \u2248100 Hz, so it \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect speech frequencies at all.\u201d When cheap mics are used, he wants this filter invoked before feature extraction.  \n\u2022 Noise addition vs. quantization: Even after 32-bit\u219216-bit conversion, quantization error is \u201cstill not a significant factor\u201d; noise and reverberation dominate.  \n\u2022 FIR/IIR smoothing filters: Existing LDA FIR filters contribute ~200 ms latency. The group redesigned them as IIR (recursive) filters with matched magnitude response, shrinking low-band delay from 200 ms to ~64 ms and high-band to ~11 ms. Phase is \u201calmost linear,\u201d so speech quality should not suffer. Together with cleaner down-/upsampling and on-line mean-variance normalization, overall processing delay should fall below the 250 ms contest limit.  \n\u2022 Dealing with additive noise: Their current system \u201cadamantly\u201d tackles convolutional channel effects (RASTA) and leaves additive noise untreated. He therefore advocates grafting in spectral-subtraction modules like Ericsson\u2019s. Spectral subtraction works best on slowly varying noise; aggressive settings raise variance and cause \u201cmusical noise,\u201d which then clashes with on-line normalization. He suggests multi-stage subtraction or combining noise estimates from VAD-defined nonspeech regions, while keeping latency modest. In short, use mild high-pass filtering for very low-frequency junk, redesign analysis filters to cut delay, and add cautiously tuned spectral subtraction to confront truly additive noise.",
    "The team agreed that the remote\u2019s fundamental \u201cobject\u201d is to be a dedicated TV controller that feels contemporary and easy to hold, yet still covers the essential tasks\u2014power, channel selection, volume, mute and a few submenu items (teletext, picture or audio settings). They want it slim, brightly coloured and usable in one hand, with an optional docking cradle that also stops people losing it.\n\nKinetic self-charging was considered as an energy source (hand-crank or shake-to-charge). Marketing loved the eco angle and the \u201cmy remote is kinetic\u201d brag factor, but the industrial designer warned it would force a thicker, double-curved housing and lift unit cost well above the \u20ac12.50 ceiling. After several cost-cutting passes the project manager said, \u201cCan we just skip the kinetic thing?\u201d\u2014and the group accepted ordinary rechargeable batteries plus a cradle, leaving kinetic power only as a \u201cmaybe later\u201d add-on.\n\nChannel surfing generated a second, longer debate. Replacing conventional up/down buttons with a scroll wheel would let users \u201croll\u201d rapidly through stations; by adding a simple mode switch the wheel could cycle through a personal favourites list (e.g., 1, 5, 38) instead of stepping one channel at a time. Marketing felt this \u201crolling favourites\u201d feature would give the product a clear point of difference in a crowded market. Engineering cautioned that wheels cost more and some televisions change channels too slowly, but agreed to investigate a low-cost, detented wheel and a small LED to show which mode is active. The scroll-wheel/favourites concept stays on the table pending a detailed costed prototype, while kinetic charging has been shelved.",
    "The team intends to market the remote to a clearly defined, style-conscious niche rather than the mass market.  Marketing proposes a \u20ac30-\u20ac50 retail price, a lifetime \u201cnormal-use\u201d guarantee and an \u201cexclusive, not commodity\u201d positioning aimed mainly at 18- to 35-year-olds who buy design-led gadgets.  To let sub-groups identify with the product, the group will offer several interchangeable case colours/skins (wood stain, earth tones, classic silver-black) and highlight eco credentials (solar back-up cell, rubberised recyclable shell).  Feature messages will focus on durability, the \u201cfind-my-remote\u201d locator, and optional voice-recognition for hands-free use.\n\nDuring the appearance design presentations Industrial Design (Nathan) and Marketing reached quick consensus:  \n\u2022 use a double-curved form that looks \u201corganic\u201d and feels good in the hand;  \n\u2022 mould the housing in soft-touch rubber for drop resistance;  \n\u2022 keep the overall size just above an iPod to allow a simple screen or scroll cluster;  \n\u2022 avoid the dated white-plastic look.  \nBoth sides also back producing the same form in several colours so tooling costs stay low while giving demographic variety.\n\nAs part of his own marketing-plan proposal, the Industrial Designer argued that \u201cfashion is the real function\u201d: the remote must be instantly desirable like an iPod regardless of features.  He suggested visible-light signalling as a playful gimmick and recommended releasing several case materials so that if one style fails another can pick up sales.\n\nMarketing\u2019s verdict on the design\u2019s sell-ability is positive: they see the high-end casing plus one \u201chero\u201d function as the hook.  Initially they viewed a touch screen as the headline draw, but after cost reviews declared voice recognition the most marketable differentiator that still fits the budget and exclusivity strategy.",
    "Capturing the subject\u2019s intention  \n\u2022 Grad G kept coming back to this issue.  She liked the new, freer scenario for eliciting speech, but repeatedly asked whether the experimenters would still \u201chave those somewhere what their intention was\u201d so the corpus could be labelled reliably and un-ambiguously.  In short, she approved of the plan provided the intended goal of each dialogue was still recorded.  \n\u2022 The professor (Prof B) also wants the system to recover what the speaker is trying to do, but dislikes calling it \u201cintention.\u201d  He urged the team to speak instead of decision variables or modes and to embed them in a Bayes-net, saying \u201cI don\u2019t like the term either.\u201d  So Grad G stresses keeping the label; the professor stresses how, and what, to call it.\n\nMSG (Modulation-spectrogram) features  \n\u2022 Grad G never expressed a view.  \n\u2022 The professor (Prof D) said he personally \u201creally like[s] MSG,\u201d but for the current deadline it is \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cmight be something we skip in the short term unless you\u2019ve a strong idea of what\u2019s wrong.\u201d  He is positive in principle, cautious in practice.\n\nPronouncing the digit 0  \n\u2022 Grad G said she \u201cnormally say[s] \u2018oh\u2019 \u2019cause it\u2019s easier.\u201d  \n\u2022 The professor remarked that when he gives numbers on the phone he \u201calmost always say[s] \u2018zero.\u2019\u201d  Thus they prefer different pronunciations.\n\nHiring Fey as wizard / recruiter  \n\u2022 Grad G was supportive, volunteering to post the recruitment notice to the Cognitive Science student lists and saying \u201csend it to me.\u201d  She joked happily about the \u201cwizard of Oz\u201d label.  \n\u2022 The professor endorsed the hire enthusiastically: Fey \u201cdid a wonderful job,\u201d \u201csounded fine,\u201d would \u201cbe quite happy to take on that job,\u201d and he asked that paperwork be started to put her on payroll.  Both therefore favor bringing her onto the project, with the professor formally authorising it.",
    "The Industrial Designer consistently urged a \u201ckeep-it-simple\u201d approach.\n\nAppearance design  \nHe favoured a compact, uncluttered look.  In the early discussion he argued against \u201ca big thing full of buttons,\u201d proposing either fewer, larger hard keys for core tasks or a single full-touch screen on which secondary functions could be hidden in sub-menus.  Whichever route was chosen, he wanted the handset to appear sleek and modern so that younger users would find it \u201cfancy\u201d while still being easy for parents to grasp.\n\nSpeech-recognition technology  \nWhen speech control was first raised he called it \u201ca great idea,\u201d but immediately questioned practicality.  He admitted he had \u201cnot thought about it at all\u201d beforehand and doubted it could be built \u201cfor the price we need to hit.\u201d  In short, he liked the concept in principle but felt cost and technical complexity put it outside the current project scope unless later research proved otherwise.\n\nBluetooth and other new transmission technologies  \nAfter dismantling existing remotes he concluded that today\u2019s units are inexpensive because they rely on infrared.  Adding Bluetooth or radio would mean every television also needed a matching receiver, driving consumer cost up.  He therefore recommended staying with infrared and \u201cnot to do Bluetooth or radio waves,\u201d unless Marketing decided to finance a separate Bluetooth receiver in the TV\u2019s placeholder.  Even then he viewed this as \u201crather nice\u201d but secondary; infrared should remain the primary channel.\n\nOverall, his stance was to deliver a visually appealing but straightforward remote for children, avoid expensive novelties, and ensure any advanced feature (like speech or Bluetooth) was only adopted if it could be afforded without compromising simplicity or price.",
    "Throughout the hearings three distinct but related themes emerged.  \n\n1. Priority of inspections  \nJassa Scott (Estyn) and Janet Finch-Saunders AM agreed that rigorous, transparent inspection of the \u201cmiddle tier\u201d--regional school-improvement consortia and local authorities--must be a priority. Scott stressed that many secondary schools in difficulty are in areas where the regional consortium is weak, and that Estyn therefore intends to visit those consortia this spring and survey schools about the support they receive. Finch-Saunders pressed for statutory status and a regular inspection cycle for consortia; Scott replied that, if forthcoming local-government legislation creates statutory \u201ccorporate joint committees\u201d, Estyn should receive explicit powers to inspect them alongside local authorities. Both accepted that robust, routine scrutiny of these bodies is essential to raise standards and to spot failing schools earlier.\n\n2. Re-opening the Commons and Canada\u2019s diplomacy  \nOpposition MPs argued that a full, physically-distanced reopening of the House on 21 September is vital, both to restore normal parliamentary powers (confidence votes, supply days, opposition motions) and to show allies that Canada\u2019s democracy remains vigorous while it presses China on Hong Kong and other issues. Government House Leader Pablo Rodr\u00edguez answered that health restrictions still require a hybrid format; Liberals would \u201creturn to normal as soon as possible\u201d, but only with opposition consent and public-health approval.\n\n3. Allocation of funds & tackling systemic racism  \nAsked about the $14 billion \u201cSafe Restart\u201d envelope and wider anti-racism spending, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said pandemic money must support child-care, testing, PPE and municipalities while respecting provincial jurisdiction. On racism, he said Canada needs a \u201cfull-scale overhaul\u201d of national institutions: modernize the RCMP, require race-disaggregated data, and shift resources toward community programmes that invest directly in Black and Indigenous people. He linked new spending to building \u201ca revolution in the way our systems serve racialized Canadians\u201d, promising to review all federal expenditures through an equity lens and to expand the Anti-Racism Secretariat and Black-community economic initiatives.",
    "The team agreed that the remote has to be inexpensive to build (target production cost \u2264 \u20ac12.50), profitable (selling price \u2248 2 \u00d7 cost), and immediately distinctive.  Functionally, they want a single-device TV remote with only the essential controls: an on/off switch, a four-way \u201cscroll\u201d cluster that drives on-screen menus, and a locator/beeper button on the TV set.  Extra convenience features discussed include back-lighting for use in the dark, a lock switch to stop accidental presses, shock resistance, water protection for bath use, easy-opening battery hatch, and the option of kinetic \u201chand-dynamo\u201d power if the budget permits.\n\nTechnically the remote will use proven infrared push-button circuitry (\u201cold technology that works\u201d) on a standard, inexpensive chip.  The case will be a single-curve moulding in hard plastic, but a soft, squishy rubber shell and rubber buttons can be clipped on.  These interchangeable \u201cfruit & veg\u201d shells\u2014broccoli, strawberry, banana, etc.\u2014deliver the marketing hook: users can buy several covers and swap them for fashion or comfort.  Colour specification is bright yellow with black buttons to match the company palette, although other colours could be offered later.\n\nTwo physical prototypes were presented.  The first is a rounded \u201cscroll\u201d puck; the second is a banana-shaped stick.  Both place the infrared diode at the tip, house the batteries behind a hatch, and keep the four-direction pad centred.  Evaluators found the banana ergonomically superior\u2014\u201clike a joystick\u201d\u2014but warned that a very soft curved shell might tear, so a hard-plastic core with optional rubber overlay was preferred.  A cost spreadsheet showed the design at \u20ac9.20, well below the limit, and a group scoring exercise gave the concept an average of 1.88 / 7 (very positive) against eleven marketing and usability criteria.",
    "The team reviewed three main areas \u2013 process, work division, and the emerging production plan.\n\nProcess.  Work began with a tool-training/kick-off session, then moved through iterative meetings that combined individual homework with group decisions.  They used the digital white-board, pens, laptops and a shared network to sketch ideas, cost tables and evaluation grids.  A seven-point checklist (easy to use, fashionable, \u201cfeel good,\u201d technological novelty, trendiness, etc.) was adopted to judge successive prototypes.  Members agreed the process was generally smooth and creative, though several felt restricted by the brief (it had to stay a TV-only remote) and by limited background material.  PowerPoint and some software were considered clumsy, yet hands-on prototyping with clay and \u201cstress-ball\u201d rubber was described as \u201cvery creatively stimulating.\u201d\n\nWork division.  Roles were nominally clear\u2014Project Manager (coordination, cost target), Industrial Designer (form and materials), User-Interface Designer (button layout, ergonomics) and Marketing (consumer trends, price positioning)\u2014but in practice ideas flowed freely across boundaries.  The loose structure was praised for fostering creativity, although it occasionally left individuals unsure of what information others possessed.  Leadership was viewed as adequate: the manager set agendas and time limits, while the group made most technical choices collaboratively.\n\nProduction plan.  Financially, the remote must cost \u2264 \u20ac12.50 and retail near \u20ac25 to hit a projected \u20ac50 million profit.  A shared spreadsheet put estimated unit cost at \u20ac11.90, comfortably inside the cap.  Key decisions include: plastic gun-metal base, interchangeable squishy fruit covers (to spur multiple purchases), lithium battery power, voice-recognition chip, single-curved underside, and black labeling.  Remaining open points involve finalizing sensor count and confirming that comfort is retained if some fruit shapes are \u201csquashed flatter.\u201d  The team scheduled another meeting to lock these details and complete the final questionnaire before moving to full production.",
    "The group agreed on four near-term research priorities.  \n1)  Retrain all neural nets with the corrected on-line normalization and delta features, then pick one or two \u201cbest\u201d configurations to test systematically on every Aurora task and language.  \n2)  Explore capacity limits by doubling the hidden-layer size; if accuracy deteriorates when broad multilingual data are added, the cause may be insufficient parameters rather than language mismatch.  \n3)  Start a small set of multi-band/TRAP experiments, but leave more ambitious feature work for after the upcoming evaluation.  \n4)  Integrate OGI\u2019s VAD/LDA-RASTA front end by treating the MLP stream as an additional path; scaling of stream variances in HTK will be tuned later.\n\nPhD D detailed the current multilingual network. Four training regimes were compared: (i) task-specific data (ratio = 1.0), (ii) broad data in the same language (\u22481.1), (iii) three-language broad data including the target language (\u22481.3), and (iv) three-language data without the target language (also \u22481.3). Performance drops first when task-specific material is removed, and drops further when unrelated languages are added, suggesting both task and language mismatch hurt, while excluding the target language adds little additional loss.\n\nPhD C and the professor probed whether separate nets per language or a single multilingual net is better. They noted that adding diverse languages doubles the training set but, with a fixed network size, degrades TI-digits accuracy, implying the model cannot represent the added variability. They also debated alternative targets (articulatory or regression) and the possibility of using several smaller nets chosen at decode time.\n\nOn data release, Adam outlined a web form: by default everything is public on 15 July unless a speaker edits or deletes passages. The team debated legal cover and courtesy: a follow-up e-mail or phone call will confirm receipt, and any late objections will still be honored by \u201cbleeping\u201d or replacing segments. Extra copies will be kept only until the censored master is finalized.",
    "When Ms. Jenny Kwan speaks of \u201cthe gap between program development and its implementation,\u201d she is accusing the government of announcing assistance measures without putting in place the operational details that allow people on the ground to benefit from them. She illustrates the point with several examples.\n\nFirst, she notes that single parents who rely on spousal or child-support payments are excluded from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) rules: once those payments stop, parents often have zero income, yet the program\u2019s eligibility wording prevents them from qualifying. She reminds the House that the Employment Minister has been \u201caware of this for three weeks\u201d but no corrective regulation or directive has been issued, so families remain without income despite the existence of the CERB program.\n\nSecond, she points to housing. Although the government champions a National Housing Strategy and emergency COVID funds for shelters, Kwan argues that there is still no national standard or funding commitment large enough to move people from temporary hotel rooms to permanent housing. Vancouver, which she represents, received less than two per cent of the dedicated urban-Indigenous housing funds despite having Canada\u2019s third-largest urban Indigenous population\u2014evidence, she says, that allocations are not matching real need.\n\nBy highlighting these cases, Kwan\u2019s \u201cgap\u201d refers to the distance between well-publicised federal promises and concrete, timely delivery mechanisms. Her underlying message is that vulnerable Canadians cannot live on announcements; unless eligibility rules are fixed, money flows quickly, and outcomes are tracked, the programs\u2019 stated objectives remain unfulfilled.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) judged the previous meeting review as broadly successful: in their recap they emphasised that the team \u201ccame to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition,\u201d had agreed on a non-traditional form and had assigned clear prototype tasks. That summary convinced the PM the project was \u201con track.\u201d When the marketing data were discussed, the PM valued the findings\u2014especially the willingness of younger users to pay for \u201csomething fancy\u201d and for voice control\u2014but also voiced caution. They worried aloud about speech-recognition reliability, dialect issues and whether the extra cost really matched the survey enthusiasm, signalling a pragmatic, slightly sceptical reading of the research.\n\nWhile looking back at their own presentations, the PM saw them as functional but messy. They joked about \u201cfinally figuring out\u201d slide bullets, admitted acting mostly as \u201cthe secretary,\u201d and later said they had probably \u201cgot way too into it.\u201d The PM felt their slides were heavy on minutes and logistics rather than vision, and they were unsure whether the \u201cconcept\u201d material was ever fully clear.\n\nThe rest of the group viewed progress differently because their day-to-day pain points differed. Designers and Marketing complained that information \u201cdropped off severely,\u201d time between meetings was short and creativity was squeezed by cost targets (e.g., losing the solar panel). Their judgment centred on workload, missing data and budget pressure, whereas the PM focused on having a documented process, so perceptions naturally diverged.\n\nAs for the suggestion to use a panther in the warm-up drawing, opinions were playful but mixed: Marketing loved the panther\u2019s speed, power and stealth, yet others immediately noted a black panther would be \u201cvery difficult to draw,\u201d joked about the Pink Panther, and the idea was quickly set aside.",
    "The team reached fairly clear positions on all four elements while sketching the final \u201cflipped-open, rubber-cased\u201d concept.\n\nButtons for multiple operations  \n\u2022 The Industrial Designer liked the idea of mode\u2013dependent buttons so a single key could trigger two-or-three tasks and keep the face uncluttered.  \n\u2022 Marketing, the Project Manager and the UI expert pushed back: users dislike steep learning curves, elderly hands need obvious cues, and \u201cone button\u2013one action\u201d sells better. The group therefore ruled out extensive multi-mode keys. Only the spinning wheel inside the flip-open section may pull double duty; the surface will keep dedicated buttons for power, the ten numerals, volume and channel.\n\nLCD screen  \n\u2022 Early on the Designer questioned whether an LCD was needed at all, arguing that the TV can supply feedback.  \n\u2022 Marketing insisted an on-board screen cuts waiting time, avoids covering the picture, adds \u201csizzle,\u201d and fits market trends.  \n\u2022 After cost and chip discussions, everyone agreed on an advanced IC, an internal colour LCD and a finger-controlled spinning wheel. Debate then shifted to placement (top versus bottom), but the LCD stayed in the concept.\n\nMicrophone position for voice recognition  \n\u2022 Consensus: voice control is a signature feature, so the mic must be both effective and visible.  \n\u2022 Options floated were the bottom edge, a small grill between the curved halves, or slightly recessed near the hand grip. Final sketches place it low on the front so it isn\u2019t covered but still senses speech clearly.\n\nPush-buttons in the overall concept  \n\u2022 Although \u201cpure touch\u201d was trendy, the firm\u2019s expertise\u2014and user need for immediate access\u2014kept physical push-buttons in the design. They will sit on the outer face for the high-frequency tasks; less-used functions move to the LCD menu inside. Rubberised caps and distinct shapes/colours preserve tactile feedback and corporate styling.",
    "COVID-19 hit Canadian tourism first and hardest.  Border closures, flight suspensions and provincial travel restrictions erased virtually all recreational travel.  Hotels, restaurants, festivals, cruise terminals, guides and small rural or seasonal operators suddenly lost their entire customer base.  Operators could not forecast when borders would reopen, what health protocols would be imposed, or whether they could even afford to re-hire staff.  Fixed costs such as rent, insurance and property taxes continued, while revenues fell to (or near) zero.  Communities that depend on cruise traffic (e.g., Saint John, P.E.I., Vancouver) learned that cruise seasons were cancelled, wiping out tens of millions of dollars.  Event venues and national fairs faced the prospect of a year or more with no gate receipts.  In short, liquidity, payroll and the sheer uncertainty of reopening were existential threats.\n\nTo soften the blow, Ottawa paired economy-wide programs with tourism-specific aid:\n\n\u2022  Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (75 % of payroll, now extended to August) let hotels, attractions and outfitters keep staff on payroll and be ready to reopen.  \n\u2022  The Canada Emergency Business Account and Business Credit Availability Program offered interest-free loans and credit lines for working capital.  \n\u2022  The Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program covered 50 % of rent (with landlords absorbing 25 %), targeting main-street tourism tenants.  \n\u2022  Regional Development Agencies received $675 million\u2014including $70 million earmarked for tourism (e.g., FedDev\u2019s $30 million for southern Ontario, FedNor\u2019s $7 million, Western Economic Diversification\u2019s $3.5 million)\u2014to provide liquidity and advisory services to destination-marketing organizations and small operators.  Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency was instructed to develop comparable support for East-coast operators hurt by the cruise ban.  \n\u2022  Destination Canada redirected international marketing funds to domestic \u201cVisit Local\u201d campaigns so businesses could pivot to nearby customers when health authorities permit travel.  \n\nThese combined measures give tourism enterprises cash-flow breathing room, protect jobs, and lay groundwork for a safe, phased resumption of travel once public-health authorities allow.",
    "The team heard three short presentations.  \n\u2022  Components/engineering: Kate outlined the electrical chain \u2013 sealed long-life battery \u2192 printed circuit \u2192 custom or off-the-shelf IC \u2192 transistor amplifier \u2192 IR LED.  A custom IC would be dearer and slower to develop but is the only practical way to add full voice recognition; an off-the-shelf part would force a button-only remote.  \n\u2022  User interface: Kendra argued for \u201cas few controls as possible\u201d: a thumb-wheel slider for volume, two channel buttons, a large power/menu key and otherwise voice commands.  The TV screen will display any menus.  She favoured a mouse-like, hand-filling shell with clear tactile differences between slider and buttons.  \n\u2022  Marketing: Andrew reported survey data: users hate ugly, over-buttoned remotes, will pay extra for style, and rank \u201cinnovative technology\u201d second only to appearance.  Interchangeable fashion skins and a way to find a lost remote scored highly; older users were wary of voice but liked simplicity.\n\nDiscussion converted the input into firm decisions.  \nEnergy source: adopt a factory-sealed lithium pack guaranteed for at least five\u2013ten years; no user replacement, no back-lighting to save power.  \nCore components: commission a low-power custom voice-enabled IC, standard discrete parts, wide-angle IR LED.  \nFunctional design: keep manual fall-backs (power/menu, channel \u00b1, volume slider) but let voice perform every command; include a clap/whistle locator tone.  Teletext, multi-device control and extra audio settings were rejected to hold cost and schedule.  \nIndustrial design: an organically curved \u201chand-stone\u201d, slightly slimmer than a computer mouse, able to stand upright.  The hard plastic chassis carries a stretchy rubber cover that can be swapped for seasonal colours or fruit/vegetable prints; the corporate yellow roundel is moulded into each skin.\n\nPrototype: a foam model showed the final layout\u2014IR window across the top, microphone port near the front, side slider, opposite channel keys, oversize power button centre-rear\u2014and confirmed it meets grip, aesthetics and cost (\u2248\u20ac12.50) targets.  The group agreed to refine tooling and move to detailed engineering.",
    "DARPA MEETING DECISION  \nThe group set a clear July-mid-deadline for the DARPA principal-investigators\u2019 meeting.  By that date they will (1) show two demonstrations \u2013 the already-planned Transcriber-Interface and a small, pre-stored Question-Answering mock-up \u2013 and (2) move the meeting-speech transcription pipeline into \u201cproduction mode,\u201d so they can hand DARPA a vetted subset of fully transcribed meetings and explain the end-to-end process.  All further organisational work (beep files, IBM outsourcing, directory clean-up, participant releases) was prioritised only insofar as it supports that July deliverable.\n\nPAPER CONTENTS  \nThe six-page conference paper being finalised (for the \u201cNew Corpora\u201d special session) has three sections:  \n1.  Quantitative comparison of speech overlap in four corpora (ICSI Meeting Recorder, ICSI Robustness, Switchboard, CallHome) using both \u201cwords\u201d and \u201cspurts\u201d (continuous speech segments \u2265500 ms apart).  \n2.  Impact of overlap on ASR accuracy.  Recognition output was rescored while ignoring non-foreground segments to isolate errors caused by background speech.  \n3.  Preliminary turn-taking study of \u201cinterrupts.\u201d  Using punctuation-derived sentence boundaries and lexical tags (discourse markers, back-channels, filled pauses, disfluencies), the authors analyse where second speakers begin their utterances relative to the first speaker\u2019s sentence.\n\nKEY STATISTICS QUOTED IN THE PAPER  \n\u2022  Speaker dominance: one participant (Morgan) accounts for 56 % of the words in the Robustness meetings.  \n\u2022  Word-level overlap rates: Meeting Recorder \u2248 18 %, Switchboard \u2248 14 %, CallHome \u2248 14 %, Robustness \u2248 9 %.  \n\u2022  Removing back-channels lowers Switchboard overlap only slightly (\u2248 14 \u2192 11 %), showing back-channels are not the sole cause.  \n\u2022  When ASR scoring ignores non-foreground regions, error on overlapped material falls almost to the non-overlap baseline, confirming most degradation comes from insertions in background speech.  \n\u2022  Interrupt analysis shows the probability of a second speaker starting rises sharply after a discourse marker, back-channel or filled pause, whereas mid-phrase interruptions are rare.\n\nThese results motivate both the DARPA demo focus on overlap-robust recognition and the continued collection of longer meeting data sets.",
    "\u2022 Training / test plan for the digits corpus  \nThe team finally agreed to keep one common acoustic model and score it on two data sets: (1) their own \u201cmeeting-room\u201d digits (close-talking and far-field channels) and (2) the clean TI-Digits studio set.  Running the identical decoder on both corpora will let them separate microphone/room effects from recogniser weaknesses and give numbers that are directly comparable with the Aurora papers.  Switchboard-trained models will be the starting point; if time permits they will add a small amount of in-room digit speech for supervised channel adaptation, but they will not build a task-specific HTK digit system.\n\n\u2022 Current technique and its limits  \nRecognition is done with SRI\u2019s tandem system (telephone-band PLP-NN features into an HTK back-end).  The set-up gives good scores on telephone speech but is awkward for research: new features have to be written to individual \u201cp-files\u201d, the front-end cannot be piped, and the VTLN / online normalisation scripts assume one full utterance per speaker.  Adaptation helps native speakers by only ~0.2 % and the far-field microphones still double the word-error rate.  Because the net was trained on Switchboard, digits that differ phonetically or acoustically from conversational English remain a weak point.\n\n\u2022 Progress since the last meeting  \n- Lapel microphone evaluated and found to outperform the headsets on breath\u2013click noise.  \n- Forced-alignment quality improved markedly by looser pruning and by a proximity constraint on word placement; new CTM \u201cspurt\u201d files now line up all speakers for overlap studies.  \n- Online-normalisation bug fixed; straight PLP baselines are now in line with OGI\u2019s numbers.  \n- Scripts for far-field rescoring and for running the recogniser on TI-Digits are almost finished.\n\n\u2022 Causes of delay  \nChuck\u2019s feature-I/O rewrite is still pending; without it the group must keep dumping intermediate files.  Retraining the neural nets with the corrected normalisation and wider-band features is tying up CPUs, and Saturday\u2019s multi-site meeting had to be pushed because several members lack mobile access.  As a result, far-field digit tests and the comparison with TI-Digits are running about a week behind the Eurospeech draft schedule.",
    "\u201cTriple R\u201d was preferred to \u201cTriple RC\u201d because dropping the \u201cC\u201d made the name cleaner and visually stronger. With \u201cRC\u201d attached, the word \u201ctriple\u201d lost impact and the label began to look like \u201ctriple-remote-control,\u201d which confused the idea of three R\u2019s and cluttered package graphics. \u201cTriple R\u201d is shorter, easier to print on the casing, and preserves the memorable \u201cthree-R\u201d motif without implying a second acronym.\n\nFor the product\u2019s audience, the team settled on the 15-to-35 bracket\u2014especially the 25-to-35 \u201cyoung professional\u201d slice. Survey tables showed that this group is noticeably more willing to pay extra for modern styling and for emerging functions such as speech recognition. They also have disposable income and are comfortable adopting new gadgets, matching the firm\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d slogan. Older buyers were seen as less interested in voice control and less likely to replace the handset that shipped with their TV.\n\nFrom the marketing perspective, focusing on younger users leverages two advantages: they are early adopters who create word-of-mouth buzz, and they actively seek trendy, customized devices. Research indicated they \u201cwould spend more money for it to look fancy\u201d and rated advanced features highest, giving the team clear positioning and a price premium.\n\nChannel-selection generated lively debate. Marketing argued that people still like to \u201czap\u201d through all stations and occasionally jump straight to channel 25, so some form of rapid numeric access was essential. The UI designer pushed for extreme simplicity\u2014only up/down keys and an LCD menu\u2014suggesting users could pre-set four or five favourites. The compromise kept the physical up/down buttons, added a mute, and allowed direct entry through the LCD interface rather than a full numeric keypad, balancing minimal hardware with the ability to reach any channel quickly.",
    "The team began by reviewing marketing data from 100-person lab tests and fashion consultants. Findings were clear: consumers dislike the look and feel of current remotes, use only about 10 % of the buttons, and will pay more for devices that look \u201cfancy.\u201d Attractive appearance ranked twice as important as technical novelty, which itself ranked twice as high as ease-of-use. Style trends pointed toward bright fruit-and-vegetable colours and \u201cspongy\u201d tactile finishes, especially for younger buyers (15-35), the segment judged large enough to hit the four-million-unit sales goal.\n\nTranslating the research, the group\u2019s feature wish-list centred on simplicity and distinctiveness. Core controls were pared to power, volume and channel, with one \u201center/menu\u201d key for deeper settings. Convenience ideas included one-touch macros (e.g., \u201cplay DVD\u201d turns on TV and selects the right input), a locator beeper, and possibly speech prompts like \u201cWhere\u2019s the remote?\u201d\u2014all balanced against the \u20ac12.50 cost target. Rechargeable options were debated: kinetic watch-style charging and solar cells were intriguing but costly; conventional batteries remained the fallback.\n\nDesign opinions converged on a small, ergonomic, two-piece flip unit: a rubber-clad outer shell (cheap, grippy, swappable in fashion colours) over a plastic housing. Inside, the lower half would carry large, anti-RSI rubber buttons; the upper half an LCD or iPod-style touch/scroll pad for less-used functions. Titanium and full touchscreen were rejected as too expensive; a scroll wheel plus monochrome LCD was seen as the best sophistication-to-price compromise.\n\nThroughout, members stressed that incremental tweaks weren\u2019t enough; to win buyers the remote had to \u201cre-invent\u201d interaction\u2014stripping clutter, adding smart shortcuts and offering a playful, customisable form that clearly departs from today\u2019s anonymous black rectangles.",
    "\u2022  Quality assurance  \nKirsty Williams told the Committee she will not create a single, centrally-run inspectorate, but is drawing up a new, \u201ccoherent, effective and comprehensive\u201d assurance model for the whole tertiary sector.  Estyn and the QAA will continue to be used, any future framework must meet ENQA standards, and the forthcoming PCET Bill will let the new Commission impose a good-governance condition and graded, \u201csoft-to-hard\u201d powers of intervention when quality or finances cause concern.\n\n\u2022  Institutions in the high-risk category  \nHEFCW\u2019s Deputy Chief Executive, Bethan Owen, reported that one Welsh university is currently classed as high risk, five are medium and two low.  Risk is rising because of demographic decline, Brexit and pension pressures.  Although no collapse is expected, she warned that more institutions could move into the high-risk band if income tightens and loan covenants become harder to meet.\n\n\u2022  Five principles for re-opening schools  \nIn the COVID session the Minister listed five tests that must all be satisfied before pupils return in larger numbers:  \n  1. health and emotional safety of learners and staff;  \n  2. consistency with wider public-health measures;  \n  3. clear evidence-based communication that wins the confidence of parents and staff;  \n  4. fairness in deciding which groups return first; and  \n  5. practical feasibility\u2014 sufficient workforce, social-distancing, transport and hygiene arrangements.  She stressed that re-opening is \u201cnot imminent\u201d.\n\n\u2022  Expectations for new examinations and qualifications  \nSummer GCSE and A-level grades will be awarded through centre-assessed grades moderated nationally to protect standards; results will be issued on the normal August dates.  Vocational awards that require practical competency will be delayed or adapted case-by-case.  The aim is to let learners progress while keeping the system \u201crobust and fair\u201d.\n\n\u2022  Responding to doubts about whether this is enough  \nWilliams acknowledged anxiety but insisted the combined quality-assurance reforms, financial monitoring and the staged, criteria-led approach to schooling and assessment show the Government is acting decisively: \u201cWe will move only when it is safe, with absolute transparency, and with powers ready to intervene where quality or sustainability are threatened.\u201d",
    "When the discussion shifted from the prototype itself to the way it had been brought to life, the team drew a clear line between what energized them and what frustrated them.\n\nLikes  \n\u2022 Autonomy in key decisions: Although the brief locked them into making a TV-only remote, they appreciated that everything inside that boundary\u2014look, feel, degree of technological sophistication\u2014was theirs to shape.  \n\u2022 Team chemistry and hands-on building: Several members said they \u201cenjoyed making the model,\u201d calling the curved, thumb-shaped buttons and gun-metal finish \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The shared network, wireless laptops and even the novelty of digital pens made collaboration feel modern and efficient.  \n\u2022 Balance of fashion and tech: Having room to chase both aesthetics (\u201cfashion-forward\u201d) and features (voice recognition, lithium battery) was repeatedly cited as rewarding and made the end product feel like \u201ca winner.\u201d\n\nDislikes  \n\u2022 Creative constraints imposed at the outset: Being told the project had to be a TV remote \u201cstifled\u201d creativity; some felt a multi-device controller or broader concept would have been more marketable.  \n\u2022 Prototype/material limitations: The clay model, missing labels and makeshift cherry-fruit cover prevented a full usability test and led to low \u201cease-of-use\u201d scores.  \n\u2022 Irritating or unclear tools and surveys: The obligatory questionnaires and digital pens were called \u201cannoying,\u201d and cost spreadsheets forced compromises (e.g., choosing lithium vs. multiple AAAs).  \n\u2022 Market and scope worries: A few doubted consumers would buy a specialized remote unless they\u2019d lost the original, underscoring discomfort with the project\u2019s narrow end goal.\n\nOverall, they enjoyed the collaborative, design-rich journey but bristled at external restrictions and the occasional tool or budget hurdle.",
    "Dave\u2019s latest SRI digit-recognition runs used the PZMF front end, which subtracts a 12-second running average spectrum before resynthesising the waveform.  Mean subtraction cut far-microphone error from 6 % to 4.5 %, but near-mic error rose from 1.2 % to 2.4 %.  \n\nWhy the mixed result?  \n\u2022 Channel adaptation overlap \u2013 SRI\u2019s recogniser already does conversation-side mean and MLLR normalization, so an extra global subtraction can over-normalise clean, near-mic speech.  HTK, which lacks this adaptation, showed only gains.  \n\u2022 Echo artefacts \u2013 The very long window behaves like a reverberation filter; when the average is removed and the signal is rebuilt, faint pre/post-echoes appear.  These confuse SRI\u2019s detailed tied-state triphone models; listening tests revealed \u201cghost\u201d speech in quiet regions.  \n\nProposed remedies  \nMorgan suggested Avendano/Hermansky-style tricks: after subtraction, high-pass or energy-gate the power trajectory, zeroing the lowest-energy frames (where echoes dominate).  A VAD-guided mask could retain speech while discarding synthetic echoes; keeping an occasional echo is judged safer than deleting speech.  \n\nGain question  \nDave observed the processed PZM files sound louder.  The group agreed simple amplification should not change error rates if both training and test are scaled identically; any benefit probably reflects an improved SNR, not raw level.  \n\nRelated explorations  \nAdam revisited phase mean subtraction.  Taking the mean of the raw FFT (not log), extracting its phase and subtracting it sidesteps earlier modulo-2\u03c0 problems; he will test whether this normalizes channel phase without introducing artefacts.  \n\nOverall, mean subtraction helps on mismatched, far-mic speech, but its interaction with SRI\u2019s existing adaptations and the echoes it introduces require additional filtering or VAD-based trimming to avoid hurting clean channels.",
    "During the recent meetings several operational points were settled.  \nMixed signals:  Transcribers will align and correct time-marks while listening to the mixed (table-top) recording, switching to individual channels only when overlap is suspected.  This avoids loading multiple waveforms and lets them catch most cross-talk; truly pathological mixed segments will be flagged with an \u201cX\u201d rather than deleted so later forced-alignment can still reject them.\n\nVAD improvements:  The new VAD now uses noise-compensated MFCCs, nine-frame context and a small neural net (12\u00d79 \u224811 k parameters).  It is followed by LDA filtering and on-line normalisation.  Latency has dropped from 270 ms to about 220 ms, and the team expects to trim another 20 ms by moving delta computation or shortening smoothing windows.  A lighter alternative (band-ratio SNR after cleaning plus median filter) was prototyped; it eliminates the neural-net delay but still needs better global thresholds.\n\nVAD results:  Relative word-error-rate reductions are 53\u201358 % on well- and medium-matched SpeechDat-Car data, rising to 60 + % with the \u201ccheating\u201d clean-speech VAD.  On highly-mismatched data deletions increase, giving roughly 15 % relative loss, but overall score is still slightly better than the previous system.\n\nPostdoc A\u2019s headphone verdict: the new ear-cup sets are markedly more comfortable and provide higher gain; minor slippage occurs on large heads but can be cured by tightening the rear strap.\n\nIncreasing disk space:  Broadcast-News P-files are being archived to tape and deleted (freeing ~11 GB); Aurora, Spanish and SPINE CD-ROM data are being moved to a non-backed-up disk; together this opens room for five-plus new meetings until the new 18 GB drives arrive.\n\nDeadline:  Participants must review their transcript pages and reply by 15 July; silent consent after that date allows public release, though follow-up calls will be made to anyone who has not acknowledged the e-mail.",
    "Under the \u201cnew-purpose\u201d arrangements introduced when mainstream sites closed, special schools are treated as essential provision. Because their pupils have complex medical, behavioural or communication needs, the Minister confirmed that it would be neither safe nor practical to move them into hub schools. Consequently, each special school is expected to stay open, so far as public-health guidance and staffing allow, for three groups:\n\n\u2022 its own most-vulnerable learners, whose individual education or safeguarding plans cannot be met elsewhere;  \n\u2022 children of critical-service staff who are already on that roll; and  \n\u2022 any looked-after or ALN pupils for whom the school is the normal placement.  \n\nHead-teachers and specialist support staff remain on site to design an adapted programme\u2014educational, therapeutic and respite\u2014rather than the full curriculum, and to plan more resilient arrangements for the period after Easter.\n\nWith regard to the Pupil Development Grant for looked-after children (PDG-LAC), individual special schools no longer receive an automatic per-pupil sum. Instead, the grant is held and administered by the regional consortia through PDG-LAC co-ordinators. Special schools therefore:\n\n\u2022 identify the needs of their own looked-after or previously-looked-after pupils;  \n\u2022 bid, through the co-ordinator, for funds for bespoke interventions\u2014speech therapy, sensory equipment, family-engagement work, etc.; and  \n\u2022 contribute to or benefit from wider regional projects (for example, attachment-disorder or adverse-childhood-experience training) that the consortium bankrolls from the same pot.\n\nIn short, special schools deliver day-to-day support and evidence impact at learner level, while the consortium decides allocations, assures consistency and evaluates region-wide outcomes.",
    "The three presenters unveiled the first physical mock-up together.  \n\u2022 Industrial Designer began by handing it round and describing the form: a gently curved body \u201cmoulded to the shape of your hand\u201d, with a scroll strip on the left for volume and two large push-buttons on the right for channel up/down.  A prominent, oversized power key sat on the top face, while the infrared emitter was placed so it would function whether the unit was pointed straight ahead or held like a phone.  He added that, with a slightly broader base, the control could even stand upright as a \u201cfashion item.\u201d  \n\n\u2022 User Interface picked up the story, stressing materials and tactility.  The shell would be a lightweight plastic core that slid into coloured, stretch-on rubber \u201ccovers\u201d similar to i-Pod skins.  These spongy sleeves would supply anti-RSI cushioning, protect the electronics and let owners personalise the look; each cover would include holes for the keys and carry the yellow-circle \u201cRR\u201d logo at the tip.  A Play-Doh model was shown to demonstrate the softness and banana-coloured branding options.  \n\n\u2022 Project Manager confirmed that the concept satisfied the brief of looking \u201cdifferent\u201d while still hitting the cost target, and he encouraged the team to lengthen the body slightly so the unit could free-stand, giving another place for a logo.\n\nMaking it universal: later discussion centred on technical and usability implications.  The electronics team warned that generating multiple infrared \u201cmorse codes\u201d for different brands would require a more advanced (and costlier) processor.  The group nevertheless agreed a universal remote was desirable to maximise market reach; they would limit themselves to basic TV functions to avoid an explosion of buttons, rely on a menu key for brand-specific features, and research whether a common \u201cmenu open\u201d command existed across sets.  Interchangeable language covers were suggested to localise button labels, and voice control was deferred as the technology was judged immature.",
    "The Industrial Designer repeatedly focused on making the prototype visually striking, structurally robust yet pleasant to touch, and adaptable to the tastes of different user groups.  \n\nAppearance  \n\u2022   He proposed a \u201cbright blue\u201d body with \u201cyellow buttons,\u201d later saying any special-edition shells could be swapped \u201clike Nokia phones\u201d so style-conscious or younger buyers could personalise the look.  \n\u2022   To keep the handset eye-catching on a shelf, he favoured \u201ccolourful, recyclable plastic\u201d for the case and a fluorescent-green LED/menu key.  When fruit-shaped concepts were reviewed he accepted them, noting that a fun \u201csnail\u201d or \u201cstrawberry\u201d image could help marketing.  \n\u2022   For the corporate version he agreed a single-curve, biomorphic outline rather than sharp angles, because shoppers \u201cwant it comfy and roundy.\u201d  \n\nStructure & materials  \n\u2022   Internally he listed \u201cresistor, capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator and, if possible, a rechargeable battery\u201d on a \u201csimple, inexpensive chip.\u201d  \n\u2022   Externally he insisted the shell be \u201cvery strong plastic\u201d so a drop would not crack it, while all keys should be \u201csoft rubber\u201d because \u201cyou\u2019ll be touching the buttons more.\u201d  \n\u2022   He argued the handset must be small enough to \u201cfit into the hand,\u201d allow every control to be reached \u201cwith one thumb,\u201d and have raised, prominently shaped on/off and volume keys for both left- and right-handed use.  \n\nCustomer preferences  \n\u2022   Young, trend-driven buyers \u201cwould like changeable covers or primary colours,\u201d might pay extra for an LCD or speech recognition, and enjoy playful fruit shapes.  \n\u2022   Older or \u201crich\u201d users, he said, prefer simplicity, big labels and a reassuringly solid feel; thus he cautioned against too many scroll wheels, favouring a single joystick or push buttons to keep operation intuitive.",
    "The committee heard three distinct topics.  \n\n1.  $75-million anti-trafficking envelope  \nMinister Monsef explained that the money is the federal contribution to the five-year National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking.  Funds flow through the new \u201cEmpowerment\u201d pillar to frontline, survivor-led and community organizations that provide emergency shelter, exit services, trauma counselling and legal support to women and girls who have been trafficked or sexually exploited.  Hundreds of groups have already received operating grants; additional agreements are being finalized and \u201cmore will be announced in the coming days.\u201d  MPs were assured that the allocation is meant to reach every region and that no new bureaucratic program is being created \u2013 the dollars are being added to existing contribution agreements so that help reaches victims quickly.\n\n2.  \u201cRisk appetite\u201d in the university sector  \nAsked whether any Welsh universities were taking imprudent financial risks, HEFCW chief executive Dr. David Blaney said overall risk is rising but remains \u201cmanaged.\u201d  The \u201csolution\u201d he outlined centres on governance: an independent, Wales-wide review of university councils; a refreshed governors\u2019 data toolkit so boards can benchmark themselves; mandatory scenario-planning that includes zero-growth income forecasts; and HEFCW consent for any significant new borrowing.  This mix of stronger information, external challenge and ongoing monitoring is designed to align risk appetite across institutions and keep all eight universities out of the \u201chigh-risk\u201d category.\n\n3.  Deputy Prime-Minister Freeland on systemic racism  \nIn exchanges with Mr. Singh, Ms. Freeland unequivocally acknowledged \u201csystemic racism against Indigenous people and Black Canadians.\u201d  She stated that rooting it out \u201cwill not be simple,\u201d condemned racial profiling as \u201cabsolutely inappropriate,\u201d and noted that cabinet was already discussing RCMP use-of-force policies.  She committed the government to work with racialized communities and provinces on concrete reforms, insisting that combating systemic racism is integral to Canada\u2019s recovery agenda.",
    "Thilo\u2019s automatic speech/non-speech segmenter is now regarded as \u201cworking so well\u201d that the group plans to make it the default basis both for meeting transcription and for the next round of recognition experiments.  Empirically it is delivering very high recall; it occasionally over-segments, so precision is lower, but the surplus boundaries are viewed as an advantage because they let the recogniser learn explicit noise models and let the transcribers delete rather than insert material.\n\nRecent activity has focused on tightening the output and checking its impact on downstream tasks.  Thilo has just re-run the segmenter on a fresh sample meeting; that file, with the new \u201cbeep\u2013digit\u2013beep\u201d boundary markers requested by the transcription staff, is being sent out now so the team can measure how many extraneous beeps remain and estimate realistic turn-around time.  If the revised run looks good they will switch the transcriber pipeline to automatic segmentation for all future meetings and use the same boundaries for acoustic model adaptation and for prosodic-boundary research.\n\nBeyond that, two follow-up changes are on the table: (1) generating speech\u2013non-speech label files directly from the segmenter output to create training data for improved background-noise modelling; and (2) retaining a record of where human editors move or delete boundaries so the researchers can quantify segmentation errors automatically.  In short, the segmenter is stable, reliable enough for production use, and is now being integrated more tightly into both the transcription workflow and the recognition experiments.",
    "The price dispute in the interactive evaluation stemmed from the different facets each designer was safeguarding.  The Industrial Designer looked only at the bill-of-materials: a rigid plastic shell, four rubber keys and a low-end infrared diode.  From that angle the remote was \u201cpretty cheap to develop\u201d (he scored price \u201c1\u201d).  The User-Interface (UI) designer, however, was already counting the software menu system and a possible LCD, both flagged in the \u201chot trends\u201d list.  Because those items still had to be outsourced and programmed, she rated price \u201c2\u20133\u201d and asked that cost appear on the white-board.  In short, the Industrial Designer focused on manufacturing cost while the UI designer included the future interaction features required by users and trend reports, so they landed on different figures.\n\nAfter the formal product-evaluation the project-manager froze the design and scheduled immediate production.  The UI designer objected because no time had been left for a redesign loop if field testers uncovered usability faults.  Her priority was user acceptance; she feared \u201cthe first generation could flop for some silly reason,\u201d while the rest of the team preferred to hit the market quickly.\n\nYellow (with some red) was proposed by the UI designer because they are the corporate R&R colours and fit the \u201cfruit & veg\u2009/\u2009quirky\u201d trend identified by marketing.  Bright yellow also helps elderly users find the remote quickly, satisfying a top user requirement.\n\nMarketing disputed the UI\u2019s preferred banana-shaped housing for two market-driven reasons: stocking and shipping a curved unit is costly, and a literal fruit shape risks being seen as a novelty toy rather than a mainstream device.  They therefore pushed for a flatter, \u201cchunk\u201d variant that would signal reliability and fit retail shelves.",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans and Nick Brazil all support the original vision of the Welsh Baccalaureate\u2014developing broad, work-ready skills\u2014but believe it is currently falling short as a pathway to employment.\n\nKay Martin told the committee that most employers \u201cwant them to get their main qualification\u201d first, along with basic literacy, numeracy and digital competence. In her experience the Bac is \u201cnot the programme that engages employers the best\u201d; initiatives such as Career Ready internships or WorldSkills coaching give clearer, job-related benefits, especially for vocational areas like health and social care. She therefore favours a review that trims paperwork, joins the Bac to existing employer-led schemes and allows colleges discretion where it adds little value.\n\nDafydd Evans agreed that employers, parents and many learners \u201cdo not understand the Welsh Bac\u201d and that the qualification has \u201clost its way.\u201d He argued that the name itself is unclear and that limited curriculum time is now diverted to compulsory GCSE resits, crowding out Bac study at Levels 1 and 2. To make it genuinely useful for work he wants a fundamental redesign driven by employers, with stronger emphasis on employability and entrepreneurial skills and formal, structured links between businesses, schools and colleges.\n\nNick Brazil reported that in regular meetings with employer boards \u201cvery few of them mention the Welsh Bac.\u201d Although employers still respect the founding idea, the Bac has become \u201crigorous, bureaucratic\u201d and burdens learners with extra assessment rather than genuine skill-building. Like his colleagues he calls for a rethink that refocuses on practical, industry-relevant skills and gives students the option to pursue alternative, proven programmes.\n\nCollectively, they see the current Welsh Bac as an uneven, poorly understood route to employment and urge substantial reform rather than abolition.",
    "The team added a series of refinements to both the functional specification and the working design.  \n\nFunctions  \n\u2022 Core set agreed: on/off, channel up-down, direct numeric entry, volume, mute.  \n\u2022 \u201cFavourite\u2010channel\u201d scroll wheel introduced; lets users flick through a personalised list rather than the full channel range.  \n\u2022 Locator feature retained: a button on the charging cradle makes the handset beep when lost.  \n\u2022 Voice-recognition was explored as a premium option for the 15-35 \u201cgadget-oriented\u201d target group, but concerns about cost, reliability and extra power draw led to postponing it for a later version.  \n\u2022 Teletext and multi-device control were dropped to keep time-to-market short.  \n\u2022 Three \u201cbuckets\u201d proposed for any extra features: Audio (sound settings), Video (picture adjustments) and Device (miscellaneous such as sleep-timer). These could sit behind a sliding drawer so the face remains uncluttered.  \n\nWorking Design  \n\u2022 Physical model shown: white ABS body with red rubber over-mould for impact resistance; scroll wheel in green; cradle contains two blue charging contacts.

    "The Project Manager repeatedly framed the remote as a mass-market, international product.  He wants a unit that can be sold \u201cworld-wide, mainly Europe and North America\u201d, and ultimately sees the buyer base as \u201cpretty much anybody under sixty \u2013 grannies to kids \u2013 anyone who replaces a broken remote and has a bit of spare cash.\u201d  \n\nPrice discipline is non-negotiable: retail must stay at \u20ac25 and the bill-of-materials at \u2264 \u20ac12.50, because the project\u2019s financial goal is \u201cabout fifty-million Euro profit.\u201d  He reminds the team that every extra button, display or hinge must fit those numbers; therefore \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a very high-tech, ultra-modern remote for twelve-fifty.\u201d\n\nRegarding Marketing\u2019s suggestions (spongy fruit-and-veg styling, bright colours, a \u201cfind-me\u201d sound, yellow \u201cbanana\u201d concept, monkey noises, etc.), he is open if they help the product stand out but stresses practicality and cost.  Rubber housing is attractive because it is durable and differentiates the look, yet he cautions that articulated joints, USB programming ports or an elaborate LCD must be justified financially and mechanically.  He even asks whether articulation can be dropped to avoid weak points, and whether the USB interface would \u201cpush the cost of the overall unit up.\u201d\n\nOn functionality he supports a limited, clearly usable feature set: essential TV controls, possibly a joystick-driven menu and a computer-aided set-up to simplify coding, but warns against \u201closing sight of user-friendliness.\u201d  A universal (multipurpose) capability is desirable so customers need only one handset, provided it can still be built within cost; he tasks the UI and technical teams to verify feasibility before the next meeting.\n\nFinally, he insists that concrete sales targets and the chosen audience profile be settled now, so Marketing can size the market and Engineering can design to cost for the next design review.",
    "The User Interface (UI) representative kept the financial framework in clear view throughout the discussions. First, when the team reviewed the business brief\u2014\u20ac25 retail price, \u20ac12.50 maximum manufacturing cost and a \u20ac50 million profit target\u2014UI immediately translated those numbers into volume, noting that \u201cwe have to sell at least four million\u201d units to hit the margin the parent company expects.  \n\nDuring later cost-sheet reviews UI repeatedly looked for components that could be simplified or removed to stay under the \u20ac12.50 ceiling. When the bill of materials crept above target, UI proposed \u201cchanging the battery,\u201d arguing that customers had never asked for an exotic power source. In UI\u2019s view, kinetic cells were a nice talking point but an unnecessary cost driver; buyers are \u201cused to buying batteries,\u201d so reverting to inexpensive, replaceable cells would cut several euros without hurting perceived value.  \n\nThe same cost-first reasoning surfaced in the voice-recognition debate. UI agreed that the feature was appealing, but backed its removal from the standard model once the extra electronics pushed the build cost past budget. Voice control, UI suggested, could be reserved for a higher-priced \u201cbusiness-class\u201d version, letting the mainstream remote stay profit-viable.  \n\nIn short, UI consistently championed the production-cost cap, translated financial targets into practical sales goals, and favored swapping out kinetic batteries (and other high-ticket parts) for standard, cheaper alternatives so the remote could meet its price point without compromising the look, colour options and overall user friendliness that consumers actually notice.",
    "Marketing and Industrial Design kept clashing because they looked at the same \u201cfuture-proof\u201d ideas through very different lenses.\n\nMarketing\u2019s priority was differentiation and long-term revenue.  \n\u2022 An \u201cup-gradable\u201d remote (slot-in card, changeable cases, lifetime guarantee) would let the company sell add-ons later, keep customers loyal and justify a premium \u201cexclusive\u201d price point.  \n\u2022 A visible energy story\u2014docking station that lights up or a kinetic charger\u2014could be turned into attention-grabbing ad copy and a clear point of sale message (\u201cnever buy batteries again\u201d).\n\nThe Industrial Designer, however, was focused on feasibility and day-to-day usability.  \n\u2022 Up-gradability meant extra connectors, firmware, and\u2014by his count\u2014\u201cmore buttons\u201d and different internal layouts. That risked pushing production cost above the \u20ac12.50 limit, complicating assembly, and, most importantly, breaking the clean, simple interface that made the prototype easy for elderly users to understand.  \n\u2022 He dismissed kinetic charging because users would have to \u201cshake the remote\u201d before every use, something seniors are unlikely to tolerate. A passive docking station that also acts as a \u201cfind-my-remote\u201d beacon solved power and storage at once without changing user behaviour.  \n\u2022 Making the product modular would also undermine the robust, sealed housing he had designed to survive drops; it could also cripple the straightforward warranty he was planning (\u201cyou break it, we replace it\u201d).\n\nIn short, Marketing pushed ideas that raised perceived value and future revenue streams, while the Industrial Designer resisted anything that inflated cost, complicated ergonomics, or jeopardised reliability. Their disagreements came from these fundamentally different success criteria rather than from the ideas themselves.",
    "The Committee was told that HEFCW already has a clear statutory \u201cladder\u201d of sanctions \u2013 from enhanced monitoring through to directions enforceable by injunction \u2013 and the Minister does not regard those powers as either frightening or unusable.  She pointed out that they are proportionate to the amount of public money an institution receives and provide HEFCW with sufficient leverage should quality, governance or financial management fail.  Although HEFCW has not yet invoked its formal powers in the recent Swansea University or Trinity Saint David cases, the Minister \u201cexpects them to use the full remit of their powers if they feel that is necessary\u201d and trusts their professional judgement.\n\nNevertheless, evidence from HEFCW and universities convinced the Minister that the present Act offers only a few, rather blunt, steps.  In designing the forthcoming PCET legislation she therefore intends to insert more flexible, graduated tools \u2013 for example advisory notices, guidance or enhanced data-reporting \u2013 so that the new Commission can intervene earlier and more supportively before problems reach the stage of formal direction or injunction.\n\nTurning to the COVID-19 emergency, colleges and universities remain autonomous bodies, so decisions on temporary closure or moving teaching on-line currently rest with their governing bodies.  Welsh Government is in daily contact with FE principals and Universities Wales to co-ordinate those decisions, ensure vulnerable learners are protected and maintain remote learning.  The forthcoming UK Coronavirus Bill will, however, give Welsh Ministers reserve powers to compel an FE college, university or other provider to close, remain open, or redeploy staff and resources if public-health circumstances require a national direction.",
    "The team will market a universal, \u201cfashion-forward\u201d remote that retails worldwide for \u20ac25 while costing no more than \u20ac12.50 to build, leaving a \u20ac12.50 margin. Hitting the finance department\u2019s profit goal of \u20ac50 million therefore means moving roughly four million units and boosting the margin with optional add-ons.\n\nPositioning and product decisions support that objective:\n\n\u2022 Universal reach \u2013 The remote will operate TVs, DVD players and any other company devices, handling NTSC, PAL and region differences so one model can be sold in every major market.\n\n\u2022 Broad cultural appeal \u2013 All icons and button labels will use internationally recognised symbols, and the layout will stay familiar enough for older users while remaining \u201ctrendy\u201d for younger buyers.\n\n\u2022 Distinctive, upgradeable look \u2013 A slim, slightly curved shape, quality hard-plastic body, rubberised keys and an Apple-style \u201csleek white or titanium\u201d finish make the base unit feel premium without inflating cost. Snap-on coloured \u201cfronts/faceplates\u201d let customers customise the remote; these low-cost accessories create an extra revenue stream and keep the product visible in style media.\n\n\u2022 Convenience features \u2013 A large mode-switch button toggles between TV, DVD and other functions to avoid the clutter of multi-device remotes. A locator beacon (TV-mounted page button) reduces the frustration of lost remotes, a selling point the marketers will emphasise.\n\nPromotion will stress universality, ease of use and personalisation. Cross-selling with the company\u2019s new DVD player and TV lines, plus worldwide accessory sales, should generate the required volume and push profit past the \u20ac50 million target.",
    "Committee members examined two, inter-linked strands of policy.  \nFirst, the long-term \u201cHealthy Weight: Healthy Wales\u201d strategy sets out broad, whole-system measures: stricter school food standards, possible regulation of price-promotions and energy drinks, better use of planning to limit fast-food outlets, and stronger evaluation of physical-activity and diet schemes from preschool onward.  Dr Atherton emphasised that physical education and outdoor play must be built into the curriculum and into new school buildings, with Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales now pooling programmes to make activity attractive\u2014especially to girls and previously disengaged pupils.  Members pressed for clearer targets and funding; officials said \u00a38-\u00a310 million a year is likely, with existing health-board and sugar-levy monies reprioritised rather than hypothecated.\n\nSecond, COVID-19 forced an immediate re-purposing of schools.  From 23 March they would close to most pupils but stay open as local \u201chubs\u201d providing:  \n\u2022 childcare and informal learning for children of key workers;  \n\u2022 supervised places for vulnerable learners, including those on child-protection registers, young carers and some ALN pupils;  \n\u2022 continued free-school-meal provision.\n\nLocal authorities were already mapping which sites, staff and youth-work partners would operate, and head-teachers were told to attend on the first Monday to finalise rotas and distance-learning plans.  Welsh Government pledged that FSM support must run through closure and the Easter break\u2014whether via on-site meals, vouchers or deliveries\u2014and said EMA, childcare-offer and Flying-Start payments would continue even if learners or settings stay home.  Ministers also signalled that PE teachers and sports development officers may be redeployed into hub schools and that online resources on Hwb will include physical-activity ideas so pupils remain active while isolating.\n\nTogether, the strategic obesity agenda and the emergency pandemic measures aim to safeguard children\u2019s nutrition and activity levels during the crisis and beyond.",
    "User Interface pushed for a curved, bio-morphic keypad because the curve lets the body \u201cconform to the shape of the hand.\u201d With an arched underside, the joystick rests naturally on the heel of the palm while the thumb reaches the buttons, giving both right- and left-handers a comfortable, low-strain grip.  Beyond ergonomics, the curve was described as \u201csmall, stylish and a little different,\u201d helping the remote stand out in a market full of flat rectangles.\n\nWhen the team later scored the concept they quickly agreed on four attributes:\n\n\u2022 Easy to use \u2013 Only two hard keys plus a joystick drive an LCD menu, replacing the usual wall of buttons.  Combined with the hand-fitting shell, the interface felt simple even to visitors, so the group allotted high \u201cease-of-use\u201d marks.\n\n\u2022 Fashion \u2013 Real Reactions insists its electronics follow clothing and \u201cfruit & veg\u201d trends.  The banana-like curve, bright yellow colour and soft rubber skin meet that brief, so fashion received a strong score.\n\n\u2022 Easy to find \u2013 The same vivid yellow and rubber texture stop the remote from \u201ccamouflaging under any pile of crap in a living room,\u201d making it easier to locate when lost.  That practicality justified a high \u201ceasy to find\u201d rating.\n\n\u2022 Robust \u2013 A thick rubber over-mould gives a \u201cspongy, banana\u201d feel while protecting the electronics, so robustness also received top marks.\n\nDuring the fashion discussion User Interface led the vote. They reminded colleagues of management\u2019s fruit-and-veg directive, argued the banana shape was \u201cvery fashionable,\u201d and proposed the maximum fashion score.  Despite some initial hesitation from marketing, the team accepted UI\u2019s argument and recorded a seven for fashion style."
