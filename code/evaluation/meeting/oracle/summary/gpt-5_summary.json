    "- Use of English: The group agreed they had to move from German to English for the user-facing components. They converted the German sentence templates and lexicon (e.g., Spielfilm\u2192film/movie, Kino\u2192cinema, laufen\u2192run) and kept the parser\u2019s optional elements order-independent. They noted the parser could already parse English but needed more idiomatic phrasing (\u201cWhich films are playing at the cinema tonight?\u201d rather than \u201cWhich films are on the cinema today evening?\u201d). They planned to add new English sentence types and functions where needed, and to translate key ontology/database descriptions from German so reference resolution would work in English.\n\n- Data collection participants: The Professor asked to begin recruiting about 50 subjects immediately (starting with CogSci classes but not limited to students), using the already-approved consent form. He requested one change: add an explicit waiver option allowing subjects to decline reviewing the final transcript (otherwise they must be shown it, per the existing clause allowing excision). They also planned a short recruitment note, scheduling, and room logistics.\n\n- IBM computers: The group noted the new IBM multiprocessor Linux box had only two of the promised CPUs installed. The Professor\u2019s change request was operational: port and debug their code (especially neural-net training and HTK workflows) on this Linux system now, enable multithreading/parallel training, and sort out scripts so they\u2019re ready when IBM supplies the remaining processors. They also suggested checking Linux on existing machines (e.g., Swede, Fudge) for quicker wins.\n\nIn short: switch the system to idiomatic English (parser/templates/ontology summaries), recruit subjects using the consent form plus a new transcript-waiver option, and prepare/parallelize code on the IBM Linux hardware.",
    "The group framed decisions like Go-there and Endpoint (enter/view/approach) as belief-net nodes fed by four \u201cexperts\u201d: user (U), situation (S), discourse (D), and ontology/entity (E). They saw strong value in separating user and situation models so each can contribute compact, reusable evidence rather than dumping every feature directly into a single CPT. To keep models tractable, they proposed intermediate variables\u2014especially a \u201ccompatibility with action\u201d node that aggregates user state (money, time, energy/fatigue, schedule) and aligns it with action requirements; this can be reused across decisions.\n\nUser model:\n- Distinguishes a running User budget (a numeric, externally updated resource) from a User finance trait (cheap/average/spendy). Budget updates occur outside the BN and may trigger belief propagation either immediately or on demand.\n- Because decisions are discrete, the numeric budget should be mapped to decision-specific ranges/thresholds (e.g., admission fees). Thriftiness and admission costs together reduce the probability of \u201center.\u201d\n- A large interests vector (\u2248500 topics) motivates an externally computed \u201cfit\u201d node to express how well an entity matches the user\u2019s interests.\n\nSituation model:\n- Encodes temporally varying facts (open/closed, strikes, accessibility, whether the user has a base in town). These affect Go-there and Endpoint differently; for example, closed matters if \u201center\u201d is intended but not if \u201cview.\u201d\n- They noted the need to avoid loops; Endpoint can inform Go-there via an intermediate node.\n\nFor combining U/S/D/E, they favored weighted voting over full CPT specification, and discussed a mixture-of-experts (hidden selector) to vary weights by context. Overall, user and situation models are essential for realistic, context-sensitive decisions, provided they are abstracted into compact, reusable nodes to avoid combinatorial blow-up.",
    "Members repeatedly pressed the government on the state of the economy and transparency during the COVID\u201119 special sittings. Conservatives argued Ottawa was dodging accountability by refusing a fiscal/economic update, while ministers said unprecedented uncertainty made credible projections impossible and pointed to biweekly reporting on program costs instead.\n\nCathy McLeod\u2019s view: She was sharply critical of the government\u2019s refusal to table a fiscal update. She noted the economy was weakening even before COVID\u201119, revenues fell 7.2% in March, and Parliament had been sidelined by a \u201cquestion\u2011but\u2011no\u2011answer\u201d format. She contrasted Ottawa with provinces that have provided updates, and pressed for sector\u2011specific action\u2014particularly for forestry\u2014asking for an updated softwood lumber transition plan and faster support for struggling industries.\n\nMona Fortier\u2019s view: As Associate Minister of Finance, she emphasized that the Canadian economy was facing \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d that prevents producing reliable forecasts now. She maintained the government has been \u201copen and transparent,\u201d citing biweekly reports to Parliament on the total cost and status of measures, ongoing program adjustments (e.g., broadened wage subsidy access), and promised a comprehensive fiscal update once clear projections are possible.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste\u2011Marie\u2019s view: He focused on the conditions tied to emergency supports for large employers (LEEFF) and market fairness. He argued companies using tax havens should be excluded, urged rigorous case\u2011by\u2011case vetting of corporate tax structures before loans, and called for capping credit\u2011card interchange fees at 0.3% (in line with Europe/Australia) to protect merchants. He portrayed the government\u2019s stance as too permissive toward tax avoidance and insufficiently protective of taxpayers and small businesses.",
    "The industrial manager (industrial designer) highlighted the tiger\u2019s behavioral traits as the key qualities worth studying for the remote-control design. Specifically, he emphasized:\n\n- Methodical, well-thought action: The tiger \u201chunts for prey\u201d in a deliberate, carefully planned way. This underscores precision, intentionality, and an avoidance of unnecessary complexity\u2014valuing designs that do exactly what\u2019s needed with clarity and purpose.\n\n- Security-first mindset: He noted the tiger \u201calways goes for security,\u201d seeking a safe, advantageous position before acting. This points to reliability, risk reduction, and user confidence\u2014features that make interactions feel safe, predictable, and under control.\n\n- Stealth and concealment: By \u201cseeking a hide spot,\u201d the tiger uses concealment and positioning. Translated to product qualities, this suggests unobtrusive form, clean integration into environments, and controls that are accessible without being intrusive or confusing.\n\n- Focus and efficiency: Implicit in a planned hunt is conserving effort and maximizing impact\u2014favoring streamlined, efficient interactions over flashy but distracting elements.\n\nIn short, the characteristics singled out were the tiger\u2019s strategic, carefully planned behavior; its constant prioritization of security; and its use of stealth and advantageous positioning. These traits were proposed as guiding principles for a design that is purposeful, reliable, unobtrusive, and efficient\u2014prioritizing user certainty and effective, straightforward operation over showiness or unnecessary complexity.",
    "- Current interface (Transcriber + hacks): The team said the interface prevents detailed overlap annotation\u2014transcribers can\u2019t mark precise start/end times for each overlap. It displays only one waveform, and the Tcl/Tk graphics make loading and switching visual waveforms painfully slow. Switching audio between channels currently requires menu navigation, which is inefficient. Despite this, transcribers mainly rely on listening; visuals are secondary. Proposed near-term fixes: show only the mixed waveform with a UI to edit channel ribbons, add a fast \u201cclick-to-switch-audio\u201d control, and generate separate output files per channel to preserve overlaps and enable clean single-channel exports. Dan Ellis\u2019s hack allows choosing which channel to listen to (but still only one displayed waveform). Dave Gelbart volunteered to modify Transcriber accordingly.\n\n- Ideal/longer-term direction: Broad agreement that a \u201cmusical score\u201d style interface (multiple channels on a single timeline with precise overlap marking) would be best. Gelbart has concrete ideas to extend the interface toward this.\n\n- Alternative tools explored: An LMU Munich tool exists but is proprietary, unsupported, and considered error\u2011prone, so not usable. Susanne Burger (CMU) has an 8\u2011channel transcription tool the team would like to try; if it works, they\u2019ll arrange Windows machines. Praat (PRAAT) was considered but judged likely unsuitable for their specific needs.\n\n- Practical decision and timing: To keep data flowing, they will proceed with the existing setup using a coarse timescale for overlaps, while trying to land the improved overlap encoding \u201cthis week\u201d if possible. They noted they may not need a large, long\u2011term transcription operation if external transcripts arrive, but still want better tools for accurate overlap coding and channel\u2011separable outputs.",
    "Components design and remote components: Internals are standard\u2014PCB with IR LED, IC, battery, and switches. Company can supply off\u2011the\u2011shelf speakers/beepers for feedback and a \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d bleep. Button options included push\u2011buttons (company expertise), a scroll/spinning wheel (with integrated push), and an LCD (requires advanced IC). Power options discussed: standard AA battery (preferred for reliability/cost), kinetic backup (attractive but uncertain practicality), solar (conflicts with latex/rubber skins), and a docking/charging base as a differentiator.\n\nProperties and materials: Strong preference for a solid plastic body with soft rubber over\u2011mould/grips for drop resistance and hand feel; wood rejected; titanium considered \u201cchic\u201d but less aligned with sturdy, playful positioning and double\u2011curvature constraints. Case shape should be single/double\u2011curved, \u201cfruity\u201d and ergonomic; two\u2011tone colourways (case vs rubber pads/buttons).\n\nConceptual specifications of user interface and interface contents: Keep essentials as large physical controls: power, channel up/down, volume up/down; numbers and/or favourites/presets debated. Advanced functions via a simple menu: either on\u2011TV OSD navigated with arrows, or a small flip\u2011open LCD with a wheel (contentious on cost/fragility and design coherence). Secondary ideas: last\u2011channel toggle, parental control profiles/login, voice recognition (optional/secondary), spoken feedback.\n\nMarket findings and trend watching/market trends: Research ranked \u201cfancy look & feel\u201d first, technology second, ease of use third (some scepticism noted). Younger users favour soft, colourful, \u201cspongy\u201d materials; seniors prefer darker, traditional looks\u2014solution: removable/colour covers and dark variants. Year\u2019s themes: fruits/vegetables and tactile/spongy textures; use rounded \u201cfruity\u201d forms and catchy but not overbearing colours, while retaining brand colours. Overall, the direction balances fashion-forward appearance with simplicity, robustness, and tight cost (\u2248\u20ac25) constraints.",
    "Members heard that the early implementer areas are broadly successful and valuable precisely because they are pilots. Key lessons:\n\n- Administration: The biggest issue is the bureaucratic burden on councils and parents (eligibility checks, wage slips, birth certificates, changes in work patterns). This argues strongly for a single, centralised HMRC-style eligibility system with data sharing (e.g., DWP) to simplify access and reduce local workload; this is the Government\u2019s preferred approach under the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill.\n\n- Demand and geography: Demand is uneven across and within pilot areas for economic and cultural reasons (e.g., strong traditions of informal family childcare in some Valleys communities). Pilots also exposed \u201cboundary\u201d frustrations where only parts of an authority are included.\n\n- Capacity and workforce: No systemic capacity problems have emerged (including Welsh-medium and complex needs), but some areas face workforce shortages rather than space constraints. Pilots are helping map gaps, supported by a \u00a360m capital programme, a 10\u2011year workforce plan, co\u2011location with schools, and targeted Welsh\u2011medium expansion via Mudiad Meithrin.\n\n- Pricing and affordability: The \u00a34.50 hourly rate is widely welcomed and deliberately simpler than England\u2019s model, but high\u2011cost urban areas (Cardiff/Newport) will test whether a universal rate is viable; differential rates remain a possibility if evidence demands it. Providers may charge for food/transport/consumables, which will be monitored to avoid disadvantaging low\u2011income families.\n\n- Roll\u2011out approach: A phased expansion (e.g., Gwynedd, Anglesey, Caerphilly, Flintshire; RCT and Swansea next) is preferred to England\u2019s \u201cbig\u2011bang,\u201d reducing technical and volume risks and allowing continuous learning.\n\nOverall, the pilots are refining eligibility processes, communications with parents and providers, capacity planning (including Welsh\u2011medium growth), and the funding model ahead of full roll\u2011out by 2020.",
    "- Speech/voice recognition: The PM was skeptical from the start. After reviewing an in\u2011house \u201cspeaker/microphone\u201d module that only matched fixed phrases, he called it a fancy but pointless gimmick for interaction. He flagged major issues (training for many phrases, TV/background noise, multi\u2011language support, complexity) and repeatedly ruled ASR out for the prototype. When asked to add simple keyword spotting (\u201cvolume up\u201d), he said it was too difficult for this cycle; if anything, it might be revisited in later versions.\n\n- Cost constraints: He enforced a strict target (\u2248\u20ac25 retail, \u2248\u20ac12.5 production). Anything above made the project a no\u2011go. To stay within budget, he cut speech recognition and special colors, pushed customizable covers as paid extras, and favored in\u2011house, low\u2011risk components.\n\n- LCD incorporation: Initially hesitant due to space/cost, he later chose to keep the LCD and drop ASR. He saw the LCD as more valuable than speech recognition\u2014useful for menus/advanced settings (e.g., brightness, favorites) and potentially channel navigation\u2014though he admitted it wasn\u2019t yet perfectly leveraged.\n\n- Button design: He advocated minimal, easy controls: two scroll wheels (channel and volume) positioned for the thumb, a \u201cturbo\u201d option for rapid zapping, and just a few essential buttons (power, menu, OK). He supported avoiding number clutter, rounded ergonomics, and a \u201cspongy\u201d rubberized feel for durability and distinctiveness.\n\n- Overall technology stance: Pragmatic and user\u2011value driven\u2014favoring scroll wheels, a locator/beeper (with a base station), and TV\u2011only scope, while avoiding costly, immature, or internet\u2011dependent features that jeopardize budget or usability.",
    "- Recording conventions: The group agreed to standardize on close-talking, head\u2011mounted microphones rather than lapels, to reduce variability across speakers, improve recognition and prosody work, and make transcription easier. Placement guidance was specified (boom near the corner of the mouth, about a thumb to thumb\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half away, to avoid breath noise). They plan to buy several identical, more comfortable headsets and prefer uniformity over variety; broken channels will be fixed, and both wired and wireless are acceptable, with wireless expansion (additional base station, daisy\u2011chaining) under consideration. MultiTrans is being modified to support multi\u2011channel recordings with tighter time marks on overlaps; pre\u2011segmentation and channel\u2011energy cues will guide transcribers. Transcription conventions are being tightened (systematic handling of numbers and acronyms; tags like VOC, NONVOC, GLOSS), with an emphasis on reliability and compatibility with ATLAS.\n\n- On incorporating video: Interest was acknowledged, but the team decided not to add video now. Reasons included infrastructure and setup burden, increased human\u2011subjects/privacy concerns, likely participant reluctance, lack of an internal champion, storage/synchronization complexity (mirrored in similar concerns about microphone arrays), and a focus on impromptu scenarios that won\u2019t realistically have instrumented rooms. The consensus was that organizations like NIST/LDC are better positioned to manage video meeting corpora. They are open to collaborators who want to deploy video or arrays as a separate, unsynchronized setup in the same room and then export that data, but the core project will continue with audio\u2011only, standardized headsets and improved multi\u2011channel/time\u2011alignment tools.",
    "Project finance was framed by a target retail price of \u20ac25 and an overall profit goal of \u20ac50M. Early on, the team flagged likely cost issues and, lacking detailed cost data at the start, they later had to prune features to fit the financial criteria. During the finance review they walked through a component-cost sheet, debating how items (e.g., pushbuttons) were counted. To hit budget, they removed the pricey \u201csample speaker/sensor\u201d (calling it a gimmick) and replaced it with a simple beeper while keeping a locator function. They also dropped the scroll wheel in favor of volume up/down buttons to save cost, retained the LCD and voice recognition, and left headroom for potential color/finish upcharges. They joked about low-cost manufacturing but the substantive outcome was a configuration \u201cwell within budget,\u201d with even a small buffer for unforeseen items. In retrospectives, they noted the late arrival of cost information constrained creativity and recommended providing the cost sheet at project start; marketing was tasked to validate whether \u20ac25 matches market expectations.\n\nUse of the drawing board (whiteboard/Smart Board) was integral. The team trained on it early and used it continually to sketch form, UI layouts, a second-level sliding panel, teletext states, and button placement, saving the drawings as artifacts. They found it superior to static slides for rapid iteration, brainstorming, and capturing evolving decisions, and praised having both whiteboard and PowerPoint in the room. Suggestions included enabling mouse-based edits from seats. Overall, the drawing board materially improved collaboration and agility throughout the design discussions.",
    "- Industrial Designer\u2019s thinking during discussions:\n  - Prioritized practicality, ergonomics, and manufacturability. He argued for simple, reliable infrared over Bluetooth and initially accepted batteries as adequate; later explored kinetic power but remained cost-conscious.\n  - Focused on form and usability: a single curved body, good hand feel, color-separated key groups, and a slide-away second layer for less-used functions. He pushed ergonomic improvements and warned that replacing discrete keys with an integrated scroll-wheel would hurt ease-of-use.\n  - Sought a balanced \u201cfashion vs. innovation\u201d mix via special-form/fruit-themed buttons, while being willing to trade rubber casing for plastic to hit cost targets. Favored an LCD as more broadly useful than voice recognition, and ultimately questioned speech features due to integration complexity and ambient noise. He also suggested a simple locator concept to find a lost remote.\n\n- Project Manager\u2019s thinking during discussions:\n  - Set and reinforced constraints: \u20ac25 retail and production \u2264 \u20ac12.5, plus visible brand identity. Kept scope to a basic TV remote and pushed simplicity (infrared, battery power) unless strong justification.\n  - Continuously reconciled features with the cost model, highlighting trade-offs (e.g., if speech stays, downgrade materials/colors; plastic casing saves ~2 units vs. rubber). Drove structured evaluation against criteria and insisted decisions reflect marketing data.\n\n- PM\u2019s conclusions from team presentations:\n  - Proceed with a basic, ergonomic TV remote aligned to Real Reaction\u2019s look; prefer infrared and (initially) batteries; consider a lock/flip and a finder function.\n  - To meet cost: use a plastic case, limit special colors/materials, and keep only the most value-adding innovation (LCD and/or kinetic power), not the full set. The prototype largely met goals but needed cost-down adjustments and usability refinements to balance \u201cfancy\u201d appeal with clarity.",
    "- Decision on the base: The team weighed a small, battery-powered remote versus a larger unit with a charging base. They concluded that a dock would feel clunky and irritate users if the remote were compact, so they chose a smaller, stand\u2011free design with a locator feature to mitigate loss. For power they rejected solar (incompatible with soft covers) and kinetic/dynamo (user effort), and selected a single lithium cell for light weight. Separately, when \u201cbase\u201d meant the product\u2019s base finish, they chose a gun\u2011metal gray plastic body (with optional bright-yellow branding accents).\n\n- Fashionability evaluation: \u201cFashionable\u201d was one of their formal criteria (along with ease of use, feel, and tech innovation). In the quick 7\u2011point rating of the clay prototype, fashion scored low (it was only a rough model), but they aligned on a look that blends sleek, simple, iPod\u2011like cues with trend-aware options. They rejected heavy fruit/vegetable patterns as too faddish, opting instead for an ergonomic, organic form, limited tasteful color accents, full-body illumination on press, and interchangeable latex covers so trends (e.g., cherries) can be offered without locking the core product into a gimmick.\n\n- Pros and cons of existing remotes: They disliked LCD remotes as costly, potentially confusing, and unnecessary (users don\u2019t look at the remote while watching TV). Oversized models were deemed gimmicky, though tactile/raised symbols were a plus. Side scrolls are familiar but risk accidental activation; the team proposed side-mounted up/down controls that must be depressed to engage and be clearly labeled. Child covers that fall off were noted as a flaw; voice control for commands was seen as complex, but a voice/whistle-style finder was acceptable.",
    "- Environment-friendly material: The team proposed using shape-memory alloys for fast end-of-life disassembly (heat to release fasteners), enabling reuse/recycling via a take-back program. They weighed costs against a 100% turnover target. For power, solar was deemed impractical indoors; kinetic/dynamo ideas were intriguing but potentially inconvenient; batteries remain likely, with energy-saving features.\n\n- Current trend: Market and fashion-watch inputs said \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d will dominate over pure functionality, with a fruit-and-vegetable theme and spongy/tactile finishes trending. Some worried about short-lived fads and advised balancing trendiness with longevity and broad appeal.\n\n- Potential materials: Options included hard plastic, rubber/latex over a rigid shell, wood, and titanium. A titanium back/plastic front was discussed, but double curvature and weight/cost concerns (and one warning that titanium suits flat cases) made plastic with metallic finishes more feasible.\n\n- LCD screen: Pros\u2014supports menus, reduces button clutter, trendy. Cons\u2014needs an advanced chip, adds cost/power, small/readability issues. Alternative was on-TV menus controlled by few buttons/scroll; teletext was dropped as outdated/internationally inconsistent. Speech recognition was rejected for cost/noise/limited utility.\n\n- Color: Bright/primary \u201cfruity\u201d colors, mismatched accents accepted, and interchangeable fronts/covers (iPod/phone style). Company logo present; silver/yellow considered for base.\n\n- Spongy material: Favor a thin latex/rubber overmold (stress-ball-like grip) on a hard inner case; possibility of swappable squishy sleeves themed by fruits/vegetables, avoiding childish looks.\n\n- Material/function trade-offs: Strong look vs soft touch; curved ergonomics; minimize buttons for ease while keeping durability (embossed/tactile, timed backlighting vs glow-in-the-dark).\n\n- Questionnaire: 7\u2011point scale on features, innovation (LCD vs speech), fancy look, ease. Results suggested moderate success on \u201cfashion in electronics,\u201d constrained by budget; prior research showed users pay more for aesthetic appeal, while high voice-recognition interest wasn\u2019t pursued.",
    "Introduction of the prototype(s):\n- The Project Manager opened by fixing a strict unit cost target (12.50\u20ac) and framing evaluation. Two concepts were shown. The User Interface lead introduced a basic, TV\u2011only remote (~8\u20ac) with a conventional keypad and a second \u201csmooth\u201d concept (~16\u20ac) with only six multifunction keys, an LCD that indicates mode, a device-toggle, a power key, channel/volume controls, a microphone for speech recognition, and a small LED for battery/locator feedback, plus a protective cover. The Industrial Designer emphasized distinctive forms to convey \u201csurfing\u201d (surfboard shape) and later presented a banana-shaped, rubberized, \u201cspongy\u201d model with iPod\u2011like scroll navigation, ergonomic grip, and bright color for visibility.\n\nMulti\u2011functional vs single\u2011functional:\n- The group converged on a single\u2011function, TV\u2011only remote. Reasons: simplicity and ease of use; lower learning burden; better cross\u2011brand compatibility; and, crucially, cost/complexity\u2014multi\u2011device control (TV/DVD/VCR) and teletext would push them over budget. Management also mandated dropping teletext and focusing on TV-only. A device-toggle idea was discussed early but abandoned.\n\nLower technological grades:\n- The basic remote scored low on innovation because it mirrored existing market products (\u201cno innovation\u201d). The more advanced features (LCD, speech recognition) were attractive but unaffordable within 12.50\u20ac. After cutting LCD and speech recognition to meet cost, the banana prototype earned only moderate tech marks (e.g., ~4) since remaining novelties (scroll wheel, lighting) were incremental, not breakthrough.\n\nLocator consideration:\n- \u201cFindability\u201d was treated as a requirement. Options explored included: a blinking LED that doubles as low\u2011battery/locator cue; a clap\u2011to\u2011beep or alarm; a two\u2011piece beeper (adhesive tag on the TV plus a responder in the remote); a TV \u201cbeeper\u201d button; and visual aids (bright yellow case, glow\u2011in\u2011the\u2011dark or timed backlit buttons). Voice\u2011calling the remote via speech recognition was noted but deemed costly and noise\u2011sensitive. The team leaned toward low\u2011cost beeper/LED and high\u2011visibility materials.",
    "- Agreement between PhD A and PhD C on variance: They converged on using variance-based characterizations from the \u201cexcitation\u201d (FFT minus smoothed mel-filter spectrum) to help separate voiced vs. unvoiced frames. PhD A showed that the feature\u2019s means differ (\u22480.30 unvoiced vs. \u22480.59 voiced) but with substantial overlap; it appears robust to noise. PhD C agreed it is promising but cautioned that the ground-truth (TIMIT canonical phone mappings) could inflate variance and blur separability. Both agreed not to rely on simple mean/variance thresholds or log-domain normalization; instead, examine full distributions (histograms), try alternative statistical characterizations of the difference between raw and smoothed spectra, and evaluate them in a trained model (e.g., NN or as added features in the recognizer) rather than assuming Gaussianity.\n\n- Discussion with Jose: Jose reported large variation across overlap types; energy is not consistently higher during overlap, and log-energy compresses differences. He and the group agreed to: (1) start with simple, unnormalized linear-energy histograms for single vs. overlap, (2) systematically vary window sizes and normalization domains (avoid subtract/divide in the log domain by default), (3) explore CDF/PDF approaches without normality assumptions, and (4) prioritize pitch/harmonicity features as likely stronger indicators. They also discussed labeling specific overlap classes (e.g., short backchannels) and possibly analyzing clean two-speaker subsets.\n\n- Problems/difficulties due to overlaps: Overlap phenomena are heterogeneous (backchannels vs. competitive talk), causing heavy distributional overlap and weak separability by energy alone. Log compression, crude gain normalization, and ill-chosen window lengths obscure cues. Short backchannels are easily washed out by long normalization windows. Reliable analysis depends on accurate time marks/forced alignment; current segmentation sometimes splits words or mixes channels. Equipment/breath noise and speaker loudness differences further confound features. Overall, success likely requires better features (pitch/harmonicity), tailored normalization, and curated overlap labels.",
    "The team flagged new latency introduced by the denoising front end, specifically the smoothed spectral-subtraction stage. To stabilize the time-varying gain and reduce musical noise, the method uses a centered recursion that looks ahead into future frames. That future look-ahead creates added delay; the presenter confirmed a look-ahead of about \u201cfive-zero,\u201d i.e., roughly 50 ms. Related pieces also impose delay: initial noise estimation that uses the first 10\u201320 frames of an utterance (\u2248100\u2013200 ms), and transport/scheduling that bundles audio into super-frames (e.g., 24 frames), making the first frame in a bundle incur \u224824-frame latency (~240 ms) while the last has essentially none.\n\nThe professor\u2019s issue was not with the idea of smoothing per se, but with the cumulative impact of latency on an interactive system (SmartKom). He warned that if they ignore latency now, they may be forced later to \u201ccut the latency in half,\u201d creating a late-stage crunch. He urged being conservative: minimize added look-ahead where possible (e.g., prefer past-only processing even if it costs ~3% relative accuracy), and consider system-level strategies (buffering so latencies are not additive, or two-pass recognition: fast first pass with short context, then a very fast second pass using longer-context features on a small N-best/lattice).\n\nDurations mentioned:\n- Smoothing look-ahead: ~50 ms (centered recursion).\n- Noise-estimate warm-up: 10\u201320 frames (~100\u2013200 ms).\n- Super-frame buffering: up to 24 frames for the earliest frame (~240 ms, variable within the bundle).\nOverall, the concern is keeping end-to-end interaction responsive while balancing accuracy gains from longer temporal context.",
    "- Ergonomic, hand-friendly form factor: The case was specified with an ergonomic shape to sit comfortably in the hand. The device was intentionally given some heft so it doesn\u2019t feel flimsy, improving perceived control and quality.\n\n- Customizable wooden enclosure: Wood was chosen for the case, with color achieved via stain. Advantage: a warm, premium feel and easy aesthetic personalization without tooling changes.\n\n- Flip-panel with integrated LCD (yellow display): An LCD screen is placed under a flip cover. Advantage: provides visual feedback and richer controls when needed, yet remains hidden for simplicity; it is also modular\u2014if cost proves too high, it can be omitted without redesigning the whole remote.\n\n- Clear, accessible control layout: A large, highly visible yellow on/off button makes power easy to find. A dark\u2011blue numeric keypad sits at the bottom for quick entry. Menu controls are grouped on the right; a dedicated control on the left toggles voice recognition. Advantage: spatial grouping accelerates learning and supports quick, eyes-off operation; the voice toggle gives users privacy and avoids accidental activation.\n\n- Built-in voice recognition with always-available mic: The microphone should be placed on the top/side (not under the flip) so voice can be used even when the remote is closed or not in hand. Advantage: true hands\u2011free use (e.g., when hands are occupied), aligning with the key differentiator.\n\n- Personalizable surfaces: Custom back plates (and potentially the flip front) allow user or brand customization, subject to PCB clearance. Advantage: differentiation and user affinity.\n\n- Tactile button design: \u201cEgg-shaped\u201d buttons considered for better feel and identification by touch (with a note on cost trade\u2011offs). Advantage: enhances usability without relying solely on sight.",
    "Presentation: The team showed a modular remote-control prototype offered in two versions: (1) with an LCD and (2) without. Both versions shared a minimalist hardware layout built around a single 360-degree \u201cjoystick\u201d button (with click/double-click) for navigation/selection, a side microphone for optional speech-recognition, and a small on/off switch for that feature. Power came from a single rechargeable AA cell; charging was via a simple dock/phone-style charger. A beeper/\u201cmisplacement reminder\u201d and message prompt encouraged returning the unit to the charger. The industrial design emphasized robustness (a silver/titanium-like shell) with discussion of later spongy/soft-touch skins; add-on modules were proposed for parental controls and an elderly-friendly big-button face.\n\nDiscussion: Costs for the fully loaded configuration were estimated at about $15 (above the ~\u20ac12.5 target), with rough breakdowns: base unit ~$4, LCD ~$2, speech/mic ~$2, parental/other modules ~$2, charger ~$3. Marketing stressed that buyers value fancy, colorful, spongy looks more than tech add-ons, and that removing the LCD would free shape/finish options and reduce cost. The team debated detachable modules (flexible, upgradable, keeps customers returning) versus integrating everything (avoids lost parts); the PM favored integration for reliability, while others liked modularity. Fanciness was self-rated around 3 (with LCD) and 4 (without); innovativeness was judged high in both; ease-of-use scored 6 due to the few-button approach.\n\nConclusion: Proceed with the simpler, LCD-free version to hit cost and improve form freedom; keep speech recognition as an optional/deferred module. Maintain the core appearance as a robust, titanium-looking body with potential spongy/fruit-themed skins later, and refine the second (alternative button) layout. Focus next on aesthetics, cost optimization, and finalizing the dock/locator.",
    "- Touch screen: Initially floated as a marquee feature (and later revisited), but an internal cost estimate put it at about \u20ac17.50 per unit versus a target build cost under ~\u20ac12.50. It also raised power demands. The team concluded to drop the touch screen for the first model, positioning voice recognition (which they already have in-house) as the premium feature instead. They left open the option to revisit touch screens in a later version.\n\n- Flip screen / flip top: Early UI concepts proposed a flip-up panel to prevent accidental presses, optionally host a small LCD, and lock controls when closed\u2014useful around kids. They noted weight implications (especially with earlier wood-case ideas). In later discussions, with the touchscreen removed, they kept the flip/slide-out idea as a low-cost way to hide advanced functions while keeping the top surface simple.\n\n- Batteries and power: They debated AAA (bulky) vs coin cells, and considered a rechargeable pack with a cradle (phone-style) to avoid frequent replacements. For low-cost \u201cfind me\u201d functionality they preferred a TV-mounted beep trigger over pricier options. A battery-life indicator LED was proposed. Later they explored solar plus a small backup cell (basement scenarios noted), and briefly kinetic harvesting (likely insufficient for a touch display). Lithium availability was constrained by the current manufacturer.\n\n- General functionality under budget: Keep it TV-only, simple primary controls (power, channel, volume), rubber buttons for durability, and minimal on-device complexity; advanced functions live under the flip/slide panel. A small LCD was treated as optional and subject to cost-benefit (the TV itself is the main display). Voice recognition remains the distinctive, marketable feature within budget.",
    "The Government says it has embedded the key lessons from the three\u2011year Schools Challenge Cymru (SCC) into its wider school\u2011improvement system. Core takeaways include: the primacy of strong, capable leadership; robust systems for individual pupil tracking and data\u2011driven processes; a consistent focus on pedagogy and teaching quality; and collaborative, school\u2011to\u2011school working within a self\u2011improving system. It has also invested in lasting capacity, transferring many of SCC\u2019s strongest advisers into the regional consortia and strengthening regional improvement functions.\n\nProgression is now delivered through the national categorisation model rather than a standalone SCC programme. Improvement boards established under SCC have been retained. Support is targeted by need across all schools (including primaries), not just the original 39 secondaries. \u201cRed\u201d schools are entitled to up to 25 days of regional support\u2014more than the c.20 days SCC provided\u2014allowing intensive intervention where warranted. Government cites sustained improvements in some former SCC schools (e.g., Tredegar moving to \u201cgreen\u201d status and Eastern High coming out of special measures), while acknowledging that SCC had less impact in some settings; those schools are now being supported through the strengthened regional model.\n\nAlthough SCC was always time\u2011limited, Ministers emphasise its legacy: over \u00a310 million invested in regional school\u2011improvement capacity, continuity of effective personnel, and the mainstreaming of SCC practices into the national mission. Some early tensions between SCC activity and consortia roles were reported but are said to have been resolved as the system transitioned. The current focus is a whole\u2011system approach\u2014using categorisation, leadership development, rigorous tracking, and collaboration\u2014to sustain gains where SCC worked well and to intensify support where it did not.",
    "Dr. David Blaney views Brexit chiefly as a source of significant uncertainty that risks the higher education system\u2019s capacity to deliver for Wales. He notes early, tangible effects: a fall in EU-domiciled applications to Welsh universities and anecdotal signs that Welsh/UK institutions are finding it harder to join EU-funded research consortia as partners question UK stability during the transition. Given universities\u2019 exposure to EU-derived income (students, research, structural funds), he anticipates turbulence, with the eventual scale depending on UK\u2013EU outcomes and UK\u2013Welsh Government funding decisions.\n\nOn the 8\u20139% drop in EU applications to Wales (contrasting with growth in England), Blaney points to two main factors. First, the change to student support for EU students in Wales\u2014moving from receiving a grant to needing a full-fee loan\u2014has likely caused a short-term perturbation; he hopes this is temporary and stresses the Welsh offer is at least as good as England\u2019s and slightly better on fee levels. Second, in a highly competitive market, visible investment matters: long-standing lower capital investment in parts of the Welsh estate may make some campuses appear less attractive. He also cites Wales\u2019s smaller share of high-tariff, globally prominent institutions and the Anglocentric UK media limiting Wales\u2019s visibility; perceptions of welcome can influence international demand.\n\nAs to why study in Wales, Blaney highlights: a UK-quality degree in a setting perceived by international students and parents as safer and more supportive, with smaller, more manageable cities; slightly lower fees than England; and a strengthened, sector-led \u201cStudy in Wales\u201d offer that markets these advantages internationally.",
    "Mental-space domains. The group treats mental spaces as small \u201cworlds\u201d built by space builders in the utterance and context. Core domains:\n- Time: deictic \u201cnow,\u201d \u201cpast,\u201d \u201cfuture\u201d (past as a conventional space builder relative to speech time).\n- Space: deictic \u201chere/there,\u201d locations like \u201cin France,\u201d with relations to the event\u2019s place.\n- Person/indexicals: speaker, hearer, logophoric shifts (e.g., reported speech, ASL role shift).\n- Modality/attitude: belief, desire, counterfactual/conditional (\u201cif,\u201d \u201cwould\u201d), factivity/evidentiality.\n- Discourse context/accessibility: active/accessible referents; retrieval from context is handled with the same accessibility/mapping machinery as other spaces.\nEach utterance selects a base space and may open embedded spaces; pronouns, tense, and reference are interpreted relative to the current base. Spaces are connected by mappings/identifications (sometimes partial), allowing blends when needed.\n\nMiddle layer function. In the tourist domain Bayes net, the middle layer consists of hidden conceptual variables that mediate between observed features and the output \u201cmode\u201d (Enter/Tango/Vista). It captures plans/roles such as:\n- Tourist vs doing-business/errand\n- In-a-hurry vs leisurely\n- Has-final-destination vs meandering\n- Intends-to-enter (optional), etc.\nInputs come from multiple observable regions: discourse cues (e.g., admission-fee talk), parse/lexicon (verb class), prosody (tense/relaxed), context (time of day), and ontology (enterable/has-door, landmark properties). Optionally, each region can have its own sub\u2013middle layer that aggregates its cues before feeding the task-level middle layer. This design (a) reduces CPT explosion and supports learning, (b) implements plan recognition by letting many weak cues add up, and (c) allows discourse-history updates over turns. Strongly diagnostic cues can still connect directly to the output if justified.",
    "On the back-end: He felt the in-house back-end was too simple and that prior attempts to tune it hadn\u2019t helped enough. He pointed out that SRI\u2019s system benefits greatly from online, unsupervised adaptation and large training sets, and suggested pushing our tandem features through SRI\u2019s stronger HMM/decoder to see immediate gains\u2014even before any major retraining. Longer term, he argued that results people will take seriously (e.g., on digits) require a stronger back-end and much more training data, so either retrain with far larger datasets or leverage a proven back-end with adaptation.\n\nOn storing data: He wanted to save everything we record\u2014e.g., all far-field channels from the SmartKom sessions\u2014so others can use it for acoustic studies, provided we have the disk space. Organizationally, he supported using the same infrastructure and tools for convenience, but clearly separating it from the \u201cmeeting\u201d corpus in naming/directories and description; reading digits and human\u2013computer dialogues shouldn\u2019t be labeled as \u201cmeetings\u201d in distributions, even if they live under the same tree internally.\n\nOn storage mechanics, he advocated practical, scalable steps: buy more disk (it\u2019s cheap) and, if needed, another file server; keep bulk audio on non\u2013backed-up volumes and perform a one-time tape archive to avoid overloading nightly backups; use the existing tape robot/NW-archive workflow; place rarely accessed data on the older server and high-traffic data on a faster new file server. He discouraged relying on CD/DVD due to media degradation and warned that administrative operations (chmod/chown) can inadvertently force re-backups.",
    "- Seniors care crisis: MPs cited the Canadian Armed Forces\u2019 reports of neglect and unsafe practices in Ontario and Quebec long\u2011term care (LTC) homes, calling it a national crisis. The NDP pressed for federal leadership, national LTC standards, and removing profit from care. The Prime Minister and Health Minister acknowledged the failures, highlighted CAF deployments and federal funding, and said Ottawa would work with provinces to improve care, but emphasized provincial jurisdiction and stopped short of committing to a federal takeover, Canada Health Act coverage, or a ban on for\u2011profit LTC.\n\n- Racism and LTC/government policy: Members raised systemic anti\u2011Black and anti\u2011Indigenous racism, urging race\u2011based COVID data, an RCMP use\u2011of\u2011force review, and bans on carding. The government affirmed systemic racism exists, committed to disaggregated data and opposition to racial profiling, and said it would work with provinces and police services. No specific linkage or policy tying racism to LTC was proposed; the two issues were addressed in parallel.\n\n- Protecting workers\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 rights: The NDP sought super\u2011priority for pensions, severance and benefits in insolvency. Government pointed to 2019 Bankruptcy/CCAA changes (more transparency, ability to set aside executive bonuses) but made no new commitment to elevate pensioner claims.\n\n- Hon. Lawrence MacAulay on veterans\u2019 policy debate: He welcomed public engagement by veterans and families on policies and programs, said the government is open to input, and reiterated the goal of providing the best possible compensation and supports, while noting veterans can never be fully compensated for their service.\n\n- Minister of Seniors on pandemic assistance: The government announced a one\u2011time, tax\u2011free payment of $300 (OAS) plus $200 (GIS) for eligible seniors\u2014$500 for those receiving both\u2014on top of the GST credit top\u2011up and support via the New Horizons program. She acknowledged seniors\u2019 added costs (e.g., dispensing fees, deliveries), said total senior aid exceeds platform commitments, and indicated further work was ongoing, including for persons with disabilities.",
    "They clashed because each role optimized for different priorities under shifting, sometimes unclear requirements.\n\n- Parental control: Marketing promoted it as a headline differentiator (\u201ctake parental control to a new dimension\u201d). The Project Manager (PM) accepted the market appeal but insisted it be fast, optional, and simple at start-up to avoid user friction. The Industrial Designer (ID) questioned whether the development effort and technical complexity (where to enforce control, how to log in, constant signaling) justified the benefit and even suggested a separate device\u2014creating scope and cost tension.\n\n- Shape and materials: Marketing pushed \u201cfruity,\u201d soft, trendy forms and removable covers; PM worried about added cost and manufacturability, and later pressed for simpler single-curve options. ID weighed ergonomics (thumb reach, left/right-handed use), durability, and feasibility (double-curve, flip-up screen) and warned rubber can look \u201ccheap\u201d even if protective.\n\n- Color/branding: Marketing favored a dark-blue base with bright accents; PM wanted strong brand recognition (even \u201cyellow\u201d cues). ID cautioned that multiple color options increase cost.\n\n- Front controls: Marketing wanted a sleek look (flat/hidden buttons). PM argued for fewer, obvious TV-only controls to meet time-to-market and cost (no LCD, no speech). ID explored scroll wheels, concave buttons, backlighting, and flip-up LCDs for advanced functions\u2014raising complexity and chipset requirements.\n\n- Wireless/technical choices: ID briefly entertained wired control for cost; PM and Marketing rejected it as unappealing. They also debated infrared, voice recognition (Marketing liked the novelty; PM flagged cost/timeline; ID cited feasibility), and power (battery vs kinetic vs solar), again trading off innovation vs reliability, cost, and size.\n\nIn short, disagreements arose from role-driven trade-offs\u2014market differentiation and style (Marketing), simplicity, cost, and schedule (PM), and ergonomics, robustness, and feasibility (ID)\u2014amid evolving scope and incomplete cost data.",
    "Marketing structured the evaluations as group scoring exercises grounded in sales goals and user research. They proposed shortlists of measurable criteria, had the team rate each concept on numeric scales (first a simple 1\u20135 style average, later a 1\u20137 scale where 1 = true/positive and 7 = false/negative), and then averaged the scores to compare alternatives and guide feature decisions.\n\nThe specific criteria they brought forward included:\n- Look and feel/fanciness: aesthetic appeal, form, materials, and tactile \u201cspongy\u201d feel.\n- Innovation: presence of novel features (e.g., LCD, speech recognition, find\u2011my\u2011remote/locator), not just cosmetic design.\n- Ease of use and learnability: simplicity for new users, avoiding clutter, clarity of controls.\n- Functional completeness and usefulness: the right functions without too many; whether teletext, subtitles, channel entry, etc., are covered logically.\n- Fit to the target demographic (20\u201340): whether features and styling appeal to that audience.\n- Alignment with company motto/brand and fashion trends: recognisable corporate image (logo/colours), \u201cfashion in electronics,\u201d and the fruit/vegetable trend with interchangeable covers.\n- Cost/feasibility: staying within the \u20ac12.50 build target (and ~\u20ac25 retail), testing whether features like an LCD or advanced chips could be afforded.\n- Ergonomics/RSI: comfort, grip, one\u2011handed operation, material choices to reduce strain.\n- Findability when lost: options like LEDs, alarms/\u201cscreaming,\u201d or locator aids.\n- Willingness to pay: whether the concept would justify the \u20ac25 price point.\n\nUsing these criteria and averaged scores, Marketing steered decisions such as dropping the LCD and speech recognition to hit cost, while keeping design/brand appeal and ease of use central.",
    "- Transcription: Active and expanding. Five meetings in the initial \u201cset one\u201d are done; staff was thinned by attrition but two new transcribers were hired with a third planned, keeping a lean team of about five to six. Workflows now include automatic segmentation cues (beep\u2013digit\u2013beep), and Thilo\u2019s segmenter is being used to move off hand-segmentations. A status spreadsheet (date, speakers, duration, completion) is being compiled for the Meeting Recorder web page. About 11 hours have been fully transcribed and are being cleaned, channelized, and normalized (numbers, acronyms, nonspeech tags). A bleep/approval process is being set up: participants will review transcripts and can request excisions; email approvals are acceptable, with passworded web access available when needed.\n\n- Recordings: Ongoing and sizable. One report lists approximately 62 hours collected as of the 14th; another later update cites roughly 32\u201335 hours (including digits). Additional meetings (ICSI groups, front\u2011end meetings, others) are being added; a 45\u2011minute gold set and ~10 hours are being packaged for IBM transcription. Goal is to be in \u201cproduction mode\u201d by the July DARPA meeting.\n\n- Intermediate categories and the SPG schema: The SPG (Source\u2013Path\u2013Goal) design is drafted but not finalized. An \u201caction schema\u201d layer (e.g., Enter/View/Approach) will sit alongside an SPG image\u2011schema instantiation, with explicit cross\u2011links (IDs/XPath) to bind roles (e.g., Enter\u2019s goal to SPG\u2019s Goal). Multiple schemas per utterance are allowed (e.g., SPG travel plus a commercial \u201cbuying\u201d schema). Constraints (e.g., via XForms) are envisioned; enforcement is not yet mandatory. There is an open design question about organizing categories \u201cunder SPG\u201d versus \u201cunder action,\u201d and XML examples were promised for the next meeting. The aim is a rich action description (RAD) that can support intention-level inferences without forcing phrasings.",
    "- Duty to promote public awareness (Group 1): The Deputy Minister tabled amendments 1 and 4 to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and raise awareness of the change in law abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. She confirmed a high\u2011intensity, six\u2011year awareness programme from Royal Assent. She asked Members to reject amendments 1A\u20131E, arguing they were unnecessary or overly prescriptive: naming specific audiences (e.g., visitors) could skew priorities; adding \u201cunderstanding\u201d adds nothing beyond \u201cawareness\u201d; specifying content (parenting support, how to report concerns) should be developed by the expert stakeholder and parenting groups, not fixed on the face of the Bill; children\u2019s awareness is already addressed through Ministers\u2019 existing due\u2011regard duty to children\u2019s rights; safeguarding remains \u201ceveryone\u2019s business.\u201d\n\n- Reporting on the effect of the legislation (Group 2): Through amendment 2 (and 5), she put a statutory post\u2011implementation review duty on the face of the Bill, describing a continuous programme after commencement: regular attitudinal surveys and a task\u2011and\u2011finish group to establish robust data capture and assess service impacts. She opposed amendments requiring a pre\u2011commencement evaluation of the awareness campaign, citing the need for certainty on the commencement date and existing plans to assess effectiveness. She agreed to consider at Stage 3 changing \u201cpublish\u201d to \u201clay before the Assembly,\u201d to consult the committee on the scope, and to explore an interim report before the five\u2011year post\u2011commencement report; she will also update the EM and RIA.\n\n- Regulation\u2011making powers/commencement (Groups 3 and related): Because she fixed commencement at two years after Royal Assent (amendment 7), she re\u2011inserted a technical power (amendments 3 and 6) to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions for section 1\u2019s coming into force. She said wider regulation\u2011making powers were unnecessary, noted CLAC\u2019s view that no Assembly procedure was appropriate, but agreed to keep this under review and discuss ahead of Stage 3.",
    "- Long\u2011term trends in standards and attainment: Ministers acknowledged trend-tracking is harder because performance measures have been deliberately changed to curb gaming and refocus on learners\u2019 interests. Progress is now judged through a broader evidence set: Estyn reports, evolving school categorisation (used as risk/triage, not league tables), national exam data, PISA, and new interim measures such as capped 9 and the \u201cthird\u2011third\u2011third\u201d analysis to ensure all learners count (not just C/D borderliners). A stronger culture of self\u2011evaluation is being built via the National Evaluation and Improvement Resource, co\u2011constructed with Estyn, OECD and practitioners. For schools causing concern\u2014especially in the secondary sector\u2014the Government is piloting a multi\u2011agency model (school, LA, consortium, Estyn, WG) to intervene earlier, track fundamentals (leadership, T&L), and secure sustainable, not \u201cquick\u2011win,\u201d improvement.\n\n- Role of Qualifications Wales (per Philip Blaker): QW is the independent regulator. It approves qualification specifications and sample assessments, regulates awarding bodies (e.g., WJEC), and safeguards fairness in grading\u2014especially during change\u2014through prescribed awarding methods such as comparable outcomes. QW also scrutinises reform timelines to ensure system readiness, aiming to avoid compressed schedules that previously hindered resource and implementation timetables. Strategically, QW is exploring a shift from specification\u2011tied textbooks toward broader curriculum resources.\n\n- Timescales for addressing the lack of exams: On QW\u2019s clear advice, the summer exam series is cancelled. Year 11 and 13 learners will receive fair grades based on a range of evidence (including existing externally assessed units and moderated centre input), with UK\u2011wide moderation to protect standards. WJEC/QW will issue detailed guidance to centres imminently, with an intention to keep to the usual August results timetable if operationally possible. Decisions on AS (Year 12) and some vocational/technical awards are being finalised, with a presumption to award where continuous assessment permits and to avoid disadvantaging progression.",
    "Members repeatedly highlighted that \u201cgood practice\u201d does not spread consistently across Wales. Variation stems from uneven leadership and self\u2011evaluation, differing regional consortia approaches, and inconsistent use of data and evaluation. Estyn reported that while strong schools share practice well, too many rely on short\u2011term fixes (e.g., KS4 catch\u2011up) rather than sustainable pedagogy, and many heads lack confidence with foundation phase principles. Good practice networks exist (e.g., foundation phase, maths/science), but coverage and impact vary. The \u201cmiddle tier\u201d (LAs/consortia) remains mixed: roles can blur, challenge/support balance differs by region, and some LAs underuse intervention powers. Community\u2011focused models and multi\u2011agency work are promising, yet not universal.\n\nImplications for childcare services mirror these disparities. Provision and take\u2011up vary by geography, historic LA decisions, and local demand; urban/rural costs and traditions (e.g., informal family care) compound differences. Welsh\u2011medium capacity is uneven, requiring targeted growth (new cylchoedd meithrin) and workforce upskilling. Joint CIW/Estyn inspections aim to secure quality across non\u2011maintained settings, but staffing (including Welsh language skills) is a constraint.\n\nDelivering the childcare offer at scale therefore needs:\n- Clear, consistent national frameworks with local delivery: co\u2011location of childcare and early education, aligned with WESPs, and capital to fill gaps.\n- A robust workforce plan (training, recruitment, Welsh language) and stronger evaluation to know what works and scale it.\n- Administration that reduces burden and ensures equity (centralised eligibility checks; vigilance on add\u2011on charges so low\u2011income working families aren\u2019t priced out).\n- Targeted support where costs are higher or capacity thinner, while preserving a simple, transparent core offer.\n\nWithout these, Wales will see continued postcode variation in access, quality, and language choice for families.",
    "The team aligned on components that are available now and feasible to manufacture. Electronics will use the standard TA11835 IR remote chip driving an IR LED, with silicone-based printed circuit boards. Two boards will be used (one per flip section) linked by wiring; a standby mode and optional button backlighting (auto-off after 5\u201310 seconds) were proposed to conserve power.\n\nPower options were reviewed extensively. AA/AAA cells were deemed bulky; a \u201cdynamo\u201d wind-up was rejected; solar charging was considered expensive, fragile, and unreliable under indoor light. The preferred solution is kinetic charging (as in automatic watches) feeding a small watch-style cell\u2014compact, low-draw, and realistic for intermittent remote use. No separate rechargeable pack is available or required under this approach.\n\nCase materials and finish: the factory can supply plastic housings and rubber components. Plastic was chosen for the main shell due to cost, durability, and freedom to mold non-boxy, curved forms compatible with a flip design. Titanium was rejected (cost, limited shapes, scuffing); wood was considered impractical. A removable rubber sleeve over the plastic body provides the \u201cspongy\u201d feel, grip, drop protection, and easy style refresh. Skins will ship in fruit/vegetable-inspired colors (not literal shapes), with scope for varied textures/patterns.\n\nInterface design: a flip form factor with a monochrome LCD touch GUI on the top half for configurable controls, and physical anti-RSI rubber buttons on the bottom half for frequent actions (volume/channel) in a familiar layout. A stylus is optional; finger use is primary.\n\nFinding the remote: a voice-response locator (\u201cWhere\u2019s the remote?\u201d) will be included if the company\u2019s in-house speech module is affordable; otherwise, a simpler beeper is the fallback. A docking/port alarm was discussed but not finalized.",
    "Final model: The professor emphasized that spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering are fundamentally the same family of noise-suppression methods, differing mainly by an exponent (power vs. signal-domain criteria). Many implementation choices matter as much or more\u2014FFT-bin vs. mel-band processing, time/frequency smoothing, and over-subtraction. The team converged on a single unified codebase with options, but he urged fixing one configuration for now (best so far: FFT-bin Wiener) and stabilizing the pipeline. Current performance is close to the previous best despite not explicitly handling stationary noise; improving VAD and noise estimation is next, with a later stage adding a neural-net feature transform. Latency/causality should be guided by standards (130\u2013250 ms budgets), but for now performance takes priority; future context can be curtailed if required.\n\nTime series and reverberation: The group discussed modeling multiple parallel temporal feature streams with factorial HMMs, which keep parameters manageable and permit simple Viterbi-style inference. For reverberation, they highlighted Avendano\u2019s modulation-spectrum approach: use long analysis windows (~2 s) so room response behaves like a convolution, then apply mean (DC) subtraction in the modulation domain and trade spectral for temporal resolution to produce recognizer-friendly features. They proposed extending this to time-varying room responses by estimating near\u2013table-mic impulse responses via block least-squares echo cancellation and tracking how fast they change.\n\nPronouncing zero: For digit data, the professor noted systems should allow both pronunciations\u2014\u201cO\u201d and \u201czero.\u201d Earlier collection sheets sometimes forced one, but the current design intentionally elicits natural usage; transcripts can mark \u201cOH\u201d when appropriate. This reflects real-world variation and should be modeled accordingly.",
    "The team agreed to introduce a fashion-forward but affordable universal remote with a clear emphasis on simplicity. Core concept decisions: power will combine a standard battery with kinetic recharging (shake/motion keeps it topped up); solar was rejected. The case will be double\u2011curved with a hard rubberized (non-bendable) exterior for grip and drop resistance, offered in flashy \u201cfruity\u201d colors with removable covers. To control cost, the interface will use pushbuttons and a simple chip (no LCD; no scroll wheel). A small, clean set of always-visible buttons will handle essentials (power, volume, channel up/down, favorites), while advanced settings (e.g., tuning, picture) will appear via an on\u2011screen menu.\n\nScope: the product will be a \u201clight\u201d universal remote able to switch between a few devices (e.g., TV, VCR/DVD, stereo/set\u2011top box), positioning below typical universal remotes on price but above bundled remotes on capability.\n\nParental control: included by default but optional to activate. The approach is profile-based (e.g., Parent, Child, Family) with quick access (simple code for adults), and restrictions by channel and/or time. No separate hardware add\u2011on; the functionality resides in the remote/TV interaction. Speed of use was emphasized so it doesn\u2019t delay normal viewing.\n\nGames: dropped. The group felt gaming on a remote adds complexity without supporting the viewing task.\n\nVoice recognition: considered attractive for marketing and youth appeal, but it will be strictly secondary. If included, it will be a lightweight, small\u2011vocabulary command set (e.g., on/off, digits, volume) and only if it doesn\u2019t significantly impact cost or reliability; ambient TV noise limits its practicality.\n\nOverall, the design balances trendy look-and-feel with straightforward, fast operation and restrained feature set.",
    "The committee probed two areas: possible rises in youth suicide during COVID-19 and sustained, equitable perinatal mental health care.\n\nOn youth suicide, Vaughan Gething acknowledged significant concern but said definitive conclusions can\u2019t be drawn yet. He has commissioned the Welsh Government Delivery Unit to work with the National Advisory Group (including Dr Ann John) to review unexpected deaths occurring at the start of the pandemic to detect any spike in suicides among children and young people. A report was expected by the end of the month, after which the Government would update the committee. He stressed that crisis care for children and young people remains an essential, available service, with CAMHS capacity monitored weekly (covering staff sickness, referrals, and demand) and currently assessed as able to meet need. Telephone and online supports have been expanded and GPs continue to signpost to services.\n\nOn long-term special care for pregnant women, Gething reiterated the Government\u2019s commitment to consistent perinatal mental health support across Wales and to protecting recent service improvements. Services have adapted to remote (phone/online) delivery where appropriate. He cautioned that work to create the previously committed in\u2011patient mother and baby unit capacity has been paused by the pandemic, potentially affecting timelines, but the commitment stands. He and the Chair noted a recent drop in mothers\u2019 willingness to use mother and baby units due to fear and lockdown constraints; Gething emphasized this reflects behavior during COVID-19, not reduced need, and will not be used to downscale planned capacity. He praised staff commitment and underscored that perinatal mental health remains a priority throughout and beyond the pandemic.",
    "- Implementation timeline and focus: The Strategic Delivery Group chaired by Prof. Dylan Jones has no fixed end date. It was set up about 18 months ago and is currently agreeing a plan with officials. Its purpose is to support the successful implementation of the new curriculum by clarifying roles and responsibilities across the \u201cmiddle tier.\u201d The Minister rejected any suggestion that the group might lose focus, saying it is very clear about eliminating duplication, setting clear demarcations, and ensuring partners can rely on each other.\n\n- Views on pursuing harder improvements: Ministers and officials stressed moving beyond \u201clow\u2011hanging fruit.\u201d The new multi\u2011agency approach for schools causing concern focuses on fundamentals (leadership, teaching and learning, governance), the school\u2019s capacity, and what extra support is needed, with a 6\u2011, 12\u2011, and 18\u2011month view to secure sustainable improvement. They also acknowledged that changing performance measures makes trend\u2011tracking harder, but insisted such changes are in learners\u2019 best interests (e.g., a notable rise in English literature entries) and are worth the added challenge.\n\n- PRU networking and transition arrangements: Witnesses reported markedly better networking within the PRU sector\u2014more professional learning, reciprocal visits, and sharing of expertise with mainstream schools, especially around the curriculum. On transitions, Swansea described phased reintegration from PRU to school (often via part\u2011time timetables), close joint working with schools, continued post\u2011return support tapered over time, and recognition that reintegration is hardest at Key Stage 4, where planning shifts toward FE/college pathways. Torfaen highlighted a \u201cteam\u2011around\u2011the\u2011family\u201d approach, tailoring wraparound support (including transport) to make reintegration viable. The overarching aim is coordinated, sustained support that avoids gaps where pupils can \u201cfall between\u201d services.",
    "- Infra-red functionality: The team endorsed infra-red as the transmission method for the remote, describing it as the best option and emphasizing that the IR link must be \u201creliable and clear\u201d so users aren\u2019t \u201cwaving the remote around\u201d or moving across the room to make it work. Making IR \u201cvery functional\u201d was set as a general requirement. They tied IR performance to practical design choices: strong battery life/power delivery, a chip that encodes and drives the IR signal cleanly, and overall component quality (no \u201cshoddy work\u201d). Long battery life was highlighted as a supporting requirement, and there was openness to ideas like charging cradles later, but the core was dependable IR signaling from good power and electronics.\n\n- Disposable income: When defining target users and pricing, the group noted that 15\u201325 year-olds often have relatively high disposable income due to fewer financial commitments (no mortgage, car, insurance), and that 25\u201335 year-olds are also attractive as they start jobs and buy \u201cnice toys.\u201d The proposed \u20ac25 retail price was considered affordable even for younger users. However, they also cautioned that some students may lack their own TVs or have older sets that could affect compatibility, so purchasing likelihood isn\u2019t solely about ability to pay. They discussed possibly defining the target more by spending power and desire for fashionable, simple products than by strict age bands, while keeping production within the ~\u20ac12.5 cost limit. Overall, they saw younger, style-conscious buyers with discretionary spend as prime, provided the product remains affordable, usable, and broadly compatible.",
    "- Using eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as a measure: The group regard FSM status as an imperfect but currently the best available proxy for socioeconomic need. They are exploring ways to refine it\u2014monitoring the impact of Universal Credit, considering moving away from a single January snapshot toward a more flexible, multi\u2011year approach (an \u201cEver 2\u201d style model), and consulting publicly before any change. They reject adopting \u201cEver 6\u201d now due to an estimated \u00a340m cost pressure. Guidance remains that PDG-funded individual interventions must target FSM\u2011eligible pupils, while whole\u2011school initiatives are acceptable only where evidence shows a disproportionate benefit for FSM learners.\n\n- PDG\u2019s impact on attendance and engagement for FSM pupils: They cite Estyn\u2019s evidence that attendance has improved overall, but a significant FSM\u2013non\u2011FSM gap persists. PDG is seen as a helpful lever that has \u201cconcentrated minds\u201d and enabled evidence\u2011based actions. Examples include:\n  - Primary: PDG\u2011funded \u201cwalking buses\u201d led by teaching assistants to get targeted pupils into school.\n  - Secondary: staff dedicated to working with families to tackle barriers; investment in school nurses and counsellors to coordinate with external agencies.\nThey note interventions grow harder with older pupils, and while permanent exclusion rates are not higher for FSM pupils, temporary exclusions are\u2014requiring multi\u2011agency responses (well\u2011being, behaviour, ALN support) alongside PDG. Challenge advisers are expected to scrutinise schools\u2019 PDG use and its measured impact on attendance/engagement, and new regional PDG advisers will spread effective practice.\n\nOverall, PDG is judged to make a positive, context\u2011dependent contribution to attendance and engagement for FSM learners, but it is not a standalone solution; closing the gap needs sustained, multi\u2011agency effort.",
    "On support vector machines (SVMs), the professor viewed them as a succinct, example-efficient alternative to more \u201cbrute force\u201d models like neural nets or Gaussian mixtures. He likened SVMs to a principled form of condensed nearest-neighbor: instead of comparing to all training tokens, they keep only the critical support vectors near decision boundaries, yielding a reduced parameterization that can generalize better with modest data. For speech recognition use, he noted that although SVMs are inherently margin/distance-based rather than probabilistic, it\u2019s feasible to convert SVM distances to posteriors (e.g., via a sigmoidal mapping or softmax-like calibration). He cited prior work from Mississippi State that did exactly this for speech recognition; their results were \u201cOK\u201d and interesting as a first attempt, but not breakthrough, and he was unsure whether rigorous large-task comparisons had established clear advantages.\n\nRegarding speech-rate algorithms, the transcripts contain no specific discussion or endorsement from the professor. His remarks in these meetings focused on feature design for voicing (e.g., energy, spectral slope like R1/R0, zero-crossing counts historically), leveraging filter-bank/log-magnitude spectra, and practical recognizer issues such as pruning thresholds and front-end differences (PLP vs. mel-cepstra). He also suggested letting learning methods ingest richer spectral inputs rather than handcrafting overly clever single statistics. But he did not articulate any views, methods, or evaluations specific to speech-rate estimation or speech-rate\u2013aware decoding in these sessions.",
    "The professor draws a clear line between real reverberation/echo artifacts and how to mitigate them, and he also distinguishes \u201cacoustic events\u201d from traditional linguistic features. On echoes and reverberation, he notes that some \u201cecho\u201d heard in re\u2011synthesized audio can be pre\u2011echo\u2013like artifacts introduced by non\u2011causal mean subtraction that averages over long windows (up to many seconds). This makes low\u2011energy regions especially vulnerable, because reverberation from high\u2011energy speech becomes most audible there. He cites earlier work showing that high\u2011pass filtering or operations that effectively suppress low\u2011energy portions (e.g., shifting and zeroing negatives, or a VAD\u2011like gate) can reduce the perceived reverberation without strictly adhering to an inversion equation. He advises a conservative strategy: if you must err, keep possible echoes rather than delete true speech. He also cautions that simple loudness increases should not help recognition unless they genuinely improve SNR; uniform gain changes in both train and test should be neutral.\n\nOn acoustic events, he favors bottom\u2011up, data\u2011measurable cues over top\u2011down, linguistically defined features. \u201cAcoustic events\u201d are salient signal happenings (e.g., onsets, rapid changes) that likely trigger neural responses and can be robustly detected. He encourages designing event detectors inspired by auditory processing (and informed by hearing\u2011aid research), potentially using probabilistic AND\u2011OR structures, and exploring phenomena like co\u2011modulation release. The idea is to develop reliable event detectors whose outputs can be fed into a recognizer (e.g., SRI) and evaluated in clean and noisy conditions, providing a pragmatic, signal\u2011driven complement to conventional feature sets.",
    "The team aligned on a \u201csimple, innovative, and easy-to-use\u201d UI, prioritizing long-term usability over short-lived fashion trends. They rejected overt fruit/vegetable patterning but favored a soft-touch, spongy feel for tactile comfort, with large, clearly labeled controls that can be distinguished by feel in the dark (using distinct shapes/reliefs and avoiding ambiguous icons like a V-shaped volume mark).\n\nSeveral layout options were explored\u2014an old rotary-phone-inspired ring, iPod-style scroll wheel, and side scroll strips\u2014but the group ultimately converged on a push-button interface that plays to the company\u2019s strengths and keeps costs down. The final navigation concept is a four-way directional pad (up/down/left/right) with a central \u201center/select,\u201d used for channel/volume and for navigating on-screen menus. To avoid accidental input, side scroll ideas were dropped or would require deliberate depression to activate. Backlighting on press was supported (with the possibility of a yellow glow to match brand colors).\n\nTo reduce expense and complexity, the team decided against an LCD on the remote. Instead, an on-screen display (OSD) on the TV will present menus, program info, and settings, controlled by the D\u2011pad. A child-friendly variant and a locator function (audible finder) were discussed, but voice control for commands was declined due to complexity and cost.\n\nExact button set (e.g., inclusion of full number keys) was left for the User Interface Designer to finalize, working with the Industrial Designer on a clay prototype of the look-and-feel consistent with the compact, ergonomic concept.",
    "- Plastic material: The project manager pushed to switch to a plastic, solid casing to hit the tight cost target while keeping the LCD (the team\u2019s key differentiator). He noted plastic effectively incurred no cost in their model, whereas rubber and double-curved forms pushed them over budget. Although it \u201cpained\u201d him to drop the rubber, bio\u2011morphic concept, he concluded plastic was the pragmatic choice.\n\n- Changeable cover: He was cautiously supportive. Early on he warned that swappable covers might complicate logistics and supply lines, which superiors might dislike. As a compromise, he proposed a basic, cheap plastic body that could be \u201cfancied up\u201d with optional covers (even wood) as after-sales accessories. Later he aligned with selling multiple cover options, seeing it as a way to add revenue while keeping the base unit affordable.\n\n- Color: He recognized default remotes are black/grey and was open to a standout color (he even liked the suggested yellow) to make the device easier to find. With the brand\u2019s \u201cfashion/fruit & veg\u201d brief, he advocated \u201cflashy fruity colours\u201d as the standard for the younger target, with more traditional finishes offered as paid extras if desired. He also tried to keep a \u201cspecial colour\u201d in scope if small savings (e.g., per-button costs) could fund it.\n\n- Shape: To control cost, he favored moving from double\u2011curved to single\u2011curved (or even flatter) geometry, while trying to preserve articulation if feasible. He accepted that a solid plastic design might compromise the LCD\u2019s ideal placement for left/right-handed use, but felt the distinctive shape could still aid findability and meet fashion goals within budget.",
    "- What to fix and when: The team agreed to freeze the system on the development data by Tuesday (ahead of the Wednesday EU deadline). As soon as partners deliver the latest data, they will start training and begin the write-up in parallel. After the freeze, German and Danish will be processed with fixed models (no retraining; just HTK runs).\n\n- Architectures under consideration: They will focus on three \u201cbest\u201d variants (plus possibly a fourth with a single KLT):\n  1) Two-stream \u201ccombo\u201d without the low-pass branch (yellow-marked best).\n  2) A similar two-stream system but without KLT on the left path (also a \u201cmaybe\u201d), which does better on highly mismatched Italian.\n  3) The OGI-feature baseline-plus-MLP variant, evaluated with/without KLT and with added MLP \u201cSIL\u201d output in the feature vector.\n  - Variants using the \u201cfilt\u201d (second-stage silence detection) are excluded due to unacceptable latency, despite modest gains.\n  - Low-pass cepstral filtering shows small, situational benefits.\n  - Running the neural-net transform in parallel with the features consistently helps versus running it in sequence.\n\n- Evaluation and selection: Results will be combined with the agreed weighting (40% TI-digits, 60% SpeechDat-Car; they also noted a 40/35/25 scheme across match conditions) applied to percentages. They will include TI-digits once ready, report test-set sizes, and run significance tests to judge small deltas.\n\n- Baseline and improvements: The consortium\u2019s \u201cnew baseline\u201d is ~22% better than the old one. Their own endpointing/VAD yields ~21% overall and ~27% gains on SpeechDat-Car. There is an ongoing standards debate: some propose relaxing the 50% improvement criterion; OGI, Nokia, and Qualcomm push to keep 50%. Practically, that implies needing roughly \u226550% over the new baseline (i.e., \u224860% over the original).",
    "- Legislation: In Wales\u2019 Healthy Weight consultation, officials discussed possible laws to restrict price promotions on unhealthy foods and ban sales of energy drinks to children, alongside stronger use of the planning system (e.g., curbing new hot-food takeaways near schools). They noted Assembly time is tight this term; measures would follow consultation. Health Impact Assessments under the Public Health (Wales) Act were highlighted to shape healthier built environments. In Canada, the government advanced firearms regulations (with future buyback legislation promised) and tied large-employer COVID financing to conditions (e.g., transparency, limits on dividends/buybacks and tax-avoidance scrutiny).\n\n- Sports infrastructure: Witnesses urged designing new schools with community-ready facilities (changing rooms/toilets) so they double as local sport hubs. The CMO backed embedding health in all public builds via health impact assessments. Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales are aligning school activity programs.\n\n- Energy resources and tourism support: Canada announced liquidity support for oil and gas (large-employer financing and expanded credit access) and emphasized protecting sector jobs, including Indigenous workers. Tourism ministers committed to work with operators (e.g., via ACOA) as borders and travel remain restricted; ferry viability and broader destination readiness were flagged.\n\n- Green economy and small business funding: Ministers were tasked with planning a green recovery, while critics questioned EDC\u2019s $500m support to Coastal GasLink versus forestry and clean growth. For SMEs, Ottawa rolled out rent relief (CECRA up to 75% with landlord participation), wage subsidies/credit, and is facilitating PPE access as economies reopen.\n\n- COVID-19 impacts: Fisheries faced collapsed markets (e.g., lobster), prompting $62.5m for processors, CERB access for seasonal/fishers, and work on further harvester supports. Tourism season losses are severe due to border limits. Oil and gas suffered from demand collapse and price shocks, addressed through liquidity and credit backstops.",
    "- Number of functions: The team agreed to keep the remote TV\u2011only with a minimal, easy set: power, numbers, channel up/down, volume, and mute. DVD/VCR controls were dropped; an LCD was rejected as costly/complex. Rarely used settings would be grouped behind a single menu if included at all. Teletext was ultimately de\u2011emphasized per management. Tactile, larger buttons with brief backlighting were preferred; a \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d beeper/base was explored.\n\n- Shape change: They moved away from the standard rectangle toward an ergonomic, organic silhouette to feel modern and be easier to hold and use in the dark.\n\n- Single\u2011curved choice: After debating double\u2011curved for ergonomics, they chose a single\u2011curved body to maintain comfort while keeping options open for conventional controls (e.g., side volume or a central control) and simplifying manufacturing.\n\n- Personalization idea: Interchangeable, spongy rubber shells (in bright, fruit\u2011inspired colors/patterns) were proposed so users could swap looks.\n\n- Feasibility of personalization: Judged feasible within cost; a later cost pass came in under the \u20ac12.50 build target. Detailed image printing might be limited, but colored/embossed rubber shells are workable.\n\n- Opinion on a novel shape: The team liked novelty for trend appeal but cautioned against gimmicks that hurt usability. Literal 3D fruit forms (e.g., banana) were viewed as risky; \u201cfruit\u2011inspired, not fruit\u2011shaped\u201d was the safer direction.\n\n- Final casing shape decision: An ergonomic, single\u2011curved, soft-touch rubber/latex casing with a spongy feel, offered with interchangeable shells in bold, fruit\u2011inspired colors/patterns. The emphasis is on a comfortable \u201corganic\u201d form rather than a literal novelty sculpture.",
    "Marketing proposed lemon/lime colors to give the product a distinctive, cohesive \u201clook and feel\u201d that consumers prioritize, while aligning it with current style trends. Their research showed buyers rank a fancy, high\u2011tech aesthetic above added functionality; thus, innovation should be perceived through appearance and tactile experience. Trend watching highlighted an emerging European theme of fruit and vegetables, plus a broader shift toward soft, spongy, ergonomic materials and vibrant, natural colors. Lemon/lime serves as a unifying theme that naturally evokes that trend\u2014fresh, bright, organic\u2014and can guide choices in color, materials, shapes, and even lighting effects.\n\nPractically, bright lemon/lime also solves a usability gripe: most remotes are dark \u201cbricks\u201d that get lost in dim rooms. A vivid yellow/green body (potentially translucent or softly glowing) is easier to spot and aligns with the company\u2019s existing yellow corporate color, tying product identity to brand. The team also noted that many contemporary digital products and websites use these citrus tones, suggesting cultural familiarity and modernity without copying last year\u2019s glossy, hard aesthetic (e.g., classic iPod). Finally, the theme supports optional variations\u2014swappable covers, color\u2011changing backlights\u2014extending the line while keeping a coherent visual identity.\n\nIn short, lemon/lime was proposed to ride the fruit/veg and vibrant\u2011color trend, signal innovation through design, improve visibility, differentiate from dark, cluttered competitors, and create a memorable, brand\u2011consistent aesthetic platform.",
    "Conclusion: Proceed to prototype/market with minor tweaks.\n\nStyle: The team aligned on a distinctive, fashion-led flip-open remote: primary, frequently used controls are large, soft rubber buttons on the base; advanced functions appear on a small black\u2011and\u2011white touch LCD in the lid. The exterior emphasizes a spongy tactile feel and bold \u201cfruit/vegetable\u201d colors with interchangeable fascias; ergonomic curvature (banana/shell-like forms) and clear corporate branding make it stand out and feel comfortable.\n\nMarket research: Findings (100 users) supported simplification and aesthetics\u201480% would pay more for a \u201cfancy\u201d device; ~50% use only ~10% of buttons; many \u201czap\u201d frequently and often lose remotes. Younger users favored LCD/voice features; older users were ambivalent. This validated the uncluttered two-tier UI, bold styling, and the need for easy\u2011locate measures. Initial targeting will skew toward younger/mid\u2011range \u201ctrendy/business\u201d users, with aesthetic variants by market, while keeping one core electronics design.\n\nAdjustments under new requirements: With scope reduced to TV\u2011only (no teletext), programming complexity is replaced by a Videoplus-style prompt on the LCD. To meet the base price target, voice recognition is removed (kept as a potential premium/business option). A cheaper \u201cfind me\u201d alternative (TV-mounted beep trigger) and distinctive form/color help with location. Battery choices favor standard/rechargeable solutions over kinetic to control cost and risk.\n\nMinimizing RSI: This remained the weakest criterion. The design mitigates strain via large, soft buttons, improved spacing, ergonomic curvature, and reduced surface clutter, but cannot fully eliminate repetitive thumb movements given current technology. The team judged this acceptable for launch and a topic for future refinement.",
    "- Future of institutions: The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales warned that Brexit-created uncertainty threatens Welsh universities\u2019 income from EU students, research programs and structural funds. Early indicators show falling applications to Wales from EU (-8%) and non\u2011EU (-9%) students while England rose, reflecting weaker capital investment, fewer high\u2011tariff institutions, and an \u201cAnglocentric\u201d pull. Institutions are running managed deficits while awaiting Diamond review reinvestment, facing rising pay/pension costs and tighter lending. They are scenario\u2011planning, pushing \u201cStudy in Wales,\u201d and urging continued access to Erasmus and Horizon Europe; loss of EU students would reduce cohort richness though baseline quality standards should hold. Reid\u2019s recommendations to rebuild research capacity and overhead funding were highlighted.\n\n- Women\u2019s issues: Members stressed COVID-19\u2019s gendered impacts\u2014women lost a disproportionate share of jobs and assumed more care work. They pressed for affordable, universal child care; rigorous GBA+ on emergency programs; fixes for maternity/parental EI eligibility gaps; and concrete action on the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Government tabled the Women, Peace and Security progress report and cited measures for students, seniors and people with disabilities, while being challenged to extend CERB without punitive provisions.\n\n- Housing: The committee heard that the $4B Canada Housing Benefit (2017) is slow\u2014only one province signed on\u2014with calls to adopt sector principles and speed delivery. Ministers defended the $55B, 10\u2011year National Housing Strategy, framing CHB as a bridge for households in core need toward permanent housing, and noted ongoing federal\u2011provincial work. Members urged post\u2011COVID affordable-housing stimulus and support for municipalities purchasing hotels for permanent housing.\n\n- Members\u2019 discussions: Broad debates covered anti\u2011Black and anti\u2011Indigenous racism (profiling, over\u2011policing, race-based data), Huawei/5G, airports, firearms OIC, Auditor General funding, agriculture supports, border family reunification, PPE procurement, rural broadband, veterans\u2019 backlogs, and small\u2011business aid.",
    "The team is close to finishing the Meeting Recorder digits corpus; a few forms are missing when speakers skipped meetings. Plan: once complete, train a recognizer and begin experiments. Initial evaluation strategy is to train on the standard TI-digits training set and test on the meeting digits test set; near-microphone performance should be reasonable, but distant microphones are expected to perform poorly initially, with improvement targeted over the next 1\u20132 years.\n\nAnnotation workflow: digits aren\u2019t simple transcripts due to false starts and misreads. Grad F built X Waves scripts to quickly locate and mark each prompted digit string and to log segments in a fixed format. Decision: have the transcribers do the digit extraction (fits their skills and enriches the main transcripts); they may also enter header metadata (name, date, times), though that may be deprioritized to preserve transcription throughput. Grad F will prepare files and hand off to Jane and the transcribers.\n\nBenchmarking and expectations: TI-digits best published results are ~0.25% (many systems 0.5\u20130.75%; prior in-house <1%) in clean, close-talk conditions. Aurora car-noise digits show ~5% per-digit error under realistic noise. For Meeting Recorder digits, the SRI system with online unsupervised adaptation gives ~3\u20134% on English, near-mic; without adaptation error is ~50% higher. The group attributes the gap vs TI-digits mainly to training data scale and recording conditions/prosody (read groupings vs natural grouping, cross-word effects). Next steps include trying tandem features into the SRI backend and scaling training.\n\nData/format issues: allow natural \u201czero\u201d vs \u201coh\u201d pronunciations; forms group digits to elicit realistic reading. Within 1\u20132 weeks, channelized, post-edited transcripts should enable forced alignment and broader experiments.",
    "- Marketing: Recommends adding speech recognition to differentiate the product and justify a higher price. Cites survey data showing 75\u201390% of 15\u201335-year-olds would pay extra for voice on a remote. Sees first-to-market potential, \u201ctrendy/fancy\u201d brand lift, and simple one-word commands (on/off, louder/softer, channel) as compelling. Also proposes a voice-triggered locator (say \u201cremote,\u201d it beeps) to solve the \u201clost remote\u201d pain point.\n\n- User Interface (UI): Acknowledges potential user benefit\u2014fewer button presses and hands-free control for core actions\u2014but only if the recognizer robustly filters ambient TV speech and prevents accidental triggers. Suggests limiting to a small, exact vocabulary and/or a wake word to mitigate false activations. Frames it as a good marketing hook if (and only if) technical quality avoids user frustration; otherwise warns it could be impractical.\n\n- Industrial designer: Conditionally supportive if user training is used to personalize commands and reduce hardware cost/complexity. Notes power implications (always-listening may need wireless/solar charging ideas) and stresses durability/reliability; wary of interference from TV audio. Benefit framed mainly as feasibility at controlled cost rather than as a primary UX win.\n\n- User interface designer (later discussion): Points to existing voice remotes that store up to ~80 speech samples and control multiple devices (TV, cable, DVD, audio) as evidence of viability. Proposes isolating voice setup/programming in a \u201ccontrol\u201d module while keeping the hand unit simple, reducing button clutter and complexity. Potential benefits: simpler daily use (one-word commands), multi-device control without memorizing sequences, and fewer physical buttons.\n\nOverall: Marketing strongly advocates voice for differentiation and willingness-to-pay; UI and the industrial designer are cautious, recommending it only if false triggers are solved and costs are contained; the UI designer highlights multi-device simplicity and reduced complexity as user benefits.",
    "Consortia: Witnesses agreed regional working is necessary but uneven. Estyn\u2019s Jassa Scott said consortia have improved their knowledge of schools since 2017 and are using it better to support and challenge, especially on literacy/numeracy; support for digital competence is weaker, and impact in secondary schools is lower due to specialist recruitment gaps and less strong practice to share. Consortia aren\u2019t statutory, so Estyn inspects their work via local-authority inspections and will run thematic reviews on curriculum reform. She and HMCI highlighted serious governance instability in ERW (south\u2011west/mid\u2011Wales)\u2014leadership churn, unagreed budgets, cancelled meetings\u2014creating risk and distraction; Estyn will visit, and survey schools.

It will be a universal controller with device-selection (TV/DVD/VCR/stereo) powered by a simple \u201csmart\u201d chip and IR emitter. Advanced features (audio/video settings, language/subtitles) will be accessed via a single Menu button rather than many dedicated keys. Buttons will be raised, clearly symbol-labeled (international), and largely operable with one thumb; the on/off key will be large and prominent. An LED provides feedback/battery indication.\n\n- Lost-and-found realization: The team converged on adding a \u201choming\u201d capability. Two concrete implementations were explored: (1) an onboard light sensor that triggers a beep or blink when the remote is obscured/hidden (e.g., under a newspaper), and (2) a pager-style find button on a charger/base (or on the TV) that makes the remote beep, similar to cordless phones. Clap/voice triggers were discussed but deemed unreliable/nonspecific. Cost/complexity were noted; final selection would balance reliability with budget.\n\n- Improvements from project evaluation: Layout simplification (fewer, larger buttons; removal of rarely used transport keys), ergonomic biomorphic shape, soft rubber keycaps, one-hand reach, and consistent symbols. Consider consolidating duplicate functions (e.g., one mute) to free space for voice-controls. Keep bill of materials near the ~\u20ac8.20 level, preserving headroom for signature features and company colors/branding. A protective \u201coyster\u201d holder was proposed.\n\n- New functions brainstormed: Voice recognition as the marquee feature (e.g., \u201cChannel five\u201d), potential accessibility benefits, \u201cswap/last channel,\u201d subtitle/language control, and broader multi-device control (including ideas like HVAC/heating). The team deprioritized teletext-like features and emphasized trendy, user-friendly design.",
    "During the finance/costing discussion, the team focused on how \u201cspecial colors\u201d affected unit cost. Initially, they expected multiple colors: the case would have a single body color (often the corporate yellow/black option), and the buttons could use up to three special colors. There was confusion about whether those color counts applied per unit or across variants, and whether the R_R_ logo would add another special color. To hit the \u20ac12.5 target, they shifted to cost\u2011reduction: consolidate and \u201chave our buttons all be one colour,\u201d keep buttons in rubber, and limit special colors on the case/logo because each additional special color raised costs in the spreadsheet.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied because the cost\u2011driven simplification undermined their brief. They had argued for at least three colors to support a fashionable, \u201cfruity\u201d look and strong brand recognition (corporate yellow/black plus accents). Moving to single\u2011color buttons reduced visual appeal and distinctiveness they believed would help the product stand out and align with the fashion criteria. Marketing also pushed back on other button changes tied to cost, such as consolidating controls (e.g., treating volume/channel rockers as \u201cone button\u201d) and proposals to replace numeric keys with a scroll solution\u2014changes they felt would alienate older users who expect clear, familiar, and easily distinguishable controls. In short, the finance compromises (fewer special colors and simplified buttons) clashed with Marketing\u2019s goals for style, brand expression, and user expectations.",
    "- Welsh dimension (curriculum): Members pressed for concrete support to implement a strong Welsh dimension. The Minister confirmed a dedicated workstream is mapping and developing resources and is coordinating with Qualifications Wales to avoid past gaps between new content and supporting materials. She agreed with calls (e.g., Learned Society of Wales) for accessible resources and stressed the Welsh dimension must be embedded across all Areas of Learning and Experience, not confined to history. Example given: showcasing Wales\u2019s contribution to computing within coding lessons. For Welsh language, a single continuum of progression will apply, but expectations will be contextualised by medium (Welsh- or English-medium settings), recognising differing progression rates while maintaining clear national progression steps.\n\n- Employers\u2019 understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac): FE leaders and an employer representative agreed most employers do not understand the Welsh Bac; the title itself is unhelpful, with the Skills Challenge Certificate better understood. Employers focus on core/vocational qualifications and basic skills, and see the Bac as bureaucratic unless its workplace value is made clear. Witnesses recommended: (1) a review co-designed with employers to sharpen employability and entrepreneurial skills, (2) structured, not ad\u2011hoc, employer engagement (e.g., leveraging social value clauses) to co-deliver real projects, and (3) clearer communication to parents and learners. The Bac is used less at Levels 1\u20132 (pressure of GCSE resits) and more at Level 3, where university recognition is mixed\u2014many Russell Group courses prefer three A\u2011levels (sometimes plus the Bac) or four A\u2011levels.\n\n- Independent inspection in Wales: Estyn highlighted benefits of a Welsh, independent inspectorate tailored to national reforms, notably its extensive use of peer inspectors and the \u201cnominee\u201d model that brings providers into the process, improving credibility, sector learning, and post\u2011inspection improvement. Independence enables alignment with Wales\u2019s curriculum agenda while still learning from other nations.",
    "The group found the presentation and meeting materials only moderately convenient, favoring simple, analog tools over heavier tech.\n\n- Slideware and documents: PowerPoint was broadly disliked. The UI lead called it \u201cstupid,\u201d and the industrial designer said they\u2019re not a fan of Microsoft tools in general. Marketing felt their own materials were helpful, suggesting usefulness depended on role. The project manager couldn\u2019t access the linked websites others used, which left them out of sync\u2014an inconvenience attributed to uneven access to resources.\n\n- Whiteboard and pens: Generally positive. Despite a prior marker failure, the physical pens were praised because writing \u201cshows up here,\u201d without needing to watch a screen while writing. Participants preferred the immediacy and visibility of the whiteboard to digital annotation.\n\n- Microphones and recording tech: Mixed to negative. Mics were \u201cokay\u201d when seated but clumsy at the whiteboard. Several questioned the value of meeting capture; they wouldn\u2019t watch a long video to catch up, believing a missed meeting could be summarized in a sentence. Overall, the recording infrastructure added friction without clear benefit.\n\n- Net view on convenience: The team found low-friction, tangible tools (whiteboard, good markers) most convenient and conducive to discussion and idea generation. Digital slide decks, constrained information feeds, and capture tech were seen as less convenient and of limited practical use, with perceived value varying by role. They preferred concise notes and live discussion over formal presentations and recordings.",
    "They rejected LCDs because the trade\u2011offs outweighed the benefits for their concept. Functionally, an LCD would be small, hard to read from across a room, and would force users to look down at the remote while watching TV. It would also need backlighting because remotes are used in the dark, increasing power draw. Critically, the team noted the remote can\u2019t receive program data from the TV (no two\u2011way link), so an LCD couldn\u2019t show listings or \u201cwhat\u2019s on,\u201d limiting its usefulness versus a TV on\u2011screen display (OSD). They preferred to surface essential actions on large, tactile buttons and put advanced settings into an OSD controlled by those buttons.\n\nFrom a cost and complexity standpoint, an LCD requires an advanced logic chip and more components, raising manufacturing cost and time to market. The group wanted to keep a simple or regular chip, minimize components, and invest limited budget in things that matter more to the concept\u2014fashionable materials/finishes (curved, rubber/spongy feel, bright colors) and possibly a kinetic-plus-battery power approach. Power life was a concern; avoiding an LCD helps preserve battery life.\n\nFinally, against their marketing brief, \u201cinnovation\u201d should enhance look and feel rather than add tech for tech\u2019s sake. They felt they could deliver a high\u2011tech impression more simply with backlit/transparent cases or illuminated buttons, without the cost, complexity, and UX downsides of an LCD. Therefore, they chose pushbuttons (and potentially a jog/scroll for select functions) with a TV on\u2011screen menu instead of an LCD on the remote.",
    "Self\u2011introductions and roles: The team opened by introducing themselves and their roles\u2014Project Manager (Heather), Marketing (Andrew), User Interface (Craig), and Industrial Designer (David). A quick team\u2011building exercise (drawing/favorite animals) broke the ice and familiarized everyone with the whiteboard tools.\n\nProject introduction: The brief was to design a trendy, ergonomic television remote control to sell at \u20ac25 with a maximum production cost of \u20ac12.50, aiming for broad European appeal. The team discussed whether to remain TV\u2011only or move toward universal control and noted international and demographic considerations.\n\nBrainstorming: Pain points identified: too many/confusing buttons, poor low\u2011light use, and losing the remote. Concepts explored included a \u201cbanana\u201d form factor with a weighted base/locator (call button), antenna-like \u201cleaves,\u201d scroll wheels for volume/channel, a turbo button for fast channel surfing, teletext navigation via scrolls, backlit buttons, and a docking/charging station (solar considered but dropped). An alternative concept used a small LCD plus a jog dial for advanced settings (brightness/contrast/sound modes), later reconsidered for cost.\n\nProject evaluation: Using 1\u20137 scales (fancy, functional, cost fit, purchase intent), the design scored well on novelty/ergonomics but mixed on functionality (digit buttons missing for some users) and purchase intent (younger \u201ctrendsetters\u201d more positive). Street/focus\u2011group testing was recommended.\n\nProcess and cost work: The team iterated through conceptual, functional, and detailed design, used Play\u2011Doh for quick prototyping, and costed components in Excel. To reach \u20ac12.50 they removed the LCD/advanced chip, favored a single\u2011curved plastic case over rubber, limited colors, and consolidated buttons (scroll\u2011centric control). Process reflections: tools were useful but clunky; timeboxes helped; more ongoing collaboration and earlier physical prototypes were suggested. Next steps: build a working prototype, run user testing with target segments, and refine features/costs (and possibly offer color/style variants).",
    "The team saw rechargeable capability as a nice-to-have \u201cgadget\u201d that could help make the simple remote feel special, especially if paired with a base/dock that also lets users locate the remote via a beep or flashing light. The project manager liked the idea because it removes the annoyance of dead batteries and could be a differentiator at a \u20ac25 retail price, noting low manufacturing costs might make it feasible. They floated multiple implementations: a mains\u2011powered base that charges the remote; using rechargeable AA (Penlite) cells that can also be swapped for regular batteries if the user forgets to charge; or even charging via a wire without a dock.\n\nHowever, significant reservations were raised. The industrial designer argued current remotes already last 2\u20133 years on standard batteries, so the benefit may not justify added cost, complexity, space, and the need for a powered base. Marketing suggested the locator base could exist without charging to control costs. The user interface lead questioned whether customers would pay extra specifically for rechargeability; marketing believed some would pay for comfort, but this needed validation.\n\nNet result: no firm commitment. They agreed to research feasibility, costs, and willingness to pay within the tight cost target (~\u20ac12.5 production, \u20ac25 retail). The locator/beep feature remained a priority, with charging treated as optional. Importantly, if included, the remote should still accept standard batteries for immediate use. The project manager explicitly stated that recharge functionality would be the first feature cut if budgets were tight.",
    "The group agreed to standardize on close-talking, head\u2011mounted microphones and phase out the lapel mic, which was judged inferior and a source of cross-speaker variability that hurts transcription, recognition, and prosody work. Uniformity across speakers was prioritized over variety: the plan is to evaluate a more comfortable head-mounted headset (e.g., Crown CM\u2011311AE) compatible with the existing Sony wireless packs (via Sony\u2019s proprietary connector and, if needed, custom-wired pigtails). They will buy one unit first for comfort and audio quality testing; if it proves better, they will purchase a full set (target ~9) so all primary participants use the same model.\n\nProcedurally, they set placement guidance: position the boom toward the corner of the mouth, roughly a thumb to a thumb-and-a-half away, to reduce breath noise and improve SNR. Comfort is a requirement; a \u201cfield trip\u201d to try alternatives was proposed.\n\nOn logistics, wireless vs. wired was deemed secondary; if wireless channels are limited, additional identical headsets can be recorded via wired inputs and time-aligned at meeting start. They will explore adding one more wireless channel (new transmitter/receiver) and consider a handheld pass-around mic for overflow speakers when attendance exceeds the fixed channels. Known hardware issues (some \u201cJimlet\u201d jacks failing) must be addressed. The goal is a full complement of identical mics within the 16-channel limit, with any extra channels handled carefully.\n\nIn short: adopt uniform, comfortable head-mounted mics; document and enforce proper wearing procedure; test then bulk-purchase; expand/repair infrastructure as needed; and use a handheld overflow mic when necessary.",
    "Meilyr Rowlands\n- Challenges in secondary schools: Secondary schools face greater challenges than primaries in preparing for the new curriculum. He highlighted deficits and the time/headspace lost to managing budgets, recruitment shortfalls (especially subject specialists), leadership and teaching quality issues, and the stronger pull of qualifications that can crowd out broader improvement. A higher proportion of secondary schools need significant support; recovery from special measures averages just over two years. He backed a multi\u2011agency model to identify \u201cat\u2011risk\u201d schools earlier and target support.\n- Ensuring safety and well\u2011being: Pupils\u2019 confidence that schools help with emotional and mental well\u2011being drops markedly by key stage 4. Contributing factors include fewer \u201cgo\u2011to\u201d adults, weaker/variable PSE, and tighter budgets reducing pastoral roles. He urged ACE\u2011aware staff, robust pupil\u2011tracking, and coherent multi\u2011agency support. On independent schools, Estyn and CIW share oversight; he noted the need for better awareness of safeguarding guidance and fuller intelligence sharing.\n- Studying from home/digital: While not focused on home study, he warned consortia support for digital competence has lagged and stressed sustaining higher\u2011order reading (whole books) and applied numeracy.\n\nKirsty Williams AM\n- Ensuring safety: No imminent wider reopening; any next phase depends on CMO/CSO advice. Decisions will prioritise health and well\u2011being and address operations (social distancing, transport, school\u2011gate crowding, staffing). Hubs follow safety guidance; symptomatic staff/families can and should be tested. Test\u2011trace\u2011isolate will be critical.\n- Support for emotional/mental health: Extra funding to local authorities to expand counselling/therapeutic support now (via phone/video and family\u2011based approaches) and to upskill counsellors. Schools and youth workers must maintain contact and make safeguarding referrals. ALN learners receive risk\u2011assessed support, including access to specialist hubs where appropriate.\n- Studying from home: \u201cStay Safe. Stay Learning\u201d on Hwb provides guidance for parents and learners. To tackle digital exclusion, government is loaning devices, converting older kit to Chromebooks, and supplying Mi\u2011Fi connectivity, working with LAs to target non\u2011engaging pupils. Hwb hosts extensive resources, including HE/FE transition content and BBC Bitesize. Performance measures and attendance pressures are suspended.",
    "He treated the spherical concept with caution, stressing that form must follow function. A pure ball would roll away, so he said it needs a stability solution\u2014at least a flat spot\u2014acknowledging a compromise between stability and design. He questioned a flip/lid or hinged \u201copening\u201d concept: users would likely leave it open, the hinge becomes a weak point, and breakage risk rises. He pushed durability early\u2014materials and construction should survive being tossed, yet he wryly noted more breakage means more sales, underscoring the trade-off the team must choose.\n\nErgonomically, he referenced game-pad forms that fill the hand as a model for comfortable, secure grip, and warned that one\u2011handed, very small designs look sleek but can be less usable. For the ball idea specifically, he emphasized intuitive orientation: remotes still need to be \u201caimed,\u201d especially as batteries weaken, so the device must signal front/back without thinking\u2014through shape, layout, or other cues. He even entertained the notion that, despite the novelty of a sphere, the classic elongated rectangle remains the most straightforward way to satisfy use and orientation requirements.\n\nFunctionally, he advocated for simplicity and accessible, easy\u2011to\u2011press controls, and cautioned against clutter. He did not push advanced mechanisms for the sphere (like complex sensors or constant opening actions), preferring solutions that keep the device robust, instinctive to use, and manufacturable. Overall, he favored a trendy look only insofar as it didn\u2019t undermine stability, durability, and intuitive operation.",
    "- Erasmus and student mobility funding: The witnesses and Members agreed Erasmus+ is a well\u2011established, efficient, internationally recognised scheme that underpins large volumes of outward mobility and provides shared infrastructure Wales could not replicate cheaply. While Cardiff University indicated only around 40% of its mobility funding comes from Erasmus+, the sector is already using institutional and fee-and-access plan income to support mobility (seven universities referenced targets or actions). Their clear preference is continued UK/Welsh association to Erasmus after Brexit. If access were lost, a Wales\u2011only replacement would be more costly and less efficient; the better approach would be to retain Erasmus participation and, if needed, layer a \u201cmade\u2011in\u2011Wales\u201d supplement on top. The sector is committed to promoting and resourcing mobility regardless, and HEFCW is open to using mobility in performance measures, but stresses the value of the Erasmus brand and infrastructure.\n\n- Tuition fee refunds: On whether students should be refunded part of their fees if the academic year cannot be completed as normal, the Government and sector did not support blanket refunds. Institutions are moving teaching and assessment online and will use established quality assurance and enhancement processes to ensure learning outcomes are met. Students have recourse to course-level feedback/appeals via their institutions and, if unresolved, to the UK Office of the Independent Adjudicator. The stance is to maintain delivery and protect academic standards rather than pre\u2011emptively refund fees, using these mechanisms to address any gaps or concerns in individual cases.",
    "Across the meetings, members reviewed how authorities are organizing and governing services locally. In Wales, local authorities reported new behaviour and well\u2011being strategies, stronger PRU networks, devolved reintegration funding to schools, and work on commissioning and quality assurance for EOTAS providers. Wider post\u201116 reform is moving toward a new national PCET commission, while regional skills partnerships are being tightened following an external governance review. In Canada, federal\u2011provincial roles were underscored, with premiers seeking unconditional health transfers and ministers stressing joint responsibility; committees were repeatedly noted as \u201cmasters of their own destiny.\u201d\n\nCondolences were entered for community leaders and builders, including Mayor Stephan Lavoie (Preissac), journalist\u2011publisher Tristan Roy (Mont\u2011Royal), and entrepreneur Richard Losier (St\u2011Isidore), alongside tributes to frontline workers and graduates.\n\nEmployment dominated: governments highlighted CEWS, CEBA and CERB, with extensions signalled; MPs pressed gaps affecting rent relief, businesses without the right bank setup, seasonal and forestry workers, airports, and tourism. Youth jobs and rural broadband were flagged as urgent enablers for recovery.\n\nWorker safety focused on PPE supply and transparency (including sole\u2011source arrangements and the role of Indigenous suppliers), long\u2011term care failures that drew in CAF support, protections for temporary foreign agricultural workers after a COVID\u201119 death, and safe reopening standards. Calls continued for race\u2011based data and justice reforms to improve safety for Black and Indigenous people.\n\nPay disputes centered on Welsh FE colleges, where unions seek parity with schoolteachers. Ministers acknowledged the pressure created by recent teacher settlements, said colleges as employers must negotiate, and noted parallel concerns about non\u2011teaching staff and impending pension cost increases, which may require further government consideration depending on UK funding flows.",
    "Two distinct acknowledgements were made.\n\nFirst, speaking from Whitehorse, the Yukon MP highlighted a historic northern milestone\u2014Yukon\u2019s transition to Yukon University, Canada\u2019s first university north of 60. In doing so, he effectively thanked the House of Commons for enabling participation from Whitehorse during the pandemic hybrid sittings, which allowed him to mark the occasion on the record and to recognize those who made it possible\u2014particularly the staff of Yukon College and outgoing president Karen Barnes\u2014while speaking on the traditional territory of the Kwanlin D\u00fcn First Nation and the Ta\u2019an Kw\u00e4ch\u2019\u00e4n Council.\n\nSecond, members of the Canadian Armed Forces were thanked for their critical work in long-term care homes. MPs noted two reasons: their hands\u2011on assistance caring for residents during COVID\u201119, and their detailed observations\u2014compiled under Brigadier\u2011General Conrad Mialkowski\u2014documenting deplorable conditions in several Ontario facilities. That reporting was described as \u201chistoric\u201d because it exposed systemic neglect and abuse, galvanizing calls for immediate action, rigorous oversight, and reforms to protect seniors. In short, CAF members were recognized both for frontline service and for shining a light on unacceptable care, prompting governments to act.",
    "The team converged on a TV-only remote that emphasizes simplicity, ergonomics, and a fashionable brand identity. Core functional scope was trimmed to the most-used actions\u2014power, channel change, and volume\u2014plus a single Options/Settings entry point that leads to submenus, consolidating low\u2011frequency functions. Teletext and multi-device control (DVD/VCR) were dropped by management. Infrared remains the transmission standard; a \u201cfind my remote\u201d feature is prioritized via a small radio beacon and audible buzzer, because losing the remote was a top user complaint.\n\nDesign requirements are driven by a \u20ac25 retail price and ~\u20ac12.50 cost target. The casing should be durable, comfortable, and trend-forward: hard plastic with a rubberized feel or hard rubber, rounded/curved form that can stand on a table, and interchangeable or at least varied colorways (youthful \u201cfruity\u201d and muted \u201cautumn\u201d palettes). Buttons or on-screen elements should be large, tactile, and/or briefly backlit for dark rooms; glow-in-the-dark markings were discussed but backlighting was preferred for aesthetics and battery life. Corporate branding and the slogan \u201cwe put fashion in electronics\u201d must be visibly incorporated. Voice recognition was attractive to younger users but deprioritized due to cost, complexity, and reliability in noisy environments.\n\nPrioritized functional requirement: simple, reliable TV control of power, channel, and volume, plus findability.\n\nScroll feature: Two ideas were debated. A side-mounted scroll was considered less handy; instead, an iPod-like touch wheel on the face was explored for rapid channel browsing and possibly volume, toggled by a center select. The group agreed scrolling aids long lists (e.g., setup/channel search), but with few top-level options, direct on-screen buttons and a Back control are faster. Finalization of the touch-wheel vs. pure touch-screen navigation was left open, with cost and usability testing to decide.",
    "- Upcoming meeting focus and plan: The Project Manager will open by confirming everyone received the minutes and then present newly e\u2011mailed project requirements. The team will make decisions on the core remote-control functions, explicitly aligning them with the User Requirements Specification: (1) user needs/desires; (2) functional design (what effects the device should deliver); and (3) working design (how it achieves those effects). Priorities to discuss include keeping the interface simple and fashionable, emphasizing high-frequency tasks (channel/volume) over infrequent settings, ensuring strong IR performance, and considering an LCD only if it doesn\u2019t add complexity. Branding must reflect the company image (yellow/black, \u201cwe put fashion in electronics\u201d). Options on the table: a slide/fold-out panel for advanced functions, a \u201cfind my remote\u201d feature, long-life power or a charging cradle, and whether voice recognition fits the budget and target market.\n\n- Marketing\u2019s view on repetitive strain injury (RSI): Marketing reported that users are frustrated by difficult-to-learn remotes and raised RSI concerns (repetitive strain/carpal tunnel). Their guidance is to design for ergonomics and reduce repetitive, awkward actions: fewer, larger, well-placed buttons for the most-used functions; \u201cless is more\u201d to limit strain; and a form that \u201cfeels like the way they\u2019ll use it\u201d to avoid hand injuries.\n\n- Group reflection on prior meetings and progress: The team felt productive given time limits, with technology aids helpful (prebuilt slides), but noted information flow dropped later, some role confusion, and that budget constraints curtailed creativity (e.g., cutting solar panels). They converged on simplicity-plus-fashion, a main interface with a concealed advanced panel, and debated voice recognition (ultimately viewing it as a key differentiator if cost permits). Overall, learning curves (e.g., slide-out) seemed acceptable, and future higher-budget variants remain a possibility.",
    "- Lab test findings on buttons: In usability tests with 100 users, participants said current remotes have too many small, unnecessary buttons and don\u2019t match real use. Users reported they only use about 10% of buttons. The most-used controls are channel and volume, with power used infrequently. Frequency data highlighted channel selection as by far the dominant action (e.g., \u201cchannel selection ~168 times per hour,\u201d volume also high; power ~1/hour; teletext low). Users want a simpler, \u201csnazzy but simple\u201d design focused on these core controls, with numbers 0\u20139 retained, minimal settings (ideally via a single Menu/Settings entry), and larger, easier-to-hit buttons (especially a large power button).\n\n- Finder/call button discussions: The group agreed a \u201cfind my remote\u201d feature is important. They rejected clap/whistle gimmicks and favored a dedicated \u201ccall\u201d button on a small transmitter stuck to the TV (or integrated by the TV maker). Pressing it should make the remote audibly beep; a light could be added but sound is primary because a hidden remote might not be visible. Radio was preferred over IR for the locator because IR needs line-of-sight. A charging base with a finder button was discussed but seen as adding cost; the standalone sender is preferred.\n\n- Button design and location function details: The team favored a minimal layout: larger power, channel and volume as primary, numbers retained, and either a small joystick or iPod-like touch ring plus two function buttons (Menu and OK). One-handed, thumb-first ergonomics were emphasized. For the locator, the remote would contain a radio receiver and buzzer; the TV-side sender provides power and triggers the alert.\n\n- Lighting adaptive options: The team agreed to drop lighting-adaptive features as unnecessary/complex and not market-driven, deferring such ideas to future products.",
    "- DAT and external corpora: The team noted the Santa Barbara/LDC conversational corpus was likely recorded with DAT recorders and far\u2011field mics. They plan to obtain it (essentially free) to examine its simple discourse-oriented transcription format and to explore domain/adaptation value for meeting ASR. They acknowledged using it would only make sense if someone can work on acoustic/language model adaptation from that data to meetings; questions remain about channels (two vs multiple DATs).\n\n- Power cables and room wiring: They are building table boxes that distribute headset/PZM mics and supply low\u2011voltage power, with front\u2011panel LEDs indicating a \u201clive\u201d box. Cabling will be bundled in sleeve and routed as a \u201cspeed bump\u201d across the table; 16 total channels are available, with flexible mapping via simple plug-in connectors. Risks discussed: someone unplugging a powered leg with no upstream notification. They\u2019re also considering a cleaner cabinet for the mixer and wireless laptop control (WaveLAN/Airport) to monitor levels, keeping the room tidy; the same design could be replicated at UW without wireless to save cost.\n\n- Capturing subject intention: To elicit natural language without prompt-echoing, subjects will select their own high\u2011level tasks (shopping, sightseeing, film processing) and annotate a tourist map (no textual prompts carried into the session). Pictures were considered but rejected as labor\u2011intensive/distracting; a light text+icon hybrid remains possible. They aim for unambiguous mode labeling (Enter/View/Approach), while allowing multiple concurrent intentions (e.g., go to a bakery + buy food). Representation will use XML with linked schemas: Source\u2011Path\u2011Goal, force/caused action, and commercial events, with cross\u2011references/IDs and potential XPath/XForms constraints.\n\n- Analysis approaches: For audio/transcripts, they\u2019ll: (1) minimally edit orthographic transcripts; (2) \u201cchannelize\u201d to per\u2011speaker tiers and add extra tiers for room/no-ownership noises (e.g., breaths, door slams); (3) use presegmentation (speech/non\u2011speech) and SRI forced alignment, then manual boundary corrections on diverse short excerpts; (4) seed automatic labels using rich pronunciation variants. For recognition baselines, train on TI\u2011digits and compare close\u2011talk vs distant mics, expecting initial degradation on distant channels.",
    "General specification: The team prioritized a simple, ergonomic remote focused on the most-used functions (channel up/down and volume), with large, easy-to-press buttons and minimal clutter. Infrared was chosen as the transmission method. A docking station was favored to recharge standard batteries and to host a \u201cfind-remote\u201d beeper button; kinetic charging was rejected as impractical, especially for older users. Teletext was dropped entirely. Voice recognition was also set aside due to weak demand among older users and cost/complexity at the target price.\n\nCase design and form: Manufacturing could deliver flat, single-curved, or double-curved shells. The group leaned toward a single-curved body for better ergonomics and to give the display (when used) a readable angle. The remote will lie flat (not stand), with the power button kept in the conventional top position and the display\u2014when included\u2014on top. RSI concerns informed placing core controls where the thumb naturally rests; left/right mirroring and flip-over concepts were discussed but rejected for simplicity.\n\nDecision on changeable cases: The team agreed to produce one standard core remote with interchangeable covers, adopting a \u201cNokia-style\u201d shell system. This enables a wood-look option and a plastic/grey-black option (and future styles) without redesigning the internal hardware. It also creates a small accessories market (sell additional covers).\n\nDesign changes over time: The small LCD and a jog-dial were initially proposed to surface advanced functions; to meet the tight cost cap (~\u20ac12.5 build), the LCD and advanced chip were ultimately removed, relying on on-screen TV feedback instead. Rubberized parts and backlighting were also trimmed for cost. Final direction: a fashion-forward, single-curved, simple remote, rechargeable via docking station, with interchangeable cases and clear emphasis on usability.",
    "Huw David said any unintended consequences should be minimal if the Bill is implemented carefully and properly resourced. He stressed that implementation and cultural change are crucial, noting children\u2019s social services are already overstretched and must remain focused on serious harm and neglect while expanding early intervention and family support. He emphasized the system should not criminalise parents for low-level incidents; instead, there must be a proportionate response by police and social workers, alongside accessible parenting support so families are helped rather than penalised.\n\nOn whether legislation is needed given changing norms, he argued yes. The state\u2019s paramount duty is to protect children from harm, and physical punishment constitutes harm. Far from unnecessary interference, the Bill reflects a decades-long cultural shift in Wales in which most parents neither use nor support smacking. He added that a clear legal line helps vulnerable children who may be told by adults that smacking is acceptable; the law should remove ambiguity so children and professionals alike know where the line is, enabling children to seek help.\n\nRegarding whether certain provisions should be explicitly stated in the Bill, particularly on awareness-raising, he initially noted Welsh Government\u2019s commitment to run a campaign and was unsure a statutory duty was necessary. However, when pressed on clarity and funding, he endorsed putting a duty on Welsh Ministers on the face of the Bill to lead public awareness. He indicated this would help ensure the necessary resourcing and make the implementation more effective and publicly understood.",
    "- Design and functionality: The \u201ctwo-sided\u201d concept was proposed as a way to serve two use modes: one side with a full set of advanced controls (e.g., DVD/VCR functions) and the other with a very simple TV interface (channel \u00b1, volume \u00b1, mute) for \u201cgrandma\u201d use. The user-interface lead objected that a two-sided form would be awkward to manipulate and prone to accidental presses. Mitigations discussed included a sliding back/lockout, a flip cover, or a physical lock function so only one side would be active at a time. Despite these, the team leaned away from a two-sided device in favor of a single, simple, ergonomic TV-only remote with few large buttons.\n\n- Evaluation: Their evaluation framework prioritized ease-of-use, minimal buttons, attractiveness, and sellability. Against these criteria, a two-sided remote was seen as likely to be bulkier, more confusing, and costlier. The concept that advanced to scoring (a single-sided, minimal-button design) achieved a strong average score (~1.88 on a 1=true/good to 7=false/bad scale). The two-sided idea was not taken forward to formal scoring.\n\n- Market range: Early talk included multi-device control and multiple user segments (children, elderly), but management constrained scope to TV-only and required corporate colors/branding. They favored one core model (with possible cosmetic covers) to hit an impulse-purchase retail price of about \u20ac25 and a build cost under \u20ac12.50.\n\n- Technical requirements: They wanted durability and findability across concepts. For shock-proofing, they discussed either hard molded plastic (reinforced) or a rubberized casing and rubber buttons. For water-proofing, options included a fully water-resistant build or bundling an optional waterproof sleeve/box. Additional features considered: backlit/fluorescent buttons, a \u201cfind-me\u201d beep/light, and a lock to prevent accidental input.",
    "Group 3 dealt with the Bill\u2019s regulation\u2011making powers linked to commencement. The Deputy Minister (Julie Morgan) explained that, because the Government was removing the Ministerial power to commence section 1 by Order and instead fixing a commencement date elsewhere, a technical replacement power was needed to make \u201ctransitory, transitional or saving\u201d provisions when section 1 takes effect. Her amendment 3 re\u2011inserts that limited power on the face of the Bill, with amendment 6 bringing it into force the day after Royal Assent. She stressed this added no new policy powers, simply replicated what would have sat in a commencement order. Citing the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee (CLAC), she said no Assembly procedure was recommended for this kind of power and the absence of formal procedure would not prevent scrutiny of ministerial decisions.\n\nSuzy Davies challenged the characterisation of the changes as merely technical. Through probing amendment 3A, she argued that, given new duties around awareness\u2011raising and reporting, Ministers may need broader regulation\u2011making powers than the narrow transitory/transitional/saving power, and that any such instruments should be subject to Assembly procedure (negative or affirmative) to ensure scrutiny. She noted the power now sits within the substantive section 1 rather than a separate commencement provision and questioned whether the Government would, in practice, need wider implementing regulations to deliver policy (for example, aspects of the awareness campaign or reporting framework). Amendment 3A was tabled as a \u201cholding\u201d measure to prompt discussion before Stage 3.\n\nThe Deputy Minister replied that wider powers were not considered necessary but agreed to keep the matter under review and to discuss it with Members ahead of Stage 3, acknowledging unforeseen links with other legislation might emerge. Suzy Davies moved 3A, which did not carry; the Government\u2019s amendment 3 proceeded.",
    "Brexit\u2019s main effect on Welsh fee and access plans is through reduced EU (and wider international) recruitment and the income tied to it. UCAS data showed EU\u2011domiciled applications to Wales down 8% (vs +2% in England) and non\u2011EU applicants down 9% (vs +7% in England). If that trend persists, planned fee\u2011plan investments fall unless universities replace numbers from other markets. HEFCW reviews institutions\u2019 financial forecasts alongside fee and access plans, requires explanations for variances, and allows formal plan changes where assumptions prove fundamentally wrong. Five universities explicitly referenced Brexit in 2019\u201120 plans, including measures to sustain student mobility should Erasmus participation lapse.\n\nOn Brexit readiness and protecting students, HEFCW:\n- Participates in the Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, mapping EU income exposure and advising on actions (e.g., access to Horizon Europe).\n- Challenges institutions\u2019 scenario planning and governance through twice\u2011yearly risk reviews.\n- Supports sector marketing (\u201cStudy in Wales/Global Wales\u201d) to diversify recruitment.\n- Requires student charters and protection plans (including for HE in FE) so students can complete courses if provision changes; works with NUS Wales; and maintains UK quality standards.\n\nOn domestic PPE production, MPs pressed the government to prioritize Canadian\u2011made surgical masks, gowns and N95s, citing firms that retooled (e.g., Novo Textiles) and concerns about cancelled non\u2011compliant N95 contracts. The procurement minister cited safety standards, 24 domestic contracts, receipt of 101.3 million surgical masks for distribution, an N95 contract with Medicom (Montr\u00e9al), and a GM contract for surgical masks; she affirmed support for growing domestic capacity.\n\nOn provincial projects awaiting federal approval, the infrastructure minister did not provide a count. She said \u201chundreds\u201d of projects had been approved in recent weeks, that virtual meetings with provinces continue, and committed to share exact numbers later. MPs warned delays risk missing the short construction season; the minister said approvals would continue and announcements would follow.",
    "Key points on the \u201cmiddle tier\u201d (Welsh education context):\n- Purpose and scope: The middle tier\u2014regional school improvement consortia, local authorities, Estyn, and Welsh Government\u2014coordinates support, challenge, and implementation between schools and central policy.\n- Shift to support and self-evaluation: Development of a national evaluation and improvement resource (with OECD and Estyn) to build robust, system-wide self-evaluation; Estyn engaged as part of solutions, not only inspection.\n- Early identification and multi-agency response: New panels (school, LA, regional consortia, Estyn, WG) use broader intelligence (e.g., staff sickness, complaints, HR usage) to intervene earlier and secure sustainable improvement, especially in secondary schools.\n- Consistency and roles: A Strategic Delivery Group (Prof. Dylan Jones) is clarifying roles, reducing duplication, and building \u201ccollective efficacy\u201d for curriculum implementation. Regional working is retained for scale; performance varies across consortia, with work under way to improve consistency. Not moving to a single national service at this time.\n\nGovernment support for elderly and vulnerable people in Canada (COVID-19):\n- Direct support to seniors: One-time, tax-free payment of $300 (OAS) plus $200 (GIS) for low\u2011income seniors (up to $500 total), and earlier GST credit top-ups benefiting many seniors. An extra $20 million for the New Horizons for Seniors Program to fund services like grocery delivery and social connection.\n- Homelessness and housing: Hundreds of millions sent to shelters to expand capacity (including hotel leasing). Government reiterates National Housing Strategy goal to cut chronic homelessness by 50%.\n- Long-term care: Acknowledgement of severe LTC impacts; the Health Minister supports developing stronger national standards in collaboration with provinces/territories.\n- Broader vulnerability measures: Income supports (e.g., CERB), PPE procurement with provinces, and targeted supports for Indigenous communities, with recognition that more work is needed in some urban Indigenous settings.",
    "The marketing expert is strongly positive about the concept and pushes a premium, desire-led positioning. He emphasizes that, in this category, \u201cfancy\u201d look-and-feel and visible innovation drive purchase more than ease-of-use. He highlights the cradle with \u201cwhere\u2019s my remote\u201d locator, durability/dependability, and the scroll/favorites features as clear selling points. He recommends a 35\u201350\u20ac price aimed at a niche, more exclusive segment rather than a low-margin mass market, and proposes a lifetime, normal-use replacement guarantee to build trust. He\u2019s open to upgradability (e.g., card-based), but cautions it could complicate warranties and usability.\n\nOn user identification, he advocates adding speech recognition as the signature \u201csmart\u201d differentiator. He favors speaker-dependent recognition so the remote can identify who is using it, enabling parental control and personalized behaviors (e.g., remembering a user\u2019s common channels and volume). He notes multi-user households might push toward speaker-independent recognition but accepts the complexity/cost trade-offs. He also suggests reusing the speech system to locate the remote by voice instead of clapping.\n\nAesthetically, he first proposes silvers/blacks to match TVs, but later steers toward trend-led designs: rounded, rubbery \u201cspongy\u201d forms with fruit/vegetable-inspired colors, plus options like glow-in-the-dark and customizable panels/backlight colors\u2014positioned as paid upgrades for users who want to stand out (especially younger buyers).\n\nPractically, he prefers conventional batteries over solar (\u201cdon\u2019t reinvent the wheel\u201d) and believes the product\u2019s distinctiveness can outweigh some compatibility gaps, reducing returns because customers will value the novel features.",
    "- Universal adoption (Welsh Baccalaureate): \u201cUniversal\u201d was defined as universal availability and entitlement, not a blanket obligation. The aim is for the Bac to become the norm post\u201116, with flexibility where it is not in a learner\u2019s best interests (e.g., wellbeing, specific needs). Ministers will rely on clearer performance measures, strengthened professional learning, and improved guidance/communications (including to FE) rather than pausing rollout. Where institutions insist all learners take it, guidance may be clarified to ensure justified exceptions.\n\n- Advantages of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015: The Act was intended to (1) regulate Welsh HE providers in a loans\u2011based funding era, (2) safeguard public benefit from public funding, (3) maintain fair access, and (4) protect institutional autonomy. It gave HEFCW new intervention powers, enabled proportionate regulation tied to public funding, and\u2014together with ministerial remit letters\u2014supported national priorities (e.g., living wage, ethical procurement, transparency on senior pay, mental health initiatives). It preserved autonomy while allowing oversight, and worked alongside established QA arrangements (QAA/Estyn).\n\n- Weaknesses and lessons: Evidence was mixed on whether all four objectives were fully met. HEFCW described powers as cumbersome for swift, preventative action and lacking sufficiently graduated steps between \u201csoft\u201d engagement and severe sanctions. Fee and access plans were seen as bureaucratic, input\u2011focused, and too short\u2011term (annual), with limited confidence in impact; a shift to multi\u2011year, outcome\u2011focused agreements is planned. The Act\u2019s charity requirement limits regulation of some private/alternative providers; it does not permit regulation of most postgraduate fees and offers limited levers on part\u2011time fees (though no urgent need was identified). It focused on individual institutions rather than incentivising collaboration, did not directly tackle governance weaknesses, and created complexities in QA responsibilities across FE/HE. Overall, the Government will replace the Act via the PCET Bill, embedding outcome agreements, more flexible/regulatory gradations, stronger collaboration, future\u2011proofing (including for TNE/private provision), while retaining institutional autonomy.",
    "The team formalized evaluation as a quick, repeatable scorecard derived from earlier user requirements. Marketing (Cat) presented the framework: a 1\u20137 scale (1 = strongly meets/true; 7 = does not meet/false), with criteria originally labeled A\u2013D but expanded into a checklist. Each member scored independently; results were averaged to guide decisions and flag risks.\n\nKey criteria and discussion points:\n- Match to user behavior and ergonomics: Strong for right\u2011handers; left\u2011hand bias and flip\u2011open handling noted as risks to flag for management. RSI concerns mitigated by soft materials and minimal primary buttons.\n- Intuitiveness and learnability: Basic functions clear, but departures from the standard 3\u00d73+1 number layout and the scroll wheel introduce a learning curve. They separated \u201ceasy to use\u201d from \u201ceasy to learn.\u201d\n- Functionality vs simplicity: Core TV tasks (volume, channel, power) prioritized; menus and multi\u2011use buttons cover advanced features. Simplicity generally scored well; complexity kept off the surface.\n- Fashion/brand fit: Fruit/vegetable inspiration (potato/banana), corporate colors (yellow/black), and visible logo evaluated positively for distinctiveness and appeal, with alternates for conservative users.\n- Innovation/technology: Components are familiar, but application (form factor, scroll input, base station/locator) seen as fresh enough; not bleeding\u2011edge.\n- \u201cDon\u2019t lose it\u201d feature: Color/shape help; electronic locator debated. Cost trade\u2011offs led to a simple beeper over a pricier speaker; RF locator tied to base station in later concept.\n- Market fit and purchase intent: Mixed\u2014stronger among younger, trend\u2011oriented users; some resistance to overt \u201cbanana\u201d styling.\n\nOutcomes: mid\u2011range averages reflecting good basics with learnability and handedness risks; action items included possible mirrored (left\u2011hand) variant, clearer number layout/labels, user testing (focus groups), and cost-trimming swaps to stay within the \u20ac12.5\u2013\u20ac25 target.",
    "- CDs for backup: Participants were skeptical about using recordable CDs/DVDs as archival media. Burned discs were reported to degrade in as little as 1\u20133 years (often failing unpredictably), and even pressed CDs can degrade over time. Conclusion: do not rely on CDs as the only copy. Preferred plan is to keep data on inexpensive non\u2013backed-up disks and perform one-time archival to tape (using the existing tape robot/NW archive). Re-burning CDs yearly was floated but seen as impractical. They also discussed adding more disk capacity and possibly a new file server; tapes remain the long-term archive.\n\n- Probability computation: For inferring the user\u2019s navigation intention (Enter, View/Vista, Approach/Tango), they proposed Bayesian belief networks with intermediate nodes per information source (discourse, ontology/entity properties, user model, situational context). To avoid huge CPTs, they favored combining \u201cexpert\u201d sub-decisions via weighted voting (averaging) and, more generally, a mixture-of-experts with a hidden selector (H) that chooses which expert to trust per case. They emphasized avoiding loops, decomposing features, and possibly learning weights/structures if data suffice; otherwise hand-setting priors. Tools considered included JavaBayes and Kevin Murphy\u2019s toolkit, with features/data represented in XML.\n\n- Experimental setup for the computer navigation system: A Wizard-of-Oz lab study simulates a mobile tourist assistant. Subjects view a 3D/QuickTime scene of Heidelberg, are told the system knows their GPS position, and complete tasks (e.g., get to a place to buy stamps; take a picture). Mid-session the \u201csystem\u201d crashes, and a human operator continues, yielding both human-computer and human-human dialogues in one session. Audio is captured in an instrumented room with synchronized close-talking and multiple far-field microphones to support both linguistic and acoustic research. The system aims to distinguish Vista/Enter/Tango, factoring in object type, opening times, and time of day.",
    "- Symmetrical buttons on both sides: The team rejected mirroring channel and volume controls on both edges because it would hurt ease of use. Marketing noted it was technically possible but would likely reduce simplicity; the Project Manager explicitly said usability would be \u201ca lot more difficult,\u201d and the UI lead agreed. When a flip-over design was floated as an alternative, the PM concluded the basic functions were simple enough that even left\u2011handed users wouldn\u2019t struggle, so they kept a conventional, single-sided layout.\n\n- Right- and left-handed versions at the prototype presentation: When the PM observed the prototype might necessitate separate right\u2011 and left\u2011handed models, the UI lead said producing both was feasible. However, Marketing and the Industrial Designer argued a dedicated left\u2011handed unit wasn\u2019t necessary: families typically share one remote, left\u2011handers commonly use right\u2011handed mice without issue, and this device only requires pressing buttons. The Industrial Designer added they could offer both versions, and Marketing acknowledged that as an option, but the discussion ended without a commitment to dual SKUs. The PM moved on, praising the concept rather than mandating separate models. In later scoring, the team even noted it would score best if both handed versions existed, but otherwise accepted that the current design is somewhat right\u2011hand\u2013biased. Overall, the sentiment leaned toward keeping a single model and treating a left\u2011handed variant as optional rather than a core requirement.",
    "The team faced a strict production-cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50 and concluded the initial concept was \u201cway above\u201d that. They explored savings and, in one early pass, showed costs could drop to about \u20ac12.40 by removing both the solar cells and voice recognition. In the final redesign, they prioritized keeping the LCD and essential pushbuttons for usability. Dropping voice recognition alone still left costs near \u20ac13, so they also removed the \u201cspecial\u201d yellow color from the base unit, standardizing it to black/grey to hit the \u20ac12.50 target.\n\nThey debated materials and form. Plastic would be cheaper, but marketing and the PM argued to retain the rubber \u201cspongy\u201d casing for durability, grip, and differentiation. They also chose to keep the distinctive \u201cbanana\u201d curve to stand out, while acknowledging that more exotic options\u2014titanium casing, double-curved housing, solar power, and a kinetic energy source\u2014were too costly or conflicted with other goals and were therefore abandoned. With voice recognition gone, related elements (e.g., a program/training button) became unnecessary.\n\nTheir cost-reduction strategy centered on: removing high-cost features (voice, solar), standardizing finishes (base black/grey), minimizing unique parts, and avoiding exotic housings. To preserve trendiness without burdening the base cost, they proposed optional, paid interchangeable covers, allowing customization while manufacturing a single, low-cost core product. The team agreed the LCD delivers more value than voice recognition at this price; if customers want voice, it would require a higher price or dropping the LCD. Management\u2019s mandate was clear: stay under \u20ac12.50 or the project is a no\u2011go, so the final package reflects those trade-offs.",
    "Pros\n- Strong market appeal: Research indicated a \u201cvast majority\u201d would pay more for more intuitive control like voice, making it a potential selling point and differentiator.\n- Fits target users: The team leaned toward a 15\u201335 (esp. 25\u201335) demographic that\u2019s gadget-friendly with disposable income; voice scored highly with them.\n- Perceived simplicity/high-tech: Delivers a high-tech feel while promising easier operation; could help keep the surface uncluttered by replacing some buttons.\n- Accessibility: Could benefit users with physical disabilities.\n- Optional/controllable: Can be implemented as an opt-in feature (activate/deactivate), or limited to simple actions (e.g., power, mute), reducing risk of overcomplexity.\n\nCons\n- Reliability concerns: Prior experiences showed poor performance (\u201cyelling at the control\u201d), suggesting tech maturity may not yet meet expectations.\n- Cost impact: Likely expensive to integrate, challenging the target price point (~\u20ac25 retail) and overall cost constraints.\n- Power/battery life: Microphone and processing increase power draw; could pressure battery life and complicate decisions about rechargeable vs. standard batteries.\n- Transmission/ergonomics conflict: With IR, holding the remote near the mouth for speech may block line of sight to the TV, reducing reliability unless the design or transmission method changes.\n- Time-to-market and complexity: Company cautioned against complexity; adding voice may delay delivery and divert focus from the core \u201csimple TV-only\u201d brief.\n- Not universally suitable: Voice may be good for some functions and poor for others; the industrial designer urged defining functions first and avoiding lock-in to a single technology.",
    "Battery options were weighed against size, cost, ease of use, and longevity. The Industrial Designer\u2019s general requirements were a long\u2011lasting, low\u2011cost power source that enables a compact form factor and reliable IR transmission, with minimal user maintenance. He flagged most current remotes as \u201cchunky\u201d because of battery size and urged shrinking the power system.\n\nOptions discussed:\n- AA/AAA cells: Cheap and ubiquitous; AAA can thin the device versus AA. However, he argued even AAA makes the housing bulky and compromises the sleek design goal.\n- Coin/lithium cells: Much smaller, but he cautioned about matching power consumption and availability.\n- Rechargeable pack + charger cradle: Pros\u2014long runtime, no buying batteries, and the dock could host a \u201cfind my remote\u201d beeper. Cons\u2014added hardware/space and possible budget impact.\n- Dynamo/wind\u2011up: Rejected as impractical and bulky (requires a handle).\n- Solar: Would need visible panels, is fragile if dropped, less effective under artificial light/night use, and adds cost/visual clutter.\n- Kinetic (self\u2011charging like a watch): Favored for novelty and practicality; motion charges a small \u201cwatch\u2011type\u201d storage cell, which is adequate because a remote only sends brief bursts. No user action or battery purchases.\n\nConserving battery life: he proposed standby when idle and auto\u2011timeout on any keypad backlighting (e.g., off after 5\u201310 seconds).\n\nDecision on battery type: The team chose kinetic charging with a small watch\u2011style storage cell, explicitly not AA/AAA, solar, or dynamo.\n\nWhy he recommended a charger (earlier) for the industrial working design: To meet the \u201clong\u2011lasting, minimal maintenance\u201d requirement and reduce battery replacement hassle, he endorsed a cradle like mobile phones use; it keeps the remote topped up and could integrate the locator beeper. As component constraints and design direction evolved, the team pivoted to the cleaner kinetic solution.",
    "- To test whether there\u2019s a publishable story: following Nancy\u2019s advice (\u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you have a paper until you write it\u201d), they wanted to draft it and get Jerry\u2019s feedback.\n\n- Good venue fit: the target conference is explicitly interdisciplinary (cognitive, neural, psycholinguistic motivations for NLP), aligning with their construction-grammar approach, Bayes-net architecture (SUDO: Situation, User, Discourse, Ontology), and cognitively plausible design.\n\n- Feasible scope for a short paper: they can present a focused \u201cWhere is X?\u201d case as a position/architecture paper\u2014outline parsing/understanding, show how discourse and ontology cues feed the Bayes net, and discuss intention uncertainty (info-seeking vs go-there) without needing full evaluation.\n\n- Documenting progress: even if rejected, a write-up usefully records six months of work (formalism, generation XML, ontology/discourse integration), which the team views as valuable in itself.\n\n- Driving design clarity: committing the design to paper forces concrete decisions about input/output nodes, discourse features, and ontology interfaces, and enables initial runs with JavaBayes to inspect outputs and refine assumptions.\n\n- Novelty and contribution framing: they want to argue that seemingly simple utterances are highly ambiguous in real discourse, challenging oversimplified treatments in the literature, and to present their ontology-driven discourse lookup and intention inference as a principled alternative.\n\n- Strategic visibility: potentially two complementary papers (different perspectives) to position the project within the community and stimulate collaboration.\n\n- Timing/practicality: the short format (\u22484\u20136 pages) supports a concise architecture-plus-example paper they can assemble quickly, making productive use of imminent system pieces and upcoming data, with minimal risk and clear upside.",
    "- Funding for the consortia: Williams backed routing in\u2011year professional learning money to schools via the regional consortia, not earmarking it centrally. She said challenge advisers and headteachers should diagnose local needs and target spend accordingly (including, where relevant, improving Welsh Bacc delivery). She stressed school\u2011level autonomy with accountability, while also noting wider skills funding (e.g., \u00a310m aligned to Regional Skills Partnerships) to better match provision to employer demand.\n\n- University governance: She accepted governance needed strengthening. Although the 2015 HE Act didn\u2019t directly fix governance, she has:\n  - Supported an independent, sector\u2011led review chaired by Gillian Camm (Universities Wales/HEFCW).\n  - Begun meeting governing\u2011body chairs separately from vice\u2011chancellors.\n  - Sought better board diversity (noting low BME representation) and stronger staff/student voice.\n  - Backed national training with AdvanceHE.\n  - Is exploring a \u201cgood governance\u201d regulatory condition in the forthcoming PCET Bill.\n\n- University mergers: She is not pursuing a mergers policy. Her priority is a strong, sustainable sector; mergers should be institution\u2011led and demonstrably in students\u2019 interests. She welcomed collaboration (e.g., joint ITE bids) and said HEFCW is reviewing past reconfigurations to learn lessons. No plans to change this stance unless events require it.\n\n- Admissions problems and solutions: She acknowledged Wales\u2019 distinctive fall in EU applications, driven by the end of the Welsh tuition\u2011fee grant for EU students and Brexit uncertainty, alongside a demographic dip. Actions include:\n  - Guaranteeing EU student support for the next academic year and working on Erasmus/Horizon contingencies.\n  - A \u00a33.5m Global Wales/Study in Wales international marketing push (targeting, e.g., the US and Vietnam).\n  - Pressing UK Government to remove students from migration targets and widen post\u2011study visa access (now extended to Cardiff and UWTSD).\n  - Ongoing oversight with HEFCW and institutions on preparedness, and urging universities to sharpen their offer (curriculum, teaching quality, facilities).",
    "Energy source: The team surveyed multiple options\u2014standard batteries (AAA vs. lithium), a rechargeable base, solar, hand\u2011dynamo, and kinetic. They rejected a bulky charging base to keep the remote small, and dropped solar because the soft, changeable covers would block panels. Early consensus favored a small, battery\u2011only unit (leaning toward lithium over AAA for weight and modernity). In the final costing session, they committed to kinetic power as the primary energy approach, identifying it as the key differentiator. (Earlier battery discussions informed size/weight targets; the final choice positions kinetic as the main source, with simple electronics.)\n\nTechnological innovation: Several ideas were explored\u2014side scroll/push controls, full voice recognition, and a \u201cfinder\u201d/locator. Full voice control was deemed complex, costly, and prone to false triggers, so they did not adopt it. The principal innovation finalized was kinetic energy. Secondary user\u2011experience innovations include illuminated buttons-on-press, tactile/shape cues, side-mounted channel/volume controls that require a deliberate press, and an ergonomic curved form with optional fashion covers.\n\nOverall evaluation: Using a 7\u2011point scale, they assessed ease of use, fashion, feel, innovation, handedness, and likelihood of getting lost. The prototype was praised as comfortable, simple, and \u201ccute/beautiful,\u201d with strong fashion appeal (gunmetal/black base, customizable covers). Innovation was rated positively but not maximal (kinetic is new; other electronics remain simple). They noted a right\u2011hand bias (mitigations discussed) and judged it unlikely to get lost (size, visibility; locator considered). Costs fit the budget (<\u20ac12.50 components), and the team concluded the design is marketable and a \u201cwinner.\u201d",
    "- Technical issues: The team agreed to keep the design simple, robust, and low-cost. They favored infrared (IR) for universal TV compatibility and rejected Bluetooth because TVs don\u2019t support it and it would add cost/complexity. Teletext support was dropped, and scope was narrowed to TV-only to hit time-to-market. They rejected LCDs, spinning/scroll wheels, and \u201cchip-on-print\u201d advanced electronics as too costly or RSI-unfriendly, preferring a low-cost PCB with simple rubber push-buttons. A 4\u2011way ring/rocker was considered for channel/volume. Likely buttons: power, channel \u00b1, volume \u00b1, full numeric keypad (still debated but leaning yes), plus a lock key; glow-in-the-dark/backlighting and a \u201cfind my remote\u201d function were explored (audio beacon favored over lights, though complexity/cost needs checking).\n\n- Energy source: Options surveyed included standard batteries, hand dynamo, kinetic/energy-harvesting (like watches), solar, and hybrids. The group converged on a spongy, double\u2011curved rubber, anti\u2011RSI case that can be squeezed (and even tossed) to harvest kinetic energy to top up internal batteries. Pure indoor solar was doubted; a hybrid solar/rechargeable or a cheap charging cradle were discussed as possible complements if costs permit.\n\n- Project announcement email: The project manager said instructions/assignments (industrial design: look/feel; UI: layout/controls; marketing: requirements/positioning) would be sent by email between meetings, joked about \u201cspam,\u201d and noted further coordination with leadership; team members were told to expect an email with next steps.\n\n- Sample sensor: The \u201cjust-developed sample sensor/speaker\u201d (speech feature demoed with the coffee machine) was rejected. It offered programmable call-and-response rather than true command recognition, added cost, and didn\u2019t aid TV control; a speaker in the remote was deemed unnecessary.",
    "In the final meeting, the team reviewed the prototype, costs, and readiness for launch, then made a key scope decision to meet budget.\n\nKey design/prototype points:\n- Form and feel: Single-curved, rubber-coated, durable body with a soft, \u201cspongy\u201d grip; unconventional, more natural look. Optional multi\u2011color indicator light (can be disabled).\n- Core controls: Always-on top deck with Power, Channel Up/Down, Volume Up/Down; a slide\u2011out panel provides advanced functions. Interchangeable \u201cskins\u201d/faces are feasible, with initial subdued options and potential for Apple\u2011style colors later.\n- Voice recognition: Integrated mic/sensor console on the back; works reliably within intended room range and is positioned as the primary differentiator.\n\nCost and problems reviewed:\n- Budget target was \u20ac12.50. After itemizing components (including a solar cell and back\u2011up battery), the build came in over budget (\u2248\u20ac16), contradicting earlier rough estimates.\n- The solar/back\u2011up battery hardware was the main cost driver. Keeping solar without a back\u2011up introduced reliability risks (support/call\u2011center burden for the ~1% \u201cno-light\u201d scenarios).\n- Usability: The slide\u2011out panel has a short learning curve but tests well once users acclimate. Multi\u2011color lighting could annoy some users, hence the off option. Availability and timing of additional \u201cskins\u201d remain to be finalized.\n\nDecisions/outcomes:\n- Drop the solar cell (and back\u2011up battery) for launch to hit cost targets; revisit solar when pricing improves.\n- Make voice recognition the flagship feature; retain the rubberized, ergonomic form and optional aesthetics.\n- Overall product evaluation: Meets functional and aesthetic goals; minor usability concerns are acceptable for release.",
    "Hefin David AM raised two linked sets of concerns. On higher education fee and access plans, he argued the current regime is process-heavy, input-focused and bureaucratic, with little confidence from HEFCW or universities. Annual plans are too short to show impact and early plans are still being evaluated years on. He pressed for multi\u2011year, outcome\u2011focused agreements with clearer, graduated regulatory tools between \u201csoft\u201d engagement and severe sanctions.\n\nOn the childcare offer, he questioned whether a single national rate of \u00a34.50/hour risks a \u201cno\u2011frills\u201d core with paid add\u2011ons (food, transport, consumables), disproportionately hitting the lowest\u2011income working families. He also challenged whether \u00a34.50 is viable in high\u2011cost markets such as Cardiff and Newport and asked if the sector can expand and upskill fast enough to maintain quality and qualifications at that price.\n\nHuw Irranca\u2011Davies acknowledged the administrative burden in pilots and is moving to a centralised HMRC\u2011style eligibility system. He defended \u00a34.50 as simple and generally welcomed, but will test affordability in Cardiff and Newport (from September) and is open to revising or varying rates if evidence demands it. He accepted some additional charges (often up to about \u00a37.50/day for food, transport, nappies) may be levied, noting budget constraints, but stressed transparency and partnership with providers to avoid disadvantaging poorer families. To sustain quality, he emphasised use of registered/inspected provision, links to the Foundation Phase, a 10\u2011year childcare workforce plan, targeted support for Welsh\u2011medium capacity, and \u00a360m capital for facilities. He recognised rising labour costs (e.g., National Living Wage) could pressure the model and committed to keep the \u00a34.50 rate under review in light of pilot findings and workforce needs.",
    "On-line normalization:\n- PhD C implemented on-line normalization with two separate running means (speech vs. silence) driven by the VAD posterior, plus a variable time constant that adapts quickly at utterance start and then caps to continue slow adaptation. He observed the largest mean differences in C0 and especially C1; C1 shows \u201cstrange\u201d speech\u2013silence behavior across noises. Consistent with prior findings, normalizing C0 matters, while C1 normalization doesn\u2019t help with the current scheme. He also tried per\u2013mel-band noise-flooring by adding white noise ~15 dB below each utterance\u2019s peak band energy: MFCCs became much smoother and clean/noisy channels looked similar; recognition was roughly unchanged. He found a major confound: LDA filters trained on noisy speech were suboptimal when testing mismatched; reverting to clean-trained LDA raised accuracy from 82.7% to 85.1%, arguing for standardized, fixed components during noise-compensation experiments.\n- The professor urged analyzing error patterns (insertions/deletions, quiet vs. noisy) rather than only global WER, suggested exploring different noise-addition schedules, and emphasized standardizing unchanged system pieces.\n\nPhase normalization:\n- PhD F\u2019s phase mean subtraction (long-term mean) produced \u201cgarbage.\u201d Grad G found Matlab phase unwrapping made results worse than no unwrapping. Discussion shifted to operating directly in the complex domain and dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of log-domain subtraction, with cautions about complex-log scaling/Taylor expansions.\n\nOpinions on phase normalization and quals:\n- PhD C offered no strong position on phase normalization; his stance focused on cepstral (esp. C0) normalization and careful controls.\n- The professor was skeptical of naive log-domain phase mean subtraction, open to complex-domain normalization done carefully, and broadly advocated rigorous, controlled evaluation. On quals, he did not set content but implicitly supported targeted \u201ccheating\u201d analyses (using oracle cues) to assess which intermediate categories aid recognition.",
    "The group framed \u201cimportant linguistic features\u201d as low-dimensional, largely binary articulatory/phonological variables (e.g., sonorancy, voicing, nasality). Initial targets can come from canonical phone-to-feature mappings (e.g., TIMIT), but they prefer learning them more finely: per-band hidden targets estimated with EM (as in Saul\u2019s sonorant detector), so the system can down\u2011weight unreliable evidence rather than forcing all detectors to train equally. They also discussed supplementing/validating targets via manual annotation by linguistics students or by clustering continuous articulatory measurements, recognizing that per-utterance feature truth is often hidden.\n\nFeature streams: Robustness comes from multi-stream/multi-band processing. They described combining multiple feature streams (e.g., OGI features, low\u2011pass filtered variants, parallel MLPs, KLT projections), then summing linear MLP outputs. Conceptually, they favor a soft \u201cAND\u201d across feature detectors within a band and a soft \u201cOR\u201d across bands, with per-band target activity treated as hidden. This lets the system ignore noisy bands and exploit complementary evidence.\n\nNoisy-ORs: For combining multiple cues into higher-level decisions (e.g., Enter\u2013View\u2013Approach actions), they advocated Heckerman-style Noisy-OR/related deterministic combination functions over full CPTs. Introducing intermediate Ei nodes (each \u201ceffect given one cause active, others in a default state\u201d) reduces parameters from exponential to linear in the number of cues, handles missing observations gracefully, and aligns with multi-cue evidence combination (e.g., max-like Noisy-OR or weighted evidence sums). If tools (e.g., JavaBayes) don\u2019t support this natively, they can generate CPTs from the combining function.\n\nTranscription formalization: They standardized transcripts to support both ASR and feature detection: glossing colloquials (\u201ccuz\u201d\u2192\u201cbecause\u201d), consistent disfluency tokens, acronym conventions, explicit tags for laughter/non\u2011vocal events/qualifiers, and clear separation of read numbers (NUMS) from spontaneous speech. Scripts produce ASR\u2011ready and analysis\u2011ready versions, providing reliable supervision and metadata for training and evaluating these feature detectors.",
    "- System involvement in demos: The team converged on a multi-part demo. Core pieces include a THISL-based information retrieval front end (Tcl/Tk GUI) that indexes meeting transcripts and lets users query by keywords and click-to-play audio segments; possible merging with Transcriber for a unified interface. A prosody visualization piece (stylized pitch, features for turn/sentence boundaries) will be shown, ideally inside Transcriber or via X Waves; Windows compatibility is a constraint, with Snack/Tcl/Tk workable but version-sensitive. Target: have all pieces running by month-end, then port and stabilize on the professor\u2019s laptop. For SmartKom, a minimal \u201cconcept-to-speech\u201d path is running (brittle but demo-able); a broader institute talk is envisioned once it\u2019s stable.\n\n- Backups and collecting notes: Disk usage is near capacity. Plan: acquire more disks and keep meeting data on backed-up storage; also create NW archive copies for redundancy. Avoid relying on non-backed-up scratch or CD-Rs for backup. Short-term sharing of local drives is acceptable. For notes, CrossPads were tried (time-stamped notes) but suffered from pen noise and synchronization overhead; alternative options include assigning a scribe post hoc or lightweight PDA/wireless-button time markers for highlights and sensitive-content flags. Keep one CrossPad for experiments; returning the other is fine.\n\n- Switchboard: Meetings show pervasive overlap; the group wants to quantify how much more overlap occurs versus two-party Switchboard calls (where backchannels dominate but earlier corpora made overlap hard to study). On recognition, Switchboard experiments showed PLP \u2248 Mel performance, with ~1.5% absolute gain from system combination; plans include retraining MLPs using SRI alignments.\n\n- Scheduling meetings going forward (professor\u2019s view): Alternate focus between Meeting Recorder topics and recognition/system discussions (possibly biweekly). Stay flexible; if topics pile up, add another meeting. Coordinate the plan with Liz and Jane.",
    "The committee was told that Welsh Government has ended plans to use HMRC to administer the Childcare Offer. Julie Morgan said the main driver was a principled policy choice: HMRC would constrain the flexibility needed to expand and adapt the Offer in Wales. Specifically, she wants the system to be able to include parents in education and training and to address cases such as families with no recourse to public funds\u2014changes that would have to be handled locally, not through HMRC. She also highlighted a dependency risk: because HMRC\u2019s platform underpins the English scheme, changes made for England could impede Wales\u2019s ability to tailor its offer.\n\nMorgan acknowledged there were Welsh language compliance issues too. While HMRC can provide a bilingual service under its scheme, detailed discovery work showed difficulties meeting the Welsh Ministers\u2019 language standards across multiple interconnected IT systems (including handling Welsh characters and feeds from other UK departments). Although the previous Minister had assured the committee this would not be a problem, officials accepted this should have been bottomed out earlier.\n\nCost and value for money were additional factors. Jo-Anne Daniels said HMRC\u2019s post-discovery costs were \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than first indicated; the Government believes a Welsh local-authority model will be cheaper, keep investment in Wales, and deliver better support. The decision is to move from the temporary arrangement to a permanent, single national application administered by 10 lead local authorities (current admin grant c. \u00a32.5m, ring-fenced), with total costs expected to be below HMRC\u2019s proposal.\n\nMorgan noted initial WLGA support for HMRC had shifted; local authorities now back the in-Wales approach, which they feel is closer to families and better able to manage complex cases. She thanked HMRC for a positive relationship but concluded the local model best meets Wales\u2019s needs.",
    "- Professor\u2019s workshop comment: He recalled a workshop where everyone used a P-make\u2013like dispatcher to blast jobs to all machines; with 25 people sending to 25 machines, the cluster ran less efficiently than if each person had just used a single machine.\n\n- Team\u2019s feedback on the person in Grenada: They identified Jose Carlos Segura (Granada) as a promising collaborator who has an implementation of Vector Taylor Series (VTS) techniques for modeling the clean-to-noisy cepstral transformation; they\u2019re exploring working with him as part of combining enhancement/noise-compensation methods.\n\n- Required elements in the new form arrangement: The system now uses two forms (a one-time speaker form and a digits-reading form). On the digits form, Time is listed before Date because Time is used to find the digit-reading segment in the meeting audio; Date is often pre-filled. The essentials the participant must fill out are Name, Email, and Time. Native language is collected; the \u201cRegion\u201d field is being simplified (dropping \u201cNorthern,\u201d keeping \u201cOther,\u201d possibly using freer self-description).\n\n- Suggested belief-net structure: Move from a flat \u201call features \u2192 mode\u201d design to a layered network: observed features (e.g., discourse cues like admission-fee talk, verb class, prosody, time of day, \u201cclosed,\u201d \u201cnice walls,\u201d context) feed hidden intent/state nodes (e.g., on a tour, running an errand, in a hurry), which then predict the mode (Enter/Vista/Tango). In a later refinement, separate subnets (user, situation, discourse, ontology) feed a Go-there decision, with added user-finance nodes (thrifty/budget \u2192 financial state).\n\n- Grad B\u2019s opinion on the belief-net structure: The flat model was unsatisfactory; he favored introducing (even many) middle-layer nodes for concepts. He also questioned a strict separation between features and output, proposing some direct influence (e.g., \u201cadmission fee,\u201d \u201cclosed,\u201d \u201chas door\u201d) via an intermediate \u201cwants to enter\u201d node or even direct arcs to the mode.",
    "Grad E\u2019s aim was to make mean log-magnitude spectral subtraction practical for an interactive system (SmartKom) by avoiding look\u2011ahead. He tested using only past context (about 12 seconds) versus a centered window and found the performance drop to be tiny, which he viewed as encouraging for low-latency deployment. He also probed whether training-time mean windows must match test-time windows. Training with 12-second means but testing with shorter windows (\u22484\u20138 seconds) hurt slightly (typically <0.5% absolute WER, occasionally ~0.8%), leading him to conclude that longer training windows don\u2019t help if test-time context will be short; matching train/test window lengths or ramping up context over time may be preferable. He noted open decisions (e.g., speech vs silence frames in the mean) and saw further tuning as warranted, but overall regarded the approach as viable with modest, manageable trade-offs.\n\nGrad A\u2019s goal was diagnostic: to run \u201ccheating\u201d experiments that inject oracle knowledge about intermediate categories (starting with voicing) to quantify their value for recognition. In a hybrid setup, he planned to edit LNA files to zero out posteriors of phones incompatible with known voicing during given segments (and possibly renormalize among the remaining phones), starting with TIMIT phone recognition and extending to digits to study inter-phoneme events (e.g., stop\u2192vowel transitions). He did not present results yet; his view is that these experiments would reveal which categories most improve recognition, informing future model design rather than immediately delivering a deployable system. He targeted completing these investigations by his qualifying exams.",
    "User Interface\u2019s stance:\n- Fewer physical controls: Prefer a largely buttonless, touch-based LCD with clear, large icons, a dedicated Back/Options path, and only essential hard keys (notably Power). Advanced settings should be hidden in menus or behind a cover to keep everyday use simple, especially for older users.\n- Control layout norms: Volume up/down arranged vertically; channel +/- horizontally (matching common mental models). Avoid side scroll wheels (they can be bashed where you grip the device); on\u2011screen selection is faster for small menus.\n- Form and materials: Ergonomic \u201csingle\u2011curve\u201d body that can stand in a charging dock; rubberized casing for grip and durability; company name visible on the front.\n- Speech recognition: Support adding a visible microphone and simple voice commands; it\u2019s lightweight to include and a differentiator.\n- Radio waves: In favor of RF; interference can be mitigated by using specific unlicensed bands and embedding an identification/handshake code so neighbors\u2019 remotes don\u2019t conflict.\n\nFinal decision:\n- Design: A single\u2011curved, rubber\u2011cased remote with a moderate\u2011size touchscreen, minimal hard buttons (Power prioritized), rechargeable batteries with a docking/charging stand, and company branding. Teletext is dropped; scope is TV\u2011only. Speech mic included as a highlight feature, with simple voice control.\n- Signal technology: Proceed with infrared (IR) for cost and simplicity (off\u2011the\u2011shelf electronics), keeping RF as a future option.\n- Budget use: Targeting the cost ceiling, the team will not spend additional budget on nonessential features. To control costs, extra scroll wheels are omitted and the body is flattened where possible to save roughly \u20ac2. Any remaining headroom is reserved; there\u2019s \u201cno point in spending money if we don\u2019t have to.\u201d",
    "- Effect of noise on speech frequencies: He noted a prominent very\u2011low\u2011frequency component (~5 Hz, e.g., air\u2011conditioner/handling) in PDA mics. A mild high\u2011pass option (cutoff \u224820 Hz; slight effect up to ~100 Hz) is recommended; it does not harm even low speech frequencies and PZM mics already roll off there. With distant mics, indirect energy attenuates high frequencies and distorts temporal trajectories; the example used on the web was thus a poor illustration of reverberation versus additive low\u2011frequency noise.\n\n- Noise addition vs convolution: The evaluation data are dominated by additive noise, while their legacy RASTA\u2011like (log\u2011domain) processing mainly addresses convolutional effects. He argued the system should explicitly handle additive noise in addition to existing robustness methods.\n\n- Smoothing/temporal filtering: Their LDA/RASTA FIR filters act as modulation\u2011domain low\u2011pass smoothing centered around speech\u2011rate modulations (~5 Hz). However, these FIRs incurred large latency. Proper anti\u2011alias low\u2011pass filtering should precede any downsampling.\n\n- FIR filters (latency): The original FIR bank caused ~200 ms delay. He endorsed replacing them with IIR (recursive) filters matched in magnitude response, cutting delays to ~64 ms (low band) and ~11 ms (high band), accepting slightly non\u2011linear phase because speech modulation cues are preserved.\n\n- Dealing with additive noise: He advocated mel\u2011band spectral subtraction with SNR\u2011dependent over\u2011subtraction to limit musical noise, and on\u2011line noise estimation from nonspeech regions (via VAD, histograms/thresholding). This works best for stationary or slowly varying noise; non\u2011stationary noise is harder and raises latency/estimation trade\u2011offs. He cautioned that spectral subtraction can increase feature variance and interact poorly with on\u2011line mean/variance normalization and VAD; sequencing (e.g., VAD \u2192 subtract \u2192 normalize, or layered subtraction) should be tested. Overall, combine explicit additive\u2011noise suppression with their existing methods rather than abandon them.",
    "The group defined the remote\u2019s core function as a TV-only controller to keep cost and time-to-market down, focusing on the most-used actions: power, channel, volume, numeric entry, and mute. Teletext and TV settings (audio/screen/channel) would exist in sub-menus to avoid clutter. They debated an LCD/touch UI versus physical controls; one path favored a mostly touch-driven layout with customizable icons and minimal hard keys, while another argued LCD adds cost without feedback from the TV and preferred traditional controls. Across concepts, the \u201cobject\u201d should be ergonomic for one-handed use (ambidextrous), mid-sized so it\u2019s harder to lose, slim (~1.5 cm), and durable: plastic inner shell with a rubberized exterior for grip and drop resistance. A bright, \u201cfruity\u201d color line targets younger users, with optional classic covers.\n\nOn energy, the team explored kinetic (hand\u2011dynamo) and solar. Solar was rejected (night use), and kinetic was judged eco-friendly and marketable but over budget; they cut it to meet the ~\u20ac12.50 build target. The preferred solution is rechargeable batteries with a docking/charging cradle; some variants add a base \u201clocator\u201d to ping the remote.\n\nThey also developed a \u201croll through favorites\u201d concept. A scroll wheel was debated for cost vs. uniqueness and usability. The agreed value case: let users program a favorites list (e.g., 01, 05, 38) and \u201croll\u201d through those channels, with a mode switch to toggle between sequential channel up/down and favorites-only scrolling. Indicators (LED or backlit buttons) would show the active mode. They noted TV response speed variability but accepted it as a learnable quirk. In the higher\u2011end configuration, the team favored scroll wheel + cradle + locator as distinctive features.",
    "- Demographic marketing strategy and design: The team chose an exclusive, premium positioning over mass-market, targeting primarily 18\u201335-year-olds, with pricing in the ~\u20ac35\u2013\u20ac50 retail range (accepting lower margins if needed). To appeal to varied tastes within this demographic, they proposed customization: changeable faceplates/skins and multiple case colors/materials (e.g., wood/earth tones alongside silver/black). They also planned eco-friendly features (solar with backup battery) to attract environmentally conscious buyers and discussed piloting casing options pre-launch. A lifetime \u201cnormal-use\u201d guarantee was floated to build trust for a new brand.\n\n- Industrial Design \u00d7 Marketing agreement on appearance: Both sides converged on a durable, double\u2011curved, rubberized, \u201corganic\u201d aesthetic with a soft, tactile feel; simple, familiar rubber buttons for core functions; and optional skins/faceplates. They aligned on offering several colorways and potentially non-traditional, \u201cnon\u2011remote\u2011looking\u201d forms that look good on a table. Marketing\u2019s early \u201csilvers and blacks\u201d suggestion evolved into shared support for natural/earth tones while avoiding sterile \u201csurgical white.\u201d\n\n- Industrial Designer\u2019s marketing-plan proposal: Lead with fashion and desirability\u2014an iPod-like, instantly \u201cwantable\u201d object (\u201cdon\u2019t care what it does, as long as it looks cool\u201d), mitigate market risk via multiple case styles to suit different tastes, and differentiate with small novelties (e.g., visible-light signaling) and eco cues (solar).\n\n- Marketing\u2019s view of what\u2019s marketable: They praised the prototype\u2019s \u201cwhere\u2019s my remote\u201d locator/base as immediately marketable. While calling a touch screen the most marketable headline feature, they deemed it too costly now. Instead, they backed voice recognition as the near-term hero feature\u2014already validated by research and in-house tech\u2014paired with an easy UI, ergonomic, reliable, environmentally sensitive build, and premium/exclusive positioning.",
    "- Capturing the subject intention:\n  \u2022 Grad G: Favored a more natural setup where subjects pick high-level goals (shopping, sightseeing) and note them on a map, so their \u201ctrue\u201d aims are known without prompting their wording. He wanted tasks that are unambiguous with respect to the three modes (Enter/View/Approach), but also urged keeping inference separate (no hard\u2011coded shortcuts) so additional context (e.g., meeting a friend at a bakery) can override defaults. He discussed binding across schemas and accepted that \u201cintention\u201d and action structures may be redundant but useful.\n  \u2022 The professor: Preferred not to use the term \u201cintention,\u201d focusing instead on identifying compact decision variables and using knowledge-engineering to avoid combinatorics. Emphasized extracting evidence from dialogue history, ontology, context, and prosody, and building reusable mechanisms (trajector/source\u2011path\u2011goal, constructions) to inform a belief\u2011net decision about mode.\n\n- MSG:\n  \u2022 The professor: Considered MSG promising but, given current underperformance (e.g., Italian digits) and time pressure, advised de\u2011prioritizing it short\u2011term unless a clear, quick fix emerges; focus instead on training data/targets and integration. Long\u2011term exploration remains worthwhile.\n\n- Pronouncing \u201czero\u201d:\n  \u2022 The professor: Accepted both \u201coh\u201d and \u201czero\u201d as valid pronunciations and preferred subjects read digits as they naturally would, rather than enforcing one form on the prompt sheets.\n\n- Hiring Fey:\n  \u2022 The professor: Strongly supportive\u2014praised her wizarding performance, recommended putting her on payroll, and saw her organizing subjects and learning useful experimental skills.\n  \u2022 Grad G: No explicit hiring stance, but interacted positively (light humor) and offered to help recruit via class and department channels, indicating practical support.",
    "- Appearance design: He consistently argued for a simple, uncluttered handset: small/sleek, not \u201coverbuilt,\u201d with few, larger primary buttons (power, channel, volume) that are always accessible. Advanced options should be hidden in menus rather than exposed as many keys. He was open to a full touch screen with menu/sub\u2011menus\u2014especially since the target is younger users\u2014but cautioned that older caretakers might still prefer tactile buttons, so core controls must remain physically available.\n\n- Speech recognition: He liked the idea in principle but doubted it could be delivered at the target cost. He was \u201cnot convinced we can put it into this box for the price,\u201d so he advised against full-blown speech recognition. As a pragmatic alternative, he suggested a limited voice-triggered locator (\u201cWhere is the remote?\u201d \u2192 remote beeps), noting it could be useful, though costs would need checking.\n\n- Bluetooth and other new technologies: After dissecting existing remotes, he concluded infrared should remain the transmit method. Adding Bluetooth/RF would force the TV to have the same radios, raising user cost and complexity, so his personal recommendation was to avoid Bluetooth/RF in the handset under the current budget. If wireless enhancements are desired, he proposed placing Bluetooth/RF in a TV-side placeholder/dock linked to the TV, while keeping the remote itself IR. He also advised against building receivers (e.g., for teletext feedback) into the remote due to cost/complexity, and favored simple feedback like an indicator light to confirm button presses.\n\nFor children, he supported keeping parental controls as a separate menu and ensuring parents/elders can always use the fundamental controls even if a child has navigated deeper features.",
    "- Priority of inspections (Estyn): Janet Finch\u2011Saunders pressed how and how often regional consortia are scrutinized. Jassa Scott explained that consortia are not statutory bodies, so Estyn does not have direct inspection powers over them. Both aligned on the current priority: Estyn will use a thematic programme to scrutinize consortia, starting with how each supports curriculum reform, while continuing to assess their impact through local\u2011authority inspections. They also noted planned, deeper attention to ERW (south\u2011west and mid Wales) given governance risks, including surveying schools and undertaking a focused visit.\n\n- Reopening the House of Commons and Canada\u2019s diplomatic stance: Opposition members demanded a full re\u2011opening of Parliament with all powers by September 21, arguing democratic oversight is essential and tying the government\u2019s limited sittings to a weak foreign posture, especially toward China and Hong Kong. Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez said the objective is a full return when public\u2011health conditions allow, noting the hybrid sittings and extended questioning. Foreign Affairs Minister Fran\u00e7ois\u2011Philippe Champagne, meanwhile, emphasized Canada\u2019s coordination with allies (U.S., U.K., Australia) in voicing deep concerns over Beijing\u2019s proposed national security law for Hong Kong and said Canada would assess implications; Trade Minister Mary Ng confirmed Canada is not negotiating a free\u2011trade agreement with China.\n\n- Funds and addressing systemic racism: In exchanges led by Jagmeet Singh, Justin Trudeau affirmed systemic racism exists across Canadian institutions, said the government is taking \u201csignificant, bold\u201d actions, and highlighted investments in community\u2011based solutions (Black communities, Indigenous partners). On reallocating funds (e.g., \u201cdefunding\u201d police), he did not commit to cuts but said the government has been increasing direct community investments and \u201cwill look at all expenditures,\u201d including the RCMP, to ensure money supports the right outcomes, while acknowledging the need for substantial institutional reform.",
    "The team aligned on a minimalist, menu-driven remote that favors ease of use, trendiness, and distinct styling over cutting-edge tech. Functionally, they debated multi\u2011device control but kept a fallback of an excellent TV\u2011only remote. Core interactions use four directional buttons plus an on/off switch, driving on\u2011screen menus to avoid a clutter of keys. Infrared is the transmission method; a \u201clost-remote\u201d locator (TV-triggered beeper) is desired but not yet designed. They discussed lock and backlight, shock resistance, and potential waterproofing. Power was explored as kinetic (hand\u2011crank) but they ultimately converged on standard batteries with a simple hatch for easy insertion.\n\nPrototypes included a curved \u201cscroll/blob\u201d and a banana-shaped model (both envisioned in bright yellow with black buttons). Each is small, hand\u2011holdable, and uses the same four-button layout. The IR diode sits at the tip (the banana \u201cstalk\u201d on that variant). Hard plastic was preferred for structural rigidity, with optional spongy rubber covers considered. Fruit-themed shapes were fun but raised ergonomics issues; the group leaned toward a comfortable, single-curved form with fruit colors/patterns or interchangeable covers.\n\nDetailed design and costing set a plastic case (single curve), rubber buttons, and standard push\u2011button electronics. Battery access via a side/back hatch; IR at the front; locator beeper location TBD. Costing came in well under the \u20ac12.50/\u00a312.50 target (estimates around 9.20\u201311.9), supporting healthy margins.\n\nMarketing\u2019s requirements\u2014elegant, trendy, attractive, sellable, and easy to use\u2014guided evaluation. The prototype scored an average ~1.88 (1=true, 7=false), with the only \u201cfalse\u201d tied to deliberately retaining simple, proven push\u2011button technology rather than advanced input methods.",
    "Process. The team followed short individual work blocks followed by group reviews. They used a seven\u2011point evaluation against user, fashion, feel, innovation, and \u201csquishy/fruity\u201d criteria, discussed outliers, and iterated. Creativity was mixed: prototyping with clay and play\u2011dough was stimulating, but some felt constrained by being limited to a TV\u2011only remote. Team members liked laptops, shared network, and digital pens; several disliked PowerPoint and found the meeting/recording tools of limited value. Information access was uneven (PM lacked links others had). Overall, they judged teamwork good and leadership light but sufficient.\n\nWork division. Roles were defined\u2014Project Manager (coordination, budget), Industrial Designer (form, materials), User Interface (layout, usability), Marketing (requirements, market trends, evaluation table). In practice, roles blurred and everyone contributed ideas. Marketing led the scoring framework; the PM managed the cost model; UI raised ergonomics and battery/locator concerns; ID translated fruit/shape concepts into manufacturable forms.\n\nProduction plan. Target retail price was \u20ac25 with a strict unit cost ceiling of \u20ac12.50. A component cost spreadsheet put them near \u20ac11.9\u2013\u20ac12.5, implying acceptable margin. Materials: plastic base (gunmetal gray), black labeling, single-curved underside. Features: illuminated keys, push-buttons (no scroll wheel), optional voice recognition (drives MCU choice), IR, and interchangeable soft base. Batteries: agreed on lithium over AAA; hatch-style compartment, likely on the side/back. Unresolved items: locator/beeper design, final ergonomics/size, number of input interfaces, and whether to remain TV\u2011only vs. universal. Ergonomics prompted a shift from literal fruit shapes toward a comfortable standard shape with fruit colors/patterns. Overall, they deemed the concept trendy, within budget, and promising, with usability and scope decisions left for the next iteration.",
    "- Future directions: Under time pressure, the team will retrain nets with corrected online normalization, narrow the experiment set, and focus on combinations (multi-band, feature fusion) and integration with OGI\u2019s LDA/LogRASTA pipeline and VAD. Short-term deprioritizations include MSG/JRASTA tinkering unless a quick fix appears. They\u2019ll test stream weighting via HTK variance scaling, consider larger nets or multiple smaller nets tailored to conditions, and explore new training targets (articulatory/place/manner features or regression targets) to reduce task/language/noise dependency. Longer-term: multi-band trained on many noises, articulatory-style targets, and evaluating best blends with Alcatel/FT methods while staying within CPU/memory limits.\n\n- PhD D\u2019s multilingual model/results: Four setups were compared for TI-digits/Italian: (1) task-matched same language: baseline (factor 1.0). (2) Same language, different task (e.g., TIMIT): ~1.1\u00d7 error. (3) Broad 3-language (Eng/Fr/Sp): ~1.3\u00d7 error; surprisingly, (4) excluding the target language is similar to including it. Bigger, more diverse training hurt with the same net size (capacity issue). Cross-task mismatch hurt more than cross-language; JRASTA helped in highly mismatched cases, slightly worse in matched ones. Correcting online normalization should modestly improve all numbers.\n\n- PhD C\u2013professor on multiple languages: They questioned single multilingual nets versus multiple nets by language/condition. Given limited data/parameters and noisy labels (vs hand-labeled TIMIT), mixing languages degraded performance; better to use several condition-specific MLPs or new targets (articulatory/broad classes) and fuse them, rather than one broad multilingual net.\n\n- Data release and \u201ccutting things out\u201d: Plan to email participants a release date with a review page enabling redactions (\u201cbleeps\u201d). Debate centered on requiring explicit acknowledgements versus default release; suggested adding clear deadlines, receipt tracking or follow-up calls for non-responders, and allowing post-release takedowns. They discussed how to bleep audio, manage versions/storage, and ensure transcript corrections before wider distribution.",
    "Ms. Jenny Kwan was highlighting an implementation gap: the federal government is announcing programs and citing strategies, but the design and delivery on the ground are not reaching many of the people who need help most, quickly or fairly.\n\nShe gave concrete examples. First, single parents who rely on spousal and child maintenance lost that income during COVID-19, yet CERB rules and administration didn\u2019t address this known problem despite the Employment Minister being aware for weeks. That shows how a program\u2019s intent (income support) isn\u2019t translating into timely fixes for obvious edge cases, leaving families without support.\n\nSecond, on homelessness and housing, Kwan pointed out there is no national standard to guide a pandemic response, resulting in uneven access to basics like washrooms and inconsistent measures across communities. While hotels were used short term, she pressed for federal matching funds and recognition of housing as a right to secure permanent solutions\u2014again, moving from announcements to enforceable, adequately funded implementation.\n\nThird, she underscored inequitable delivery to urban Indigenous people: Vancouver East has the third-largest urban Indigenous population but received under 2% of the pandemic urban Indigenous housing funds. That allocation outcome belies the government\u2019s stated commitment, illustrating the disconnect between policy objectives and actual distribution.\n\nIn short, Kwan\u2019s point is that speed and headline commitments are not enough; without targeted eligibility fixes, clear national standards, and fair, needs-based allocations, vulnerable groups fall through the cracks. She was pressing the government to close that gap now with concrete, operational changes, not future promises.",
    "- Project Manager\u2019s view of the last meeting and market research: In reviewing the prior meeting, the PM said the team aligned on developing a voice-recognition TV remote with a non-traditional form, basic TV controls on the surface, and a slide/fold-out panel for advanced functions, and tasked UI/ID to prototype. On market research, the PM largely deferred to marketing but used the findings to steer toward fewer buttons, stronger aesthetics, and possibly targeting a specific demographic. The PM acknowledged younger users\u2019 willingness to pay for voice control while personally doubting speech recognition\u2019s reliability and \u201cgimmick\u201d risk.\n\n- PM\u2019s perception of their presentation content and project progress: The PM portrayed themselves as the secretary/minute-taker and noted their slides arrived pre-populated (unlike others\u2019), which shaped a more structured, confident narrative (minutes, cost breakdown, evaluation handoffs). They admitted not fully understanding the \u201cconcepts\u201d phase, reframing it as \u201cproposed ideas,\u201d yet felt they \u201cslipped into\u201d the role, found the process productive with timely information, and planned to consolidate outcomes in a final report. They recognized budget pressure forced hard trade-offs.\n\n- Why the group\u2019s view differed from the PM\u2019s: Several members reported that information flow dropped sharply later; some received no material for the final presentation and had blank slides, leading to more guesswork, less confidence, and a sense of limited collaboration/time. Feature-wise, the group favored cutting the solar cell and making voice recognition the differentiator, while the PM remained wary of SR practicality and framed the solar/battery decision as an \u201ceither/or.\u201d\n\n- Group\u2019s thoughts on using a panther drawing: They found a panther hard to draw; it prompted jokes about the Pink Panther. Marketing liked the panther\u2019s sleek, powerful image, but the group moved to easier subjects (e.g., an elephant).",
    "- Buttons for multiple operations: The Industrial Designer floated mode-based, multi-operation buttons (one button doing different things in different modes). Marketing and the UI lead opposed this, citing ease-of-use and the steep learning curve users report with current remotes. They favored one-button-per-primary-function with clear, tactile differentiation (shapes/labels) to help all users, especially elderly users. Conclusion: avoid multi-mode buttons; keep dedicated buttons for frequent actions.\n\n- LCD screen: Marketing strongly pushed for an LCD for speed, feedback without interrupting the TV picture, and \u201csizzle.\u201d Despite cost concerns and the need for an advanced IC, the team agreed an LCD is a key concept. They converged on a flip-open design: minimalist exterior; inside, an LCD (often described as touch-capable in later discussion) paired with a spinning wheel for menu navigation. Placement (top vs bottom) remained debated, but the presence of an LCD was affirmed.\n\n- Microphone position: Voice recognition was included as a differentiating feature. The team discussed placing the microphone on the bottom/edge (discreet and practical) versus making it more visible to signal the feature\u2019s importance. No final location was set, but there was a lean toward a visible, \u201cimportant\u201d spot while acknowledging the mic is physically small.\n\n- Push-buttons within the key concept: Push-buttons remain essential\u2014especially for power, 0\u20139, volume, and channel. These core buttons stay on the exterior for immediate use; everything else becomes menu-driven on the internal LCD with the spinning wheel. Buttons should be durable, clearly labeled, and ergonomically spaced to mitigate RSI. Overall concept: rubber-cased, curved body; outside: core push-buttons; inside: LCD + spinning wheel; voice recognition included.",
    "Challenges\n- Tourism was among the first and hardest hit sectors as COVID-19 shut borders and non\u2011essential travel. International and interprovincial restrictions, a federal ban on cruise ships, mass\u2011gathering limits, and widespread festival/event cancellations erased demand.\n- Seasonal and rural operators faced acute cash\u2011flow crunches and uncertainty about reopening timelines and health protocols, with risk of permanent closures and layoffs among the sector\u2019s 1.8 million workers.\n- Many tourism small businesses struggled with fixed costs like rent, especially when landlords declined to participate in the federal rent\u2011relief program. Air travel disruption and refund disputes further strained the visitor economy.\n\nGovernment measures\n- Broad supports open to tourism firms: the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (extended to end of August), the $40,000 interest\u2011free CEBA loans, the Business Credit Availability Program, and the large\u2011employer LEEFF facility (relevant to carriers and big operators). Ottawa also worked with provinces on the CECRA commercial rent assistance delivered via CMHC.\n- Targeted tourism actions: reopening of Parks Canada sites beginning June 1 to restore local visitation; refocusing Destination Canada and destination marketing organizations from international promotion to \u201cvisit local\u201d campaigns; and regionally delivered aid through the Regional Development Agencies, including a dedicated tourism package (e.g., announced $70 million with allocations for Southern Ontario, Northern Ontario and Western Canada) and the broader near\u2011$1 billion Regional Relief and Recovery Fund to catch firms that couldn\u2019t access other programs (via ACOA, FedDev, FedNor, Western Diversification).\n- Cultural and events support intersecting with tourism: Canadian Heritage\u2019s $500 million emergency fund for arts, culture and sport organizations.\n- Ongoing engagement with industry (TIAC, chambers, Hospitality NL) and provinces on safe\u2011reopening guidance, while maintaining public\u2011health driven border decisions.",
    "Presentation highlights:\n- Technical: The remote\u2019s core was described as a battery-powered IC that senses a keypress or voice command, encodes it (Morse-like), drives a transistor amplifier, and emits via an IR LED to the TV. Key parts: integrated circuit, diode/transistor or resonator, resistors, capacitors, battery.\n- UI/Marketing: Research showed remotes are ugly, over-buttoned, and hard to learn; users would pay for sleeker, simpler devices. Team explored voice vs. buttons, slide/scroll inputs, and fashion-led styling with interchangeable covers.\n\nDiscussion:\n- Voice recognition was judged the signature innovation but immature/pricey. The team debated custom vs. off\u2011the\u2011shelf chips; custom would ease voice integration but risk time/cost. They also considered solar assist, \u201cfind\u2011me\u201d (clap/whistle), and minimizing power (e.g., no backlighting).\n- Function set was narrowed to TV\u2011only, with few physical controls and an on\u2011screen menu for seldom\u2011used settings (brightness/contrast/tuning). Fashion and brand visibility (Real Reaction logo) were prioritized via interchangeable rubberized covers.\n\nDecisions:\n- Energy source: a sealed, long\u2011life battery (target 5\u201310 years), no button backlighting, and wide IR emission.\n- Components: IR transmission; off\u2011the\u2011shelf controller to meet time/cost, paired with a dedicated voice sensor module (voice kept as fundamental feature).\n- Functional design: minimal manual controls plus voice. Physical inputs: large Power, Channel Up/Down buttons, and a side volume slider that also serves for menu navigation/selection via the TV\u2019s OSD. No teletext; TV\u2011only.\n\nPrototype:\n- Ergonomic, mouse/hairbrush\u2011like form that fits the hand; left-side volume slider, right-side channel buttons, prominent Power, broad IR window on top, and microphone placement suited for speaking. Lightweight plastic body with stretch\u2011on, interchangeable rubber covers (fashion themes), prominent RR logo, and a base that can be widened so it stands upright.",
    "Decision on DARPA:\n- The team committed to arriving at the mid\u2011July DARPA meeting in \u201cproduction mode\u201d: a stable transcription pipeline with a continuous data stream, known performance, and a subset of meetings ready for release. They will finalize the participant-approval process so they can say \u201ca subset is available now,\u201d and prepare two demos: (1) the transcriber interface and (2) a separate mock-up question answering/retrieval demo with pre-stored responses. To accelerate throughput, they will generate beep/chunk files from automatic segmentation, sample-check quality, and send them to IBM (fixing any issues on return), rather than hand-editing everything up front.\n\nPaper contents:\n- Section 1: Quantifies overlapped speech across four corpora using \u201cspurts\u201d (continuous speech segments with no pause >500 ms): Meeting Recorder meetings, Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. It compares overlap by words and by spurts, with and without backchannels.\n- Section 2: Measures how overlap affects ASR. By scoring only certified foreground-speech regions (via forced alignment), most extra error from overlaps (largely insertions due to background talk) nearly disappears, approaching the non-overlap error rate.\n- Section 3: Analyzes \u201cinterrupts\u201d: where second speakers begin relative to the foreground speaker\u2019s sentence. Using punctuation-derived sentence boundaries and lexical tags (discourse markers, backchannels, filled pauses, disfluencies), interruptions cluster after pauses, discourse markers, backchannels, and filled pauses.\n\nKey statistics reported:\n- Meeting Recorder overlapped words \u224817\u201318%; Robustness \u2248 half that (~9\u201310%).\n- Switchboard and CallHome show similar overlap levels to each other; removing backchannels reduces Switchboard overlap only modestly (e.g., ~14% \u2192 ~11%).\n- Overlap in two-party telephone speech is of the same order as multi-party face-to-face meetings.\n- Noted speaker distribution example: in Robustness meetings, one participant contributed ~56% of the words.",
    "- Agreement on training/testing the digits corpus:\n  - Run the exact same SRI recognizer on the standard TI\u2011digits test set to get comparable numbers, and also test our in\u2011room digits. \n  - Evaluate far\u2011field performance by decoding the PZM/other room mics while using near\u2011field segment times (from transcripts or forced alignment) so the test set matches prior HLT conditions. \n  - Try both with and without adaptation/VTL; beware little per\u2011speaker data (may fake speaker IDs or modify scripts). \n  - Optional: do small supervised channel adaptation to our room/far\u2011field acoustics, but not make that the main benchmark unless the far\u2011field problem is the target.\n\n- Current technique and limitations:\n  - The SRI tandem system (trained on large Switchboard data with adaptation) clearly outperforms the Aurora/HTK digits system; lapel mics perform surprisingly well.\n  - Our room\u2011recorded digits are harder than studio TI\u2011digits (residual noise/reverb, less cleaning).\n  - SRI front end is not plug\u2011and\u2011play; to try new features we must dump per\u2011segment feature files (P\u2011files), not stream a pipeline.\n  - Using a telephone\u2011bandwidth front end may help by removing out\u2011of\u2011band noise but limits use of wideband cues; VTL/adaptation can be unreliable with very short per\u2011speaker data.\n\n- Progress:\n  - Produced digits results; adaptation yields a clear gain; tiny extra gains from hypothesis adaptation and adding variance adaptation.\n  - Built scripts to manage speaker IDs; improved forced alignment by loosening pruning, enforcing continuity/proximity, and adding noise models; created CTM merge and \u201cspurt\u201d representations to analyze overlap and support far\u2011field tests.\n\n- Delays:\n  - Feature\u2011pluggability pending (awaiting Chuck); script changes needed for TI\u2011digits naming/speaker handling; potential memory/time limits for far\u2011field decoding.\n  - Deadline pressure (Eurospeech/Aurora); some on\u2011line normalization issues discovered and being corrected, requiring retraining.",
    "- Product name: The team favored \u201cTriple R\u201d over \u201cTriple RC.\u201d Marketing argued that adding \u201cRC\u201d weakened the \u201ctriple\u201d idea and muddied the branding; it reads like \u201ctriple remote control.\u201d The project manager added that \u201cthe first one looks like it\u2019s a triple remote control.\u201d \u201cTriple R\u201d kept the clean three\u2011R motif, looked better when printed, and avoided confusion.\n\n- Target age group and rationale: They concluded to target 15\u201335, especially young professionals (with 25\u201335 highlighted). Reasons: this group shows a high positive response to speech recognition, has disposable income, is tech\u2011savvy (accustomed to computers and mobiles), is more likely to buy a separate remote, and aligns with the company\u2019s \u201cfashion in electronics\u201d positioning.\n\n- Why marketing chose young people: Marketing emphasized that younger consumers are typically early adopters, more receptive to high\u2011tech features (notably voice recognition), and more willing to pay for attractive, trendy, and intuitive products. Targeting them also supports the brand\u2019s fashion/trend focus and increases the likelihood of market traction.\n\n- Channel selection discussion: There was a tension between simplicity and flexibility. The PM insisted that direct numeric channel selection is essential (\u201cno way anybody\u2019s gonna buy\u201d without it). Marketing stressed that users love to \u201czap,\u201d so quick cycling through many channels must be easy. The UI proposed minimizing buttons and relying on an LCD with navigation for advanced actions, plus \u201cfavorites\u201d to cycle a small set of commonly watched channels; numeric entry could be done via the LCD if physical number keys were limited. Ideas like previews/TV guide on the LCD were mentioned but flagged for feasibility/bandwidth concerns. Overall, the consensus leaned to basic on/off, volume, channel up/down, fast zapping, and some form of direct channel access, with less-used options tucked into menus.",
    "- Market research: A 100-person study found users dislike current remotes\u2019 look/feel and complexity; they use only about 10% of buttons. Priorities ranked: fancy look-and-feel (most important), then technological innovation, then ease of use (each step roughly half as important as the prior). Trend scouts in Paris/Milan flagged fruit/vegetable color themes and spongy materials. Younger users (15\u201335) are far more willing to pay for features like speech recognition than older users. The team must also reflect the corporate image and hit a build cost near \u20ac12.50.\n\n- Desired features: Focus on core TV controls (power, channel, volume) with big, user-friendly inputs; minimize or consolidate rarely used settings behind a single menu. Strong interest in a \u201cfind my remote\u201d function (radio-triggered beeper; voice \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d only if cost allows). Power options explored (AA/AAA, solar, kinetic, dynamo); they converged on conventional battery power for cost/robustness, with a possible dock/home to reduce loss.\n\n- Design opinions: Prefer a compact, ergonomic, slightly biomorphic form. A flip design with an LCD/touch or scroll interface on top and anti-RSI rubber buttons below was favored. An iPod-like scroll wheel and on-screen (TV) menus were considered to cut button clutter. Materials: plastic body with interchangeable rubber sleeves for grip, color/fashion updates; avoid literal fruit shapes (tacky), use vivid fruit/veg colors instead; titanium dropped for cost/practicality.\n\n- Necessity of \u201crevolution\u201d: The group agreed current remotes need a rethink, but cost and simplicity push toward an evolutionary \u201crevolution\u201d: drastically fewer buttons, clearer layouts, fashionable finishes, and smarter interaction (scroll/menu, finder) rather than expensive touchscreens or full speech recognition.",
    "- Quality assurance: Kirsty Williams said the new PCET Commission will run a coherent, effective and comprehensive quality regime. She is not set on creating a single QA body; instead, she wants stronger alignment between Estyn and QAA, full compatibility with ENQA standards, and better oversight of transnational education. The Commission will have a graduated toolkit\u2014from advice and guidance and enhanced monitoring through to sanctions\u2014so intervention is flexible, proportionate and preventive. She stressed no changes will jeopardise Wales\u2019s strong HE reputation.\n\n- HE risk: Asked whether more institutions may move into the \u201chigh\u2011risk\u201d category, HEFCW\u2019s Bethan Owen said the priority is to keep Welsh universities attractive to students (including from England and overseas) and to sustain investment in research capacity\u2014key to financial resilience. (HEFCW also noted risk is trending upwards, though not a crisis.)\n\n- Five principles for any wider school opening: (1) the safety and wellbeing of pupils and staff; (2) alignment with the wider Welsh Government public\u2011health response; (3) clear evidence\u2011based communication that builds confidence and allows time to plan; (4) careful prioritisation of which learners return first; and (5) operational feasibility (staffing, social distancing, transport, entrances). She emphasised no imminent change and any move depends on CMO/CSO advice.\n\n- Exams and qualifications: Summer GCSEs and A levels are cancelled. Schools will submit centre\u2011assessed grades using evidence such as classwork, coursework and mocks; these will be nationally moderated, with results days retained. Vocational qualifications will use tailored approaches; licence\u2011to\u2011practise components may need to be delayed. EMA continues and the Hwb programme, with device/connectivity support, underpins continuity of learning.\n\n- Responding to doubts about sufficiency: Williams rejected claims they were moving too fast or risking standards\u2014no relaxation is imminent, decisions will be evidence\u2011led and clearly communicated. On QA reform, she said sector fears are misplaced; reforms will protect standards while future\u2011proofing and improving synergy.",
    "The team\u2019s evaluation of the production process surfaced clear likes and dislikes.\n\nLikes:\n- Autonomy on key dimensions: They appreciated having real say over how technologically advanced and how fashionable the product could be, feeling they \u201cgot to choose\u201d many aspects despite constraints.\n- Teamwork and prototyping: Building the model together was enjoyable; they generally felt the collaboration worked well.\n- Tools and workflow: Laptops were \u201cextremely handy,\u201d the wireless setup and shared network made collaboration easier, and the digital pens were \u201cfun\u201d (even if their practical value wasn\u2019t fully clear). Overall, the tech environment supported fast sharing and iteration.\n- Momentum and market confidence: The process helped crystallize a concept they believed could sell\u2014combining a \u201ccool\u201d look with the features they wanted.\n\nDislikes:\n- Creativity constraints: They felt \u201cstifled\u201d by the company\u2019s initial restriction to making only a TV remote and by the TV-only scope, which limited broader innovation.\n- Process irritants: The survey/measurement aspects were called \u201cirritating,\u201d suggesting some overhead felt cumbersome.\n- Prototype/material limitations: The materials weren\u2019t what they wanted, some design elements (e.g., the cherry-themed cover) were hard to integrate, and important features like voice control couldn\u2019t be represented in the prototype, hindering evaluation.\n- Market fit concern for single-purpose: One teammate questioned the appeal of buying a remote \u201cjust for the TV,\u201d reflecting discomfort with the narrow use case.\n\nIn short, they liked the collaborative, tool-enabled workflow and autonomy over fashion/tech choices, but disliked the top-level constraint to a TV-only remote, the survey overhead, and prototype/material limitations that curbed creativity and fidelity.",
    "The group used a long-term mean subtraction in the re-synthesis pipeline (averaging over windows up to ~12 s and subtracting from the speech) to reduce stationary/channel effects\u2014functionally similar to channel normalization/CMS. In SRI experiments on Meeting Recorder digits, this helped far-mic PZM data (WER improved from ~6% to ~4.5%) but hurt near-mic (from ~1.2% to ~2.4%), whereas HTK had shown near-mic gains.\n\nTwo main explanations were proposed:\n- Redundancy with SRI adaptation: The SRI recognizer already performs channel adaptation (e.g., conversation- or utterance-side normalization, VTLN/MLLR). Mean subtraction may have provided a boost in HTK (which lacked such adaptation) but offered little or harmful benefit in SRI, possibly interacting poorly with its finer-grained acoustic models.\n- Re-synthesis artifacts: Subtracting a long-term average can introduce echo/pre-echo or reverberation-like effects, especially noticeable in low-energy regions. These artifacts may confuse the more detailed SRI models.\n\nA side observation was that PZM signals sounded \u201clouder\u201d after mean subtraction. The team noted that uniform gain alone shouldn\u2019t change performance if applied consistently to train/test, unless absolute energy features are involved; perceived loudness might instead reflect altered SNR or band-dependent amplification when the mean estimate is imperfect (subtracting mean log-spectrum approximates division).\n\nMitigations discussed:\n- VAD/high-pass-like treatment to zero or suppress very low-energy sections to remove echoes/pre-echoes.\n- DC offset checks/compensation.\n- Training on larger datasets to increase robustness.\n\nRelatedly, earlier \u201cmean phase subtraction\u201d was deemed mathematically suspect; a revised approach subtracts the phase of the mean complex FFT instead. Further comparisons between SRI and HTK on matched data were encouraged.",
    "- Mixed signals: For preparing IBM transcription, the group will start from Thilo\u2019s automatic per\u2011channel segmentation and generate \u201cbeeped\u201d mixed-audio (staggered mixed file) so transcribers can quickly tighten boundaries while listening to the mixed signal, then jump to individual channels only when overlaps or uncertainties appear. They\u2019ll sample-check the beep files and send whole meetings where possible. Forced alignment to separate cross-talk on lapel channels proved unreliable; clean per-channel boundaries plus mixed-audio review is the near\u2011term path.\n\n- VAD improvements: The new VAD uses noise\u2011compensated MFCCs with LDA and a small NN (9\u2011frame context, ~11k params). Current end\u2011to\u2011end VAD latency is ~220\u2013270 ms (\u224840 ms cleaning, delta/LDA, ~100 ms smoothing). To get under ~200 ms they\u2019ll: move delta before online normalization, shorten windows, and shave ~20+ ms elsewhere. A parallel, low\u2011latency energy\u2011ratio VAD (post/noise-pre clean) is being explored (also multiband variants), though robust thresholding across corpora is hard. They may feed the VAD flag to the tandem net or multiply posteriors by an independent silence probability.\n\n- VAD results: The updated system yields about 57.0% error\u2011rate reduction; a \u201ccheating\u201d clean\u2011speech VAD tops out near 62%. With the tandem stream, well\u2011matched and medium\u2011mismatch sets improve (~5% rel), but highly mismatched can degrade (~10\u201315% rel); overall weighted performance still improves.\n\n- Headphones (postdoc A): New headphones were purchased to address low gain with the originals; transcribers prefer the new set and expect fewer corrections. More units may be ordered.\n\n- Increasing space: They\u2019re archiving regeneratable Broadcast News P\u2011files to tape, relocating static corpora (Aurora/Spanish/SPINE) off the Meeting Recorder disk, and freeing space for ~5\u20136 more meetings; additional disks are on order.\n\n- Deadline: The evaluation is scheduled for November 15 (with internal emphasis on meeting any late latency requirements well before then).",
    "- Special schools and the \u201cnew purpose\u201d: Special schools remain central to the repurposed offer during COVID-19. They should, where possible, continue to support two priority groups: vulnerable learners (including many already self\u2011isolating due to health needs) and children of key workers. The presumption is to provide for these pupils in their usual special\u2011school setting rather than re\u2011sit\u00ading them elsewhere, both to protect continuity and because social\u2011distancing and specialist provision are harder to replicate in other venues. Even if only a minority can attend, those vulnerable pupils \u201cdeserve and need that support.\u201d Headteachers and staff are expected to plan and deliver age\u2011appropriate activities and welfare check\u2011ins, with local authorities coordinating and supplementing staffing (e.g., youth workers, support staff). RCT was cited as already exemplifying proactive contact and arrangements for their special\u2011school cohorts.\n\n- PDG for looked\u2011after children: role of schools vs regional consortia\n  \u2022 Regional consortia now hold and strategically deploy the PDG\u2011LAC via regional LAC coordinators. This shift from per\u2011pupil in\u2011school allocations was made because looked\u2011after children often move placements; previously, funding stayed with the school even when the child moved.\n  \u2022 Consortia can: (a) allocate resource directly to a school for an individual child, and/or (b) fund regional capacity\u2011building and universal approaches that disproportionately benefit LAC (e.g., attachment\u2011aware training, nurture provision, ACE\u2011informed practice). Some regions (e.g., EAS, ERW) frame this within wider \u201cvulnerable learners\u201d strategies.\n  \u2022 Schools\u2019 role is to implement the funded interventions, evidence impact, and be challenged/supported by consortia advisers on targeting and effectiveness.\n  \u2022 Welsh Government has tightened scrutiny (clear expectations issued; in\u2011year reviews) and commissioned an independent evaluation (ICF) of PDG\u2011LAC use and impact.\n\nIn short: special schools stay open (as feasible) to deliver the new purpose locally, while for PDG\u2011LAC, consortia plan and allocate strategically and schools deliver and evidence impact.",
    "User Interface, the Industrial Designer, and the Project Manager introduced a hand\u2011fitting, one\u2011handed prototype focused on simplicity and ergonomics. The Industrial Designer showed a form that molds to the palm, with the largest key as Power for easy discovery, channel up/down under the right thumb, and volume on the left (variously explored as buttons, a slider, or scroll). The IR emitter area was highlighted so it works whether pointed straight or held casually. A soft, spongy rubber outer \u201ccover\u201d stretches over a hard plastic core; buttons protrude through holes in the cover. They proposed lightweight plastics with rubberized, interchangeable covers (iPod\u2011style), company logo \u201cR_R_\u201d visible, and fruit/vegetable color themes (banana, watermelon, vanilla, etc.). The PM questioned how users would set it down; they agreed to widen/flatten the base so it can stand vertically and add another logo on the base. A Play\u2011Doh mockup conveyed the soft anti\u2011RSI feel, and an LED placement was noted.\n\nOn making it universal, they agreed the goal was a universal remote but discussed implications:\n- Processor/coding: a universal unit must emit different IR \u201ccodes\u201d per brand (\u201cMorse code\u201d), increasing processor complexity and influencing chip choice (simple vs regular/advanced; LCD or scroll wheels would push to higher chips).\n- Feature scope: keep basic, widely supported functions (power, channel, volume, mute, menu) prominent; advanced brand\u2011specific settings should be secondary or omitted.\n- Menu and multi\u2011digit entry: debated \u201cplus\u201d entry (1+2=12) vs tens/twenties keys and timeouts; noted legacy TVs differ, so they\u2019d research standards to ensure double\u2011digit and menu access work across brands.\n- Lost\u2011remote locator: placing the trigger on the TV breaks universality; they proposed a small external puck/sticker to ping the remote (beep/flash), TV\u2011brand\u2011agnostic.\n- Language/labels: interchangeable covers could localize button text without changing electronics.\n\nVoice control and LCD were considered but deprioritized as immature/too costly for a universal, simple design.",
    "- Appearance: He proposed a bright, eye\u2011catching look: a blue body with yellow and multi\u2011colored buttons, and a fluorescent\u2011green LED/menu button. He emphasized a rounded, biomorphic \u201csingle\u2011curve\u201d form that feels good in the hand, raised buttons, and an on/off key in a prominent, easy\u2011to\u2011find position. He liked color\u2011coding functional groups (e.g., orange for volume, distinct colors for channel controls). Initially he favored a soft, spongy rubber feel for \u201ccomfort,\u201d but later accepted moving to a hard plastic case to meet cost targets, suggesting special-shaped/colored buttons (fruit motifs like cherry/lemon) to maintain visual appeal.\n\n- Structure: He specified a strong plastic case and soft rubber buttons for better tactility, noting users touch buttons most. He stressed one\u2011handed ergonomics\u2014thumb reach to all keys for small and large hands. He supported a simple push\u2011button interface (cheaper and more reliable than scroll systems), with clear symbols for an international market, and considered a secondary/slide\u2011away panel for advanced functions. To stay within budget while keeping innovations (e.g., voice recognition, kinetic/battery options), he recommended switching the casing to plastic and limiting special materials, while retaining distinct forms for key buttons.\n\n- Customer preferences: He cited research and observations that buyers prioritize \u201cfancy\u201d look and feel, small size, and ease of use over complex functions. Younger users might value quick channel swapping and playful designs; many customers would pay for a good-looking remote and prefer soft/spongy textures if durability is maintained. He suggested large, clearly labeled or symbolic buttons, and even customizable/changeable covers to appeal to trendy users and children. In evaluation, he rated the prototype high on fanciness (~2/7) and kept ease-of-use a priority, acknowledging minor fashion trade-offs when shifting to plastic to hit cost.",
    "- $75 million for sexual exploitation and human trafficking: In response to questions about where this funding had gone, ministers pointed to the government\u2019s national strategy to combat human trafficking and said funds were flowing to frontline organizations. They stated that \u201chundreds of organizations\u201d had received support, that additional announcements were imminent, and cited distribution channels such as Feminists Deliver. They also said 700 women\u2019s centres and shelters had received funding, with more to follow. However, no detailed allocation breakdown or list of recipients was provided at committee; advocates (e.g., Battered Women\u2019s Support Services) reported many of roughly 500 related organizations had not yet received federal funds despite surging demand.\n\n- \u201cRisk appetite\u201d solution (universities): HEFCW described a managed approach to institutional risk. They monitor every university with five\u2011year forecasts, require scenario planning (including no\u2011growth cases), and must consent to material new borrowings. Estates strategies are overseen by governing bodies; HEFCW checks that the right questions are asked rather than second\u2011guessing decisions. Where plans look overly optimistic, HEFCW \u201chelps institutions think again.\u201d They are encouraging an independent review of governance in Wales and provide governors with benchmarking toolkits. HEFCW said they are not seeing imprudent risk appetite but acknowledged rising sector risk and that categories could shift if pressures persist.\n\n- Hon. Chrystia Freeland on systemic racism: Freeland affirmed that systemic racism exists in Canada, particularly affecting Indigenous and Black people, and said addressing it is complex, not \u201csimple.\u201d She stated the government opposes racial profiling, noted ongoing discussions between the Prime Minister/Public Safety Minister and the RCMP (including on use of force), and emphasized continued work with provinces and partners. She did not commit at committee to specific measures such as an explicit federal ban on carding, but reiterated that racial profiling is \u201cabsolutely inappropriate.\u201d",
    "Thilo\u2019s automatic segmenter is up and running well and is now central to the workflow. The team reports high recall from the segmenter; even with some over-segmentation (lower precision), that behavior is acceptable and potentially beneficial because it allows training/adaptation of background/noise models and handling of microphone transients during recognition. Based on this performance, they plan to move meeting recognition experiments from hand segmentations to Thilo\u2019s automatic segmentations.\n\nIntegration with transcription has also advanced. Pre-segmentations from Thilo are described as \u201cextremely helpful\u201d by transcribers. After problems with \u201ctoo many beeps\u201d in a prior run, the cueing scheme around segments was changed: instead of a single beep at the end, segments now begin with beep + spoken digit ID + beep. A new sample meeting has been processed with Thilo\u2019s segmentation and sent to the transcribers to verify that this revision fixes the earlier beep problem and to gauge turnaround.\n\nFor evaluation and improvement, they plan to derive speech/non-speech labels from completed transcripts to compare manual adjustments with the automatic boundaries. Note that a few recent meetings began without pre-segmentation while Thilo was briefly away, then were merged with automatic segments later, which complicates direct diffs but the original automatic outputs are retained for analysis.\n\nNo core algorithmic changes to the segmenter itself were reported; recent changes are primarily in pipeline integration and labeling/cueing around its outputs, with forthcoming work to exploit its posterior information and to adapt noise models for recognition using these automatic segments.",
    "- Price disagreement in the interactive evaluation: The Industrial Designer rated price as \u201cvery cheap\u201d because the concept relied on simple, old, robust components (push\u2011buttons, no exotic mechanics), which fit the \u201ckeep it simple\u201d reading of user needs and avoided costly innovation. The User Interface designer pushed the score higher (more expensive) because meeting the user requirement of \u201cfew buttons, menu-driven control\u201d and the hot trends (stylish/fruit-themed, possibly spongy casing) implied real software/menu development and interface programming effort\u2014costs not visible in the hardware bill of materials. In short: ID saw low BOM; UI counted UI/firmware development and finish options.\n\n- Disagreement on redesign after product evaluation: UI objected to the plan of launching with no redesign window after user testing, arguing that without iteration the product could flop on overlooked usability issues. The PM\u2019s stance was \u201cno more changes to the basic design\u201d until a second generation; UI insisted that user feedback must inform tweaks before launch.\n\n- Why yellow and red as basic colors: UI advocated company colors for brand recognition (earlier favoring bright yellow) and, in the cost exercise, limiting to standardized base colors (yellow/red) reduced \u201cspecial color\u201d charges while still aligning with the fruit/visibility trend. This balanced branding, trend fit, and the tight 12.5\u20ac unit cost target.\n\n- Marketing\u2019s disagreement with UI on shape: Marketing challenged UI\u2019s preferred shapes (abstract \u201cblob,\u201d single-curved body, later the ball/pineapple) on practical and market grounds\u2014top\u2011heavy balance, two\u2011hand use, and jump navigation concerns\u2014while favoring a clearer fruit silhouette (e.g., banana) that was on\u2011trend, easy to spot (less likely to be lost), and more retail\u2011distinctive.",
    "- Dafydd Evans: He views the Welsh bac\u2019s original employability aim as sound but says it currently prepares learners for work only inconsistently. Employers don\u2019t understand it\u2014he even questions the \u201cWelsh bac\u201d label and prefers \u201cSkills Challenge Certificate.\u201d He argues the qualification has \u201clost its way,\u201d trying to be both a rigorous academic credential and a vehicle for soft/employability skills. It works best when vocational staff contextualise it within courses, but overall impact is weakened by poor employer buy\u2011in, variable delivery, and competing priorities (e.g., GCSE resits at Levels 1\u20132). He calls for a review led by employers to refocus on employability and entrepreneurship and to structure industry engagement more effectively.\n\n- Kay Martin: She sees mixed effectiveness. Employers primarily want the main professional qualification plus literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. While the Welsh bac can help some A\u2011level learners (especially for university progression), it does not necessarily make many vocational learners\u2014e.g., in health and social care\u2014more employable. In her college, other initiatives (Career Ready mentoring/internships, WorldSkills) develop work\u2011readiness more directly and engage employers better. She highlights excessive paperwork and urges a refocus on experiential learning. Overall: useful for some, not the most effective or employer\u2011engaging route for many.\n\n- Nick Brazil: From regular employer board feedback, he finds the Welsh bac rarely demanded by industry. Employers back the original vision, but the qualification has become bureaucratic and outcomes\u2011driven, crowding out genuine skills development and overloading learners alongside core qualifications. He questions whether it currently delivers the employability skills employers need and suggests revisiting its design\u2014or developing those skills through alternative, non\u2011qualification routes\u2014so it better serves learners\u2019 progression into work.",
    "The team aligned on a TV\u2011only remote with a stripped\u2011down, intuitive feature set, then explored enhancements and the underlying working design. Core functions: power on/off (preferably a large, easy\u2011reach button), channel up/down, volume up/down, mute, and a numeric keypad (0\u20139, plus \u201center\u201d). Less\u2011used functions (audio/video settings, subtitles) would be accessed via a single Menu button or hidden under a flap/drawer to keep the surface uncluttered.\n\nAdditional ideas:\n- Channel navigation via a scroll wheel integrated with a favorites \u201czapping\u201d mode; the wheel is scroll\u2011only (not a press button). They noted a drop could spin the wheel; a possible \u201ctrigger + scroll\u201d combination may mitigate accidental changes.\n- A cradle/base station with two charging contacts and a \u201cfind my remote\u201d locator button; the remote would beep when lost. They debated rechargeable vs standard batteries and leaned to batteries to limit cost/complexity unless power needs grow (e.g., with voice).\n- Ruggedized, ergonomic body: white plastic chassis with rubberized red grip and rubber buttons for durability. Marketing prefers silver/black finishes to match TVs; corporate color/slogan to be integrated subtly (logo, accent LED).\n\nWorking design and components:\n- Standard IR transmission for speed to market; clear line\u2011of\u2011sight considerations if voice/mic were added.\n- Component stack: user input (buttons/scroll, optional mic), logic/smart chip, IR transmitter/receiver path, power source, and a visible activity LED for user feedback.\n- Costing/positioning: estimated build \u20ac15.4\u2013\u20ac15.8; target retail \u20ac35\u2013\u20ac50 for a mid to upper segment; lifetime normal\u2011use guarantee was suggested.\n- Voice recognition considered as optional/upgrade path (on/off selectable), valued for accessibility but flagged for cost, reliability, and maturity.\n\nThey also proposed grouping controls into \u201cdevice,\u201d \u201caudio,\u201d and \u201cother\u201d to guide layout and usability.",
    "- Market range and price: The PM repeatedly set the frame as an international consumer market (Europe, North America; also Australia/US mentioned). Target retail price is \u20ac25 with a maximum production cost of \u20ac12.50. He stressed this rules out \u201cultra\u2011high\u2011tech\u201d additions and pushes use of off\u2011the\u2011shelf parts (e.g., standard IR, lithium\u2011ion, rubber/plastic casing).\n\n- Target groups: He wanted broad accessibility (\u201cgrannies to kids\u201d), but pragmatically framed the core buyers as style\u2011conscious consumers under roughly 60 with some disposable income\u2014i.e., people replacing a remote, not business users.\n\n- On Marketing\u2019s proposed features: He welcomed differentiation only if it truly adds value and remains user\u2011friendly. Positive signals: a \u201cfind\u2011my\u2011remote\u201d locator (even a fun default sound), a bright, brand\u2011forward color (e.g., yellow) and rubberized, ergonomic styling. Cautions: fruit/veg theming is secondary to usability and brand; articulation/spongy skins need a firm internal frame; an LCD/menu is acceptable if it replaces clutter (numeric keypad) but requires a pricier chip; USB/PC setup is nice\u2011to\u2011have but may be cost\u2011prohibitive.\n\n- Multipurpose feasibility: He acknowledged a single remote for TV/DVD/VCR/cable is attractive and feasible via IR code libraries, with optional PC programming. However, he also pressed to prioritize core TV tasks (channel/volume) so multi\u2011device capability must not bloat cost or complexity.\n\n- Cost constraints and financial targets: \u20ac25 retail, \u20ac12.50 COGS, profit target \u20ac50M. He calculated ~4 million units needed and emphasized bulk procurement and standard components to hit margins.\n\n- Selling target necessity: He explicitly asked Marketing to quantify units required to meet the \u20ac50M goal to size the market and focus efforts.\n\n- Target market and next\u2011step plan (style discussion): Aim at broad consumers (esp. under ~60), stylish but simple. Keep brand elements (logo/slogan). Proceed to detailed design with UI and ID collaborating; maintain minimal physical layout, refine LCD/menu, and plan user evaluation later.",
    "User Interface consistently framed decisions around the stated cost and profit goals while protecting the visible value of the product. On constraints, they acknowledged the head\u2011office targets of a \u20ac25 retail price and ~\u20ac12.50 production cost, and the profit ambition (cited as ~\u20ac50M), noting the implied sales volume\u2014\u201cwe have to sell at least four million\u201d\u2014to make the business case work. They did briefly float the idea of raising the allowed cost/price (\u201cmake it costly\u201d), but ultimately accepted that the team had to work to the given specification and could only recommend a higher\u2011priced variant for later.\n\nRegarding trade\u2011offs, UI was clear that customer\u2011perceived benefits (shape, colors, customizable fronts, lighting) should not be sacrificed to hit cost: \u201cshape and colours, that\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t compromise.\u201d By contrast, they viewed the power source as low salience for buyers. On the kinetic battery specifically, UI said \u201cI think we could change the battery,\u201d and emphasized \u201ccustomers never said anything about the battery,\u201d signaling comfort with replacing the kinetic solution with standard cells if it helped meet budget.\n\nIn summary: UI accepted the tight cost/price targets and volume/profit aims, prioritized maintaining the distinctive look-and-feel (what customers notice), and was pragmatic about swapping out the kinetic battery for conventional batteries to control costs\u2014seeing that change as low risk to user appeal while preserving the features that drive purchase. They also recognized that premium features could be proposed for a higher-tier version rather than burden the base model\u2019s cost.",
    "They disagreed because they were optimizing for different priorities under tight constraints.\n\n- Target user and usability: The team aimed at seniors (60\u201380). The Industrial Designer argued kinetic energy conflicts with this user: \u201cyou basically shake your remote\u2026 I don't think that older people like to shake their remote before they use it.\u201d Marketing favored a docking station instead, positioning it as a marketable convenience that also houses the \u201cfind my remote\u201d feature. Thus, ID prioritized ease-of-use and minimal user effort; Marketing prioritized a compelling story and accessory-led value.\n\n- Simplicity vs feature creep: Marketing floated making the unit upgradable (e.g., via a card) to extend life and create a premium narrative (lifetime guarantee, exclusivity). The Industrial Designer pushed back, noting the current hardware/interface wouldn\u2019t support future functions without \u201cmore buttons\u201d and likely a different version. Upgradability threatened the product\u2019s deliberately simple, robust UI and could introduce confusion\u2014echoing concerns that added flexibility might \u201cmake it less usable.\u201d\n\n- Cost and manufacturability: The product had to be built for roughly \u20ac12.50\u2013\u20ac15.80. Kinetic systems and modular upgradability risked higher BOM, engineering complexity, and warranty exposure. Marketing acknowledged warranty implications; ID focused on feasibility and keeping to the minimalist, durable design and low cost.\n\nIn short, Marketing sought differentiators (docking station as a hero feature, upgradability for future value and positioning), while the Industrial Designer defended ergonomic simplicity, reliability, and cost control for the senior audience\u2014leading to divergence on kinetic energy and upgradability.",
    "- HEFCW\u2019s current powers: The 2015 Act gave HEFCW a clear set of intervention and sanction powers with the ability to escalate where necessary. HEFCW told the committee these can feel inflexible and \u201cthreatening,\u201d and cumbersome for swift action. The Minister disagreed they are frightening or unusable, but accepted the gap between informal \u201csoft\u201d influence and the strongest sanctions is too wide.\n\n- Intended changes: In the forthcoming PCET legislation, the Minister plans to equip the new Tertiary Education Commission with a more graduated toolkit. This would add flexible, preventative powers (e.g., advice and guidance, enhanced monitoring) before moving to formal, punitive steps, and ensure the regulator is structured and resourced to keep close, day\u2011to\u2011day relationships across a larger provider base. The Government is also exploring a regulatory condition on good governance.\n\n- Use in practice: HEFCW generally relies on informal measures given the small size of the sector and strong relationships. Even in recent high\u2011profile cases (Swansea; Trinity St David), HEFCW has not deployed formal intervention powers, instead supporting institutions. The Minister expects HEFCW to use its full remit if needed, but trusts its professional judgment.\n\n- Current situation and FE/HE closures: Universities and colleges are autonomous. They have moved rapidly to suspend in\u2011person teaching and deliver online, with limited on\u2011site provision for the most vulnerable learners. The Government is in regular dialogue with Universities Wales/UUK, colleges and independent training providers. Emergency coronavirus legislation will give Welsh Ministers temporary powers to close \u201cschools or other educational institutions,\u201d or issue \u201ccontinuity directions\u201d (including directing provision to remain open and redeploying staff) if required. At the time of discussion, decisions on FE and HE closures remained with institutions.",
    "The team will position the product as a fashionable, high\u2011quality universal remote priced at \u20ac25 with a target unit cost of \u20ac12.50 to preserve a strong per\u2011unit margin. Marketing will make it globally acceptable by using internationally recognizable icons, culturally neutral colors (standard black/silver to match TVs/DVDs), and simple, familiar layouts (kept number pad, clearly sized buttons, a prominent mode\u2011switch button for TV/DVD, and minimal clutter). They will study competitor remotes, adopt what works, and differentiate on sleek, trend\u2011forward design and better materials/feel while ensuring it\u2019s still immediately recognizable as a remote and easy to learn.\n\nTo drive adoption and volume, the remote will be universally compatible (NTSC/PAL, multiple brands) and specifically integrated with the company\u2019s own TVs and new DVD player, so one remote controls both\u2014supporting cross\u2011selling and potential bundling. They will add user\u2011valued, low\u2011cost features such as a \u201clocator/page\u201d function to find the remote, and consider light customization (colored indicators, dual\u2011function labeling) without sacrificing simplicity for non\u2011tech users.\n\nTo lift revenue beyond the base unit, the team will launch interchangeable \u201cfronts/faceplates\u201d distributed worldwide: a standard, mass\u2011appeal front and optional trendy skins (e.g., colors for kids\u2019 rooms), creating an accessory stream and helping the product feel fresh. Marketing\u2019s messaging will emphasize style (Apple\u2011like sleekness), quality, and universal convenience, while ensuring consistency with the company\u2019s product line.\n\nTogether, margin control (\u20ac12.50 COGS), global appeal and compatibility for high volume, ecosystem integration, and accessories upsell (faceplates) form the path to the \u20ac50M profit target.",
    "- Policies and measures: The Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales draft strategy takes an all\u2011age, whole\u2011system approach with strong focus on children. Officials are open to targets but wary of unrealistic ones; robust evaluation metrics are planned. Indicative investment discussed was \u00a38\u201310m per year, alongside reprioritising existing spend; Welsh sugar levy consequentials (~\u00a356m over two years) are noted, but Ministers prefer not to hypothecate. Governance will combine national oversight with local leadership via public services boards. Potential measures include legislation to restrict price promotions and energy drinks, tighter planning controls on hot food takeaways near schools (evidence\u2011led), and updating the 2013 Healthy Eating in Schools regulations to align with current SACN sugar guidance. Expansion of the Child Measurement Programme to a second measurement point is under consultation. A review of the clinical obesity pathway for children is under way, with stronger support for severely obese children. Early\u2011life actions (breastfeeding, Healthy Start) and tackling inequalities and food affordability are priorities.\n\n- Physical education: Increasing children\u2019s activity is central for health and wellbeing. Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales are coordinating school\u2011based programmes. Emphasis is on enjoyable, inclusive activity (addressing teenage drop\u2011off, especially among girls). Possible statutory PE guidance will be tested via consultation. Better school design and community access (changing rooms, facilities) should be guided by health impact assessments. Teacher training/CPD and school\u2011level leadership are key; accountability should sit above individual teachers.\n\n- Food provision for free\u2011school\u2011meal children during the pandemic: With schools repurposed as hubs, immediate priorities are childcare for key workers, safeguarding vulnerable learners, and continuing FSM. Local authorities and schools are implementing emergency arrangements from the first closure week, moving to resilient hub models, with the aim of seamless FSM provision through the normal Easter holiday. Emergency legislation may allow temporary flexibilities (e.g., food standards) to maintain provision.",
    "- Why the curved/ergonomic design:\nUser Interface advocated a biomorphic, curved form so the remote would conform to the hand, improve comfort, and place controls naturally. They stressed that the most critical curve was on the underside so the joystick could rest over the edge of the hand, with a rubberized grip through the middle for a \u201cspongy,\u201d comfortable feel. They also considered articulating the LCD for left- and right-handed use and possibly an ovoid joystick base to suit handedness. The double/single-curved casing and rubber keypad area were meant to enhance ergonomics and visual distinctiveness.\n\n- Reasons for agreement on key features:\n\u2022 Easy to use: They converged on minimal controls (two buttons + joystick) and moving navigation to an LCD-driven menu, reducing clutter and making common actions simpler, with the joystick placed in an ergonomic thumb position. They acknowledged technophobes might find the look unfamiliar but still treated the simplified interface as usability-positive. \n\u2022 Fashion: Real Reactions\u2019 strategy was to \u201cput the fashion in electronics\u201d via fruit/veg inspiration. The team leaned into a banana-themed, curved, yellow design (with discussion of lighting/transparent material), aligning with current fashion cues; this was ultimately rated very high.\n\u2022 Easy to find: Because the electronic locator was cut for cost, they agreed to use a bright, non-dingy color (notably yellow) so the remote stands out \u201cin a big pile of\u201d living-room clutter.\n\u2022 Robust: A rubber, \u201cspongy\u201d outer shell around a plastic substructure was seen as impact-absorbing and protective; they rated robustness very high.\n\n- How UI evaluated fashion:\nUI initially questioned how \u201cfruit and veggie\u201d the form truly was, but in the final scoring accepted and endorsed a top fashion rating, citing the banana-inspired curvature, yellow color, and alignment with the company\u2019s fashion brief."
