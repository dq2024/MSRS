    " <p> Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales.</p><p>The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do. We're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely accept that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. Can I just come back to the first thing you said: 'We can't say yet what we're going to do'? No. The alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase is not a straightforward process. However, we are working on simplifying the system, and we are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. The childcare offer is primarily aimed at working parents, with the goal of providing stable jobs and reasonable pay to support the development of children. While the take-up of the offer has been increasing each month, there are concerns that the current system may not be equitable, particularly for lower-income families who may face barriers in accessing childcare. The Welsh Government is committed to addressing these concerns and ensuring that the childcare offer is accessible to all families, regardless of their background or income level.</p>\nANSWER:  <p>The childcare offer is primarily aimed at working parents, with the goal of providing stable jobs and reasonable pay to support the development of children.

    " Special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement and have a role in relation to schools with PDG for looked-after children compared to the regional consortia in this field. The special schools have already been hit by the challenge, and a significant proportion of their children have not been coming to school due to their conditions. However, the principle used is that even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. \n\nHowever, the regional consortia have appointed regional LAC coordinators, which has been helpful in addressing the needs of looked-after children. The consortia are also using the grant to fund individual bursaries to support the work and school-to-school work to share best practice.\n\nThere is a lack of knowledge about how effective the PDG is with looked-after and adopted children. The grant is supposed to be spent on looked-after children, but it is not always targeted effectively. The regional consortia have shifted the focus from spending the grant on individual children to a more regional approach, aiming to address the needs of vulnerable learners in general. This includes children who may be transitioning between schools, and the consortia are using the grant to fund programs aimed at supporting these children.\n\nThe PDG for looked-after children is not well-targeted, and there is a lack of awareness among schools about the grant's existence and purpose. The regional consortia are using the grant to fund training for schools on emotional behavior and attachment, and there are individual bursaries to support the work. However, there is a need for more effective targeting of the grant to support looked-after children.\n\nThe attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those who aren't has not closed significantly at any stage of learning. The PDG has had some impact, but it is difficult to determine the exact impact. The grant has been used to improve attendance, literacy, and numeracy, but it is unclear how much of an impact it has had on closing the attainment gap.\n\nOverall, the PDG has had some positive effects, but there is room for improvement in targeting the grant more effectively to support looked-after children and adopted children. The regional consortia's shift in focus from individual children to a more regional approach has helped to address the needs of vulnerable learners, but more work is needed to ensure that the grant is targeted effectively.",
