    "The domains in the mental spaces refer to distinct conceptual areas or contexts that are activated during discourse. These domains can include temporal, spatial, hypothetical, or conditional scenarios, such as past events, future possibilities, or hypothetical situations (e.g., \"in France, Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon\"). The mental spaces framework allows for the representation of these different contexts and their relationships, enabling the understanding of complex linguistic phenomena like counterfactuals or hypothetical reasoning.\n\nThe middle layer in this framework functions as a bridge between observed linguistic features (e.g., verb choice, discourse cues) and the higher-level conceptual interpretations (e.g., whether someone is a tourist or running an errand). This layer introduces hidden variables, such as \"being on a tour,\" \"running an errand,\" or \"being in a hurry,\" which probabilistically depend on the observed features. For example, if someone mentions \"admission fees,\" the middle layer might infer that the person is likely interested in entering a location rather than just viewing it from the outside. The middle layer thus helps to abstract and generalize from specific linguistic cues to broader conceptual categories, facilitating more nuanced interpretations of discourse.",
    "The professor expressed a preference for using compact, binary formats for storing data, particularly for frame-level information, as text-based formats would be too verbose and inefficient for large datasets.
