    "The group felt that changes were needed in data collection. One suggestion was to use CrossPads, but Professor A questioned their usefulness. Professor D suggested getting transcriptions from IBM even if they were flawed. Professor A thought summaries might help generate queries. Professor D agreed, suggesting word frequency counts. Postdoc H suggested recording summaries instead of writing them. Professor A proposed using notes from a designated note-taker.\n\nRegarding the use of English, Postdoc H raised a question about protocol, specifically when using jargon like \"Jimlet\" that listeners might not understand. Professor D responded that jargon is common in specialized groups and suggested having people write summaries or asking them how they would query things. The professor did not believe that English usage was an issue but comprehension of the jargon was.",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models, focusing on user requirements and market trends. They emphasized the need for a fancy, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, fashionable, and robust remote control. They discussed a questionnaire with a seven-point scale to evaluate the design based on these criteria.\n\nThe discussion included specific design elements like the shape, color, and material (rubber) to make it robust and appealing, considering the preferences of different target groups. They also considered features like a microphone and LCD screen to enhance usability.\n\nRegarding the user budget, they aimed to keep the cost below their threshold to sell it at twenty-five Euros and make a profit. They explored cost-saving measures such as removing the scroll wheel and speech recognition to meet the budget. The group also discussed the target demographic, considering factors like age and disposable income, but ultimately decided to prioritize simplicity and fashion in the design.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not contain extensive discussions on the uncertainty of the Canadian economy and the government's actions during the special period, nor do they include the opinions of Cathy McLeod, Mona Fortier, and Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie on these matters. The transcripts primarily focus on the COVID-19 pandemic response, including financial aid programs, firearms legislation, and concerns about seniors and vulnerable populations. There is some discussion about the impact of the pandemic on various sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, but not in-depth analysis of the broader economic uncertainty. There is also discussion of the government's use of tax havens and the need for more transparency.\n",
    "The industrial designer did not mention studying the characteristics of a tiger for the product design. The industrial manager did mention drawing a cat and the favorite characteristic of the cat was the whiskers because they were the easiest to draw.\n",
    "The team discussed the integration of speech recognition into the new remote user interface. The interface designer expressed it was one of her favorite personal features and wanted it integrated into the new remote. The marketing expert agreed, believing a speech recognizer would be a big selling point. The team discussed adding buttons for the recording of speech, possibly by eliminating one of the mute buttons and consolidating some of the usage to create space. The project manager stated that they needed to leave space money-wise for the voice recognizer.\n",
    "The presentations covered various aspects of remote control design and market trends. The components design presentation explored materials for the case (plastic, wood, latex, titanium, rubber), button types (pushbuttons, scroll wheels, LCD screens), circuit board complexity (simple, regular, advanced), and battery options (AA, kinetic, solar). \n\nThe market findings highlighted a shift towards fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and ease of use as key factors. Fashion trends indicated a preference for fruit/vegetable themes and spongy materials.\n\nThe conceptual specifications of user interface components focused on essential functions (favorite channels, volume, power) and advanced features accessible through a menu system (LCD screen or on-screen display). The presentations addressed considerations for button design, menu navigation, and display technology.\n\nThe presentations covered properties and materials, trend watching, interface contents, remote components, and market trends.\n",
    "The early implementer areas have gone well, but the Welsh government is learning lessons as they go. One of the biggest lessons learned is the administrative burden placed on local authorities to administer the scheme. The current approach asks parents to prove eligibility by bringing in wage slips and birth certificates. This is especially difficult for parents with complex backgrounds.\n\nDemand for the services is not spread evenly across the early adopter areas due to economic and cultural issues. In some south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families, with grandparents, aunts, and uncles providing free, unregistered childcare. The childcare offer is not only to provide childcare but also ties into the foundation years offer, with an element of education linked to the childcare offer.",
    "The Project Manager expressed a desire to incorporate speech recognition and LCD into the product. However, due to cost constraints and market research, the Project Manager suggested scrapping speech recognition to stay within budget (12.5 Euros). They noted that only 60% of people favored speech recognition, while 90% favored an LCD display.\n\nRegarding technology, the Project Manager mentioned the LCD display was expensive. On button design, they emphasized the need for push buttons, and the industrial designer stated the buttons would be made of rubber. The Project Manager was in favor of keeping the rubber material for durability and the \"squishy feeling\" that marketing research indicated people liked.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of recording conventions and the potential incorporation of video recordings. Initially, the team discussed the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. The research department reported that the voice control could talk back if asked a question, which the team considered a good idea to confirm any action taken.\n\nThe team also considered whether to incorporate an LCD display. While it could be used to show channel listings as one scrolls through stations, it was ultimately determined that the remote control did not need to talk back to the user. The team considered voice activation, but decided it was too hard to implement. They decided to incorporate voice recognition only for the remote finder feature.",
    "The discussion about project finance was brief, with the project manager stating, \"Well the finance we'll do later, so firstly I'll show you the notes.\" The aim is to sell the remote internationally for twenty-five Euros, keeping costs at twelve and a half Euros.\n\nThe \"drawing board\" refers to a SMARTboard used for collaborative drawing during meetings. The project manager demonstrated its basic functions: adding pages, navigating between pages, saving, and using a pen to draw and erase. Participants were asked to draw their favorite animal to get acquainted with the board and each other. The industrial designer found the SMARTboard to be a complete disaster and useless, but the project manager liked it.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer focused on the practical aspects of the remote control's design, such as the energy source (batteries), signal transmission (infrared), and the placement of buttons. They considered alternative technologies like Bluetooth and solar charging but were mindful of cost implications. They seemed open to ideas but also pragmatic about keeping the design simple and focused.\n\nThe Project Manager emphasized the importance of adhering to the company's corporate image, particularly the use of yellow and blue colors. They also stressed the need for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, favoring proven technologies over potentially complex or expensive alternatives. The Project Manager acted as a facilitator, gathering information from the team and ensuring the project stayed on track.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager drew the conclusion that the team was generally aligned on the core features of the remote control. They also identified potential areas for further exploration, such as ergonomic improvements and the inclusion of a locking function. The Project Manager noted the importance of balancing user needs with manufacturing costs and the company's branding guidelines.\n",
    "The team's decision-making process for the remote's base involved several considerations. Initially, the base was planned to be gunmetal gray plastic with a curvature for comfortable handling. The curvature was intended to be a single concavity.\n\nThe team evaluated the remote's fashionability using a seven-point scale, considering criteria like \"feel good\" and trendiness. The industrial designer expressed concerns about incorporating a \"cherry fruit\" cover. They also debated the inclusion of features like voice recognition and whether it should cover more than just TV functions. The team considered a spongy material, drawing inspiration from mobile phone covers, and explored the possibility of fruit-themed, removable covers.\n\nThe team discussed the pros and cons of existing remotes, noting issues like excessive buttons and inconsistent user interfaces. They referenced voice-recognition remotes, iPods for their simplicity, and even children's remotes with parental controls. The team explored the possibility of a two-part remote, with a simpler handheld component and a more complex control base. They also considered the energy source, ultimately settling on batteries over options like hand dynamo or solar cells due to practicality and user expectations.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of designing an environmentally-friendly remote control. They considered using spongy materials, which are currently trending, for the remote's exterior or as removable covers, potentially with fruit and vegetable patterns. They also discussed titanium and hard plastic as potential materials, with a possible combination of a plastic front and titanium back.\n\nThe group explored the idea of an LCD screen and its placement on the remote, along with the design and layout of buttons for easy use. They considered a questionnaire to gather user preferences. The discussion also touched on the \"material and function\" issue, balancing aesthetics with functionality. They also spoke of an LSD screen. Color choices were explored, with bright colors and primary colors being considered, as well as the possibility of a gun-metal grey base.",
    "The Project Manager introduced the remote control prototype, emphasizing user needs, technical aspects, and working design. The User Interface designer highlighted user-friendliness and fashion, focusing on keeping buttons to a minimum and exploring design elements like color and shape. The Industrial Designer outlined the mechanical functions, including channel/volume input and a location function.\n\nThe group debated multi-functional (universal) versus single-functional (television only) remotes, considering the target demographic and project requirements. The decision was made to focus primarily on television functions, with potential for D_V_D_ compatibility pending clarification of project requirements. The technological aspect received lower grades due to concerns about speech recognition's complexity, cost, and the potential need for additional hardware.\n\nThe locator was presented as a functional requirement to address the common issue of losing the remote. The Industrial Designer proposed a separate base unit with a button that would trigger a beep on the remote, aiding in its location. This feature was deemed desirable for the target demographic of teenagers and young professionals.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C agreed that Jose would look into the possibility of indexing or speech understanding. PhD C mentioned that the team should standardize on the components they were not changing, especially with everyone trying different noise suppression techniques. PhD C would not investigate other differences. The discussion with Jose centered on his work studying parameters to detect overlapping zones in recorded speech. He had transcribed the first session and found a thousand acoustic events besides the overlapping zones.\n\nThe problems and difficulties faced were primarily due to overlapping speech and other acoustic events, making it challenging to accurately transcribe and analyze the data. The amount of time it took to transcribe and label events was also a difficulty.\n",
    "The discussion on latency centered around the total latency of the Aurora system, which was at 330 milliseconds. Professor B expressed concern because the target was 250 milliseconds, and some proposals aimed for as low as 30-40 milliseconds. The professor noted that the system was trading latency for performance, while others prioritized low latency, potentially by sacrificing performance or dealing with noise explicitly.\n\nThe professor had an issue with it because of the strict latency requirements. While acknowledging that humans might not perceive the difference between a quarter of a second and shorter latencies, the professor recognized the need to adhere to the imposed limitations. The main source of latency included low frequency band filter delay of 64ms, high frequency band filter delay of 11ms compared to IIR filter of 200ms, 85 milliseconds for online normalization and 80ms for the neural net and PCA.",
    "The User Interface detailed design of the prototype introduced several key features and advantages. The scroll wheel was implemented for channel selection and volume control, with the addition of a \"turbo button\" for quickly skipping through channels. A base station was designed for battery charging and included a \"remote call\" feature to help locate the remote when lost. An LCD screen was included to display options, as well as a speech recognition feature. These features were implemented with a focus on ergonomics, ease of use, and marketability. The design also considered the durability of the remote, using rubber materials to protect it from damage. However, concerns about the scroll wheel's potential for accidental rotation and the reach of the power button were noted. The marketing team expressed satisfaction with the design, highlighting the marketable features and the potential for future product expansions.\n",
    "The prototype model presentation covered three different versions: the rhombus, the potato, and the Martian. The team leaned toward the potato shape for its ergonomic design, with red buttons for changing channels and a middle button for the on-screen menu. The team evaluated the prototype using a seven-point scale, considering factors like uniqueness, functionality, fancy design, ease of use, spongy quality, integration of fruits and vegetables, design matching appropriate behavior, RSI prevention, ease of learning, simplicity, and fashion.\n\nTwo versions of the potato prototype were planned, one with fruity colors and another more conservative version, both incorporating the corporate logo. The team discussed the possibility of a corporate version with yellow and black colors and the R_R_ logo. The team determined that the cost was within budget, but the team also discussed the need for more market research and user testing.",
    "The group discussed several aspects of the new product's design while considering budget constraints and functionalities.\n\n**Touch Screen:** The top screen would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen with all available remote functions. The discussions revolved around its functionalities for advanced options, potentially including sound and image adjustments like bass and treble.\n\n**Flip Screens:** The product would have a flip-top design, and the team explored the possibility of kinetic batteries attached to the flipping mechanism for charging. The placement of the microphone for voice recognition was debated, with considerations for usability whether the flip is open or closed.\n\n**Battery Issues:** There was a discussion about kinetic batteries versus standard batteries, with concerns about cost and customer preferences. Ultimately, to meet budget specifications, the team considered moving away from the kinetic battery, since customers did not specifically request it.\n\n**Flip Top Design:** The group discussed the overall aesthetics, aiming for a fancy look and feel incorporating current fashion trends. There were talks of customisable features and a spongy texture for the exterior. The design should also minimise RSI.\n",
    "The Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru, including the importance of strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system, comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school, teacher quality, and collaborative activity. The Government is applying these lessons to the wider school improvement program by embedding best practices and interventions that drove school improvement into the new support provided by the regional consortia. Additionally, some of the best people employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now employed by the regional consortia.\n\nThe program is progressing well, with examples of schools making sustained improvements, and there is minimal risk that they will slip back to where they were. However, there is a challenge for schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and the Government is using its school improvement system to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support they need to make a difference.",
    "According to Dr. David Blaney, Brexit has had an impact on Wales' higher education system, specifically in the form of decreased applications from EU students. UCAS data shows an 8% decrease in EU-domiciled applicants to Welsh institutions, in contrast to a 2% increase for English institutions.\n\nDr. Blaney suggests two primary reasons for this decline: the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to find the full fee amount, and the state of repair of campuses. The media in the UK is Anglocentric and investment in facilities and infrastructure in Wales has been lower than in England, making Welsh universities less attractive to prospective students.\n\nDr. Blaney believes that prospective students should choose to study in Wales because the universities offer a UK-quality system and degree but in a safer and more supportive environment. He also mentions the \"Study in Wales\" program, which aims to promote Wales as a good place to study.\n",
    "The domains in the mental spaces are user, situation, discourse, and ontology. The middle layer functions as an intermediate level where features extracted from the communication are processed. The hidden variables in this layer determine concepts like whether someone is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry. These variables probabilistically depend on the extracted features. The middle layer helps to keep things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept. It also allows for the combination of information from different domains, such as the user model, ontology, and discourse, to influence decisions.\n",
    "Professor A's thoughts on the back-end and storing data appear to revolve around practicality and resourcefulness. They emphasize using existing resources like collected meeting data and web pages rather than expending significant effort on new data collection. They suggest a minimal preservation of data, such as taking pictures of boards and noting the position of people, as well as summarizing notes. Professor A. seems primarily concerned with obtaining text data for their immediate needs but recognizes the potential value of other data types, like video. They are open to using CrossPads if they can be easily integrated, with a focus on gathering information useful for UI design. Professor A. also advocates for leveraging existing note-taking practices in meetings, using those notes as summaries and a means of capturing key information. Overall, their approach is pragmatic, focusing on what can be reasonably achieved with available resources and minimizing extra burden on participants.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several critical issues. Regarding the seniors care crisis, the focus was on the disproportionate death toll in long-term care facilities and the need for systemic changes. The deployment of the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in these facilities was acknowledged as a temporary measure, with emphasis on the urgency of finding long-term solutions.\n\nThe relationship between racism and long-term care was not explicitly discussed, but the broader issue of systemic racism was addressed, including the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racialized communities. There were calls for race-based data collection to inform better policy decisions.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were discussed, including calls for stronger measures to protect severance pay, termination pay, pensions, and benefits in cases of corporate bankruptcy.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay's perspective on the public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families emphasized openness to input and a commitment to providing appropriate compensation, while acknowledging the impossibility of fully compensating veterans for their sacrifices.\n\nThe Minister of Seniors did not make a statement on pandemic assistance for seniors in the provided text, but there was discussion regarding top-ups to the OAS and GIS.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer had disagreements on the remote control design due to differing priorities and perspectives. The Industrial Designer focused on innovative shapes, user-friendliness, ergonomics, and technical aspects like scroll wheels and button placement. Marketing emphasized trendy aesthetics, market research findings (younger vs. older demographics), and features like changeable fronts and \"eye candy\" to attract customers. The Project Manager was concerned with budget constraints, technical feasibility (LCD screens, speech recognition), and balancing simplicity with functionality, sometimes leading to conflicting user requirements. These differing viewpoints resulted in debates over button layout, inclusion of an LCD screen, rechargeable batteries, and the overall target demographic (younger vs. older users).\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation based on user requirements and market trends discussed in previous meetings. The evaluation criteria included:\n\n*   **Fancy look and feel:** Assessed the product's aesthetic appeal.\n*   **Technologically Innovative:** Evaluated the product's advancements in technology.\n*   **Easy to use:** Determined how user-friendly the product was.\n*   **Fashionable:** Rated the product's trendiness and style.\n*   **Easy to find in a room:** Judged how easily the product could be located.\n*   **Robust:** Assessed the product's durability and sturdiness.\n\nA seven-point scale was used for each criterion, with seven being the highest score. Marketing did not want to vote themselves, but the team pressed them to join in. The team collaborated to assign a score for each criterion based on their perception of the prototype.",
    "The current status of transcription is that Jane is moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side and has hired some new transcribers. They've run out of EDUs because a certain number of them are awaiting to go to IBM. The IBM tape has gone out to transcribers, and the transcription should be back next week. Regarding recordings, they have about thirty-five hours of recordings as of a week and a half ago, including digits.\n\nXML is being used as the general format for everything. However, the speaker designations are not being recorded consistently in the Key files and should be recorded in Edit-key. There is also discussion of intermediate categories related to the SPG schema, specifically concerning the use of XML tools for data extraction and reformatting. There's a desire to meet and discuss transcription formats in XML because the current format doesn't mark start and end times, making it difficult to use with other tools.",
    "The Deputy Minister addressed her amendments concerning the duty to promote public awareness by emphasizing the government's commitment to a high-intensity, six-year awareness campaign following Royal Assent, responding to the committee's Stage 1 report recommendations. She argued against specifying particular groups or topics on the Bill's face, stating that it could risk overemphasizing certain groups while excluding others.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the legislation's effect, the Deputy Minister highlighted that the post-implementation review would be a continuous program, not a single event, and that the public's attitude would be tracked regularly. She did agree to consult with the committee on the contents of an interim report at Stage 3.\n\nOn regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister initially proposed removing the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement. She did not think it was necessary to have wider powers, but assured the committee that they would keep that in review coming up to Stage 3 and was happy to discuss it before Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted long-term trends of educational reform in Wales. Meilyr Rowlands stated that while significant educational reform has inherent risks, standards have not slipped due to the ongoing co-construction process involving teachers and leaders. However, concerns were raised about the varying preparedness between primary and secondary schools, with secondary schools facing greater challenges.\n\nPhilip Blaker, representing Qualifications Wales, emphasized the organization's role in regulating awarding bodies, focusing on qualification design and assessment delivery. He explained that Qualifications Wales aims to ensure fair grading through comparable outcomes, particularly during periods of change. Blaker also highlighted the need to review timelines for reforms to allow greater system readiness, and the necessity to consider different models for textbook provision.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of exams, Blaker suggested that the divergence in GCSEs and A-levels between England and Wales provides an opportunity to establish a timeline that reduces pressures on the system. Gareth Pierce also advised that 18 months to two years are needed from completing a specification to working with teachers and publishers to get resources available. Blaker stated that a \"go/no-go\" decision would need to be made in 2023.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted several challenges of implementing good practice across Wales and the implications for childcare services.\n\nA key challenge is the inconsistent demand for childcare services across different regions due to economic and cultural factors, such as traditions of family-based childcare in some areas. This uneven demand complicates resource allocation and service planning. The administrative burden on local authorities to administer the childcare offer, including verifying eligibility and managing changing work patterns, was also identified as a significant hurdle.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged the diversity within the childcare sector, from small home-based providers to large organizations, and the regional variations in the scale and type of childcare available. Concerns were raised about the fragility of the childcare sector in Wales and the need for workforce development and capital investment to ensure sufficient capacity to meet the anticipated demand. The potential for a two-tiered system, where wealthier parents can afford additional services beyond the basic childcare offer, was also discussed. These challenges have implications for ensuring equitable access to quality childcare services across all parts of Wales.\n",
    "The discussion centered on the availability and design of actual components for the remote control.\n\n**Case Material:** The case will be made of hard plastic with soft rubber for grip and protection from falls. A double-curved case is desired for a trendy look, and when using a double-curved case, the buttons must be rubber. Titanium is a trendy material, but is not compatible with double-curved cases.\n\n**Interface Design:** Buttons are favored over a scroll wheel to keep costs down, and push buttons require a simple chip. The team agreed on a simple design with large skip and volume buttons for ease of use. An on-screen menu will handle advanced functions, accessed via a menu button on the remote. Voice recognition is also being considered.",
    "Professor F's thoughts on the final model are not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, the professor seems to agree with the general direction of improving the system, especially by incorporating a voice activity detector (VAD) into the baseline.\n\nThe discussion on time series involved using longer analysis frames for reverberation removal, then re-synthesizing audio for feature calculation, but this was not fully explored.\n\nRegarding \"zero,\" the discussion centered on addressing the issue of the recognizer catching zeros, especially at the beginning of utterances. The professor mentioned an option in RASTA to add a random bit to avoid zeros, but realized it was equivalent to adding flat spectrum noise.\n",
    "The group discussed the introduction of a new remote control with various concepts. They considered a fancy controller with speech and gesture recognition, but raised concerns about reliability, potential injuries from repetitive gestures, and international language adaptation. While voice recognition was deemed convenient in some scenarios, the project manager worried about family members interfering with each other.\n\nThe group also talked about the industrial design concept including materials, power, and user interface. It was decided that the remote control would have a solar battery, lighted buttons and low-level chips.\n\nUltimately, the group leaned towards a design that was Google-like, easy to use, sophisticated, and fancy. They decided on a banana-shaped remote control with a spongy cover that could be peeled back to reveal buttons, a small LCD screen, and a solar cell. The group also decided to include speech recognition.\n",
    "The group's discussion did not include an elaboration on the evaluations of increasing suicide crimes during COVID-19 or long-term special care for pregnant women. However, Vaughan Gething did state that the government commissioned a review to understand the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. He also stated that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. Additionally, he stated that the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to for perinatal mental health is a concern.",
    "The transcripts do not contain details about the implementation work or the risk of losing focus.\n\nHowever, the management team wanted the remote to be simple and to get it to market quickly, which would be challenging based on the original meeting.\n\nThere was no discussion regarding networking within the PRU. The transcript contains a discussion regarding transition arrangements between children and adult services and there was a concern that the referral process between the two was not a smooth one.\n",
    "The group seemed aligned on the idea that infra-red was the best technology for the remote. One member stated that infra-red was the best way to project information to the receiver because it does not need a sight line. The group also determined that the target market should be between 15 and 35 years old, as this demographic would be more inclined to pay for technological advancements like voice recognition. It was also mentioned that this demographic has a fair amount of disposable income to spend on technology. The price point was set at 25 Euro.",
    "The group holds a somewhat negative view on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure, but believes that in the absence of anything better, it is the best measure currently available. There is concern about the blurring of eligibility and whether the money is being targeted appropriately.\n\nThe group acknowledges improvements in attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals due to PDG, but recognizes that a gap remains between these children and their non-free school meal counterparts. Some examples of good practice include schools proactively using PDG to improve attendance, such as sending teaching assistants out of school in the morning to create walking buses. The group is looking at what more can be done to support this agenda and close the attainment gap.\n",
    "Professor A expressed interest in exploring tandem systems with the SRI system, suggesting feeding tandem outputs into the SRI system. He believes the amount of training data significantly impacts speech recognition performance, referencing commercial systems that utilize vast amounts of data. While acknowledging that features are designed to be robust to noise and channel variations, he suspects the amount of training data is the primary factor contributing to the difference in performance between TI-digits and Meeting Recorder digits. He notes that TI-digits are recorded in a very clean, studio-like environment, whereas the Meeting Recorder digits are more realistic.",
    "The professor believes that visual abilities are so good at picking out patterns from noise that it doesn't seem that bad at first glance because there are many features that are still preserved. To combat this, the professor suggests zooming in on a portion of the spectrogram where the differences are obvious. The professor also mentions that reverberation changes the spectrum or cepstrum.\nAdditionally, the professor says that getting rid of five hertz noise doesn't take any deep new methods. In general, the professor thinks they should be careful about spending too much time on exactly what another group is doing.",
    "The team decided on a snowman-shaped remote control, foregoing an LCD display and talk-back features to cut costs. It will be powered by batteries, not kinetic energy. The remote will have rubber buttons, some with backlighting using internal LEDs. A jog-dial will be included. The slogan will be incorporated somewhere on the device.\n\nThe team also discussed the dimensions of the remote control, settling on a size that fits comfortably in the palm of the hand. The red button will serve as the power button when held for two seconds and as a confirm button for the menu.\n\nThe marketing expert expressed concern that the design was too basic and that the team had to remove too many features to meet the budget. The team also discussed the possibility of using an entirely rubber frame, but this was deemed too expensive. The team ultimately agreed to remove the LCD panel and the advanced chip to save money.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the project manager seems to be supportive of the plastic material with a rubber casing for the remote control. During the first meeting, the project manager mentioned that having a \"yellow banana shaped case with a rubber material around it to feel spongy\" was okay from a financial aspect. The project manager also agreed that the fruit shape was fashionable. In the second meeting, the project manager seems to like the design of the prototype and believes it is beautiful and incorporates everything that was discussed. During the third meeting, the project manager likes that the remote looks cool and has the technology that they want. Overall, the project manager seems to be on board with the current direction of the product's material, cover, color, and shape.\n",
    "The team discussed several approaches to fixing the system and improving the baseline. One area of focus was on latency, with the goal of reducing it to under 250 milliseconds. Proposed solutions included designing new IIR filters with the same frequency response as the FIR filters, implementing a nice downsampling filter, and optimizing the on-line normalization process.\n\nAnother approach involved spectral subtraction from Ericsson. This would be applied on the mel frequency bands, either before or after voice activity detection (VAD). The goal was to have a discriminant and linear transformation. The team also discussed the potential benefits of using a third-party VAD to determine boundaries, allowing for better noise estimation outside of speech segments.",
    "The meetings covered a range of topics including proposed legislation, government support, and the pandemic's impact on various sectors.\n\nRegarding legislation, discussions included a ban on cosmetic animal testing, mandatory life jackets for children on small vessels, and organ harvesting.\n\nInfrastructural construction was also discussed including sports infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, and energy corridors.\n\nGovernment support for energy resources, tourism, green economy, and small businesses was also discussed. This included financial assistance for large employers, the oil and gas sector, agriculture, and tourism. Several members of parliament voiced concerns about the existing requirements for businesses to qualify for government support.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 was a major theme, particularly its effects on the fishing, tourism, oil, and gas sectors. Issues included job losses, market disruptions, and the need for sector-specific support measures.\n",
    "The team discussed various aspects of the remote control's design and functionality. Initially, there was a focus on simplicity and limiting the number of buttons for user-friendliness. The team explored changing from the traditional rectangular shape to something more modern and sleek, with the possibility of a fruit or vegetable-inspired design.\n\nPersonalization was considered, with ideas like removable covers or different options for male and female target groups. However, the team seemed to lean away from an overt fruit/vegetable shape, with the project manager suggesting implied shapes might be sufficient.\n\nThe team also considered novel shapes, like one that fits the hand, but the final decision on the casing shape seemed to be plastic with rubber grips. The discussion also touched upon materials, with titanium being considered but likely too expensive. Ultimately, the team decided on a plastic case with rubber grips, incorporating a scroll wheel and an LCD screen, which would require a more expensive chip.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed lemon or lime colors for the product based on recent fashion trends indicating that fruits and vegetables are becoming increasingly important themes for clothing, shoes, and furniture. This trend aligns with a broader shift towards organic and natural elements in consumer preferences.\n\nThe team believed incorporating these colors could make the remote control more visually appealing and trendy, potentially increasing its marketability and sales. The spongy feel of the material, combined with the fruit-inspired colors, was also intended to cater to the current consumer desire for products with a unique and tactile experience.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the overall conclusion regarding the remote control is a need to balance user-friendliness, market trends, and cost-effectiveness while minimizing repetitive strain injury. Market research suggests that users prefer simplicity and ease of use, with many only utilizing a small percentage of the buttons on existing remotes. \n\nThe team is considering a design that incorporates fewer buttons and possibly a spongy, ergonomic design to prevent RSI. The market research also showed there was interest in speech recognition, a screen, and glow-in-the-dark features.\n\nThe team is targeting a younger audience and the elderly, and are considering incorporating solar energy to appeal to ecologically minded consumers. The design team will try to incorporate the company slogan and corporate colors into the design. The ultimate goal is to create a fashionable, functional remote control that stands out in the market while staying within budget and meeting the needs of the target demographic.\n",
    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) assessed that Brexit poses risks to higher education, particularly concerning funding, EU student recruitment, and research collaborations. Decreases in applications from EU and non-EU students were noted, potentially due to changes in student support and perceptions of welcome. Committee members and HEFCW members expressed concerns about the financial sustainability of Welsh institutions given the current funding arrangements. \n\nDiscussions on women's issues included HEFCW members considering diversity in university governing bodies, and the committee noted that the upcoming legislation would be explored in how it could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance.\n\nThe committee's statements on housing were not included in the meeting transcripts.\n\nMembers discussed various aspects of higher education, including the impact of Brexit, funding challenges, student recruitment, governance, quality assurance, and the role of HEFCW. Members expressed concerns about ensuring the financial sustainability of Welsh institutions and maintaining high standards of education.\n",
    "The meeting transcript contains a discussion regarding the digit recordings. It was reported that the system works fine after the meeting starts, but gives an error message when attempting to start prior to the meeting. It was suggested that the digit recordings be done at the end of the meeting to accommodate participants running off to other meetings. The group discussed the nature of the data being collected. One member wanted to get more data to research, and Berkeley people posting notes were having issues with determining who the speakers were. It was determined that more regular meetings of known types should be the focus, rather than a mishmash of one-offs. It would be difficult to process the data to figure out the type of meeting it is and do higher-level work. It was also mentioned that there should be multiple meetings by the same group, but hopefully, they have different summaries. The group also discussed having some random scattered meetings for acoustic purposes. The discussion ended with the consensus that the meeting should be held in English.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the primary reason for recommending a speech recognition interface is its potential as a key selling point and innovative feature for the remote control. The user interface designer expressed it was one of her favorite features, the marketing representative saw it as a way to differentiate the product from competitors and build a marketing campaign around it. The industrial designer did not express any opinions about the feature. The user interface designer thought it would be a function that advanced users would find easy to use.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts contain no discussion of consortia, regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, statements by Jassa Scott, comments on the Auditor General, or Bill Blair's response to the firearms seizure issue at Pearson airport. Additionally, the transcripts do not contain information on the political background and aim of the group.\n",
    "The team discussed several functions for the remote. The most prominent was the \"lost-and-found\" function, which would allow users to locate a misplaced remote via a beeping sound. This idea evolved into potentially including a charging base station for the remote, similar to a cordless phone, with a button on the base to activate the beeping function.\n\nImprovements from project evaluation included simplifying the button layout based on user research indicating that most users only utilize a small percentage of the buttons on existing remotes. There was discussion about a large on/off button, catering to an older demographic.\n\nNew functions brainstormed included speech recognition, targeting both convenience and accessibility for disabled users. The team debated including numbers on the remote, considering alternatives like voice command or scrolling through channels. There was also a discussion about a menu button to access audio, video, and language settings, potentially displayed on the TV screen. A small screen on the remote to explain the function of buttons was also discussed.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the group considered the cost implications of using special colors for the buttons. Initially, the assumption was that only the red apple button would have a different color. However, the industrial designer separated the volume and channel buttons by using orange, which increased production costs. Marketing expressed dissatisfaction because the initial cost estimates were based on only one button having a special color.\n\nTo reduce costs, the team explored options like keeping all buttons the same color or removing special colors altogether, which would allow for the inclusion of voice recognition features. Marketing seemed open to these changes as long as they could maintain a sense of \"fanciness\" and \"fashionability\" in the design. The group later suggested making the volume buttons a different shape to compensate for the loss of color differentiation, indicating a willingness to compromise on the color scheme to meet budget constraints and marketing goals.\n",
    "The key points regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension include the importance of employer voices being reflected in the development of the baccalaureate, the need for greater working between education and employers, and the development of a joint communication plan with Qualifications Wales.\n\nRegarding employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, there is a general consensus that employers don't understand or value the qualification. Suggestions for improvement include employers feeling ownership of the qualification, better communication of the nature of the qualification, and employers becoming more engaged with the education system.\n\nThere is no discussion on the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales in the provided text.",
    "The group generally felt the presentation materials were convenient for conveying ideas, with some reservations. The industrial designer found the materials helpful for illustrating component properties and material choices, and the user interface designer used them to showcase interface ideas, though admitting their 3D modeling skills were limited.\n\nHowever, there was discussion on the practicality of certain features presented, such as the LCD screen. Some felt it was innovative, while others questioned its necessity and coherence with the remote's intended sturdiness. The marketing perspective highlighted the importance of ease of use for both young and elderly users, suggesting that large, basic buttons might be more user-friendly than complex menus on an LCD screen. Overall, the group valued the presentation materials as a starting point but recognized the need for further refinement and consideration of user needs and design coherence.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to cost concerns. The advanced chip required to operate the LCD display would increase the overall expense of the remote. Additionally, there was a question of the value an LCD screen would add to the user experience. Since the remote was intended to be universal, it wouldn't receive information back from the television. This limited the LCD screen's functionality to displaying the channel last sent, which the team felt didn't justify the added cost. There was also concern that consumers would not be willing to pay for a remote with an LCD display.\n",
    "The team members introduced themselves by their names and expertise: Marketing Expert, Industrial Designer (Xavier Juergens), and User Interface Designer. The project is to design an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control for television sets, inspired by the latest trends in fashion and interior design.\n\nThe brainstorming process involved using a SMARTboard to illustrate ideas and sharing files in a project folder. Initial ideas included creating a multi-remote control compatible with various devices, focusing on intuitive design and usability for disabled users, and using light materials. The selling price was set at twenty-five Euros, with a production cost limit of twelve and a half Euros.\n\nProject evaluation involved discussing current remote controls, competitor products, and international market considerations. The team explored making the remote compatible with other devices and ensuring it is user-friendly across different cultures.\n\nThe project process involves individual work followed by meetings to share information. The team will use project management and document folders to share their work.\n",
    "During discussions about adding extra designs or gadgets to make the remote control special, the team considered including rechargeable units, but ultimately decided against it. There was a preference for a long-lasting battery guaranteed for the life of the product due to concerns about the practicality and reliability of rechargeable options. The team also felt consumers would be more inclined to replace the remote for fashion reasons before the battery life became an issue. The team also thought that by having a sealed unit, it would lead to greater reliability.\n",
    "The group decided to use a digital filter suggested by Dan to address the issue of low-frequency noise (around 5 Hz) picked up by the PDA microphones, specifically from air conditioners. They considered changing a capacitor on the input box, but feared it could cause other problems. They will check if the STRUT implementation has a high-pass filter or pre-emphasis. They will also use cheap microphones, and ensure the filtering is done before processing the audio. They also discussed the high-pass filter option in Feacalc. The group will change the picture on the website since it is not a good illustration because it is noise and not reverberation.\n",
    "Meilyr Rowlands stated that secondary schools face greater challenges than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum. He expressed concern that while primary schools generally maintain constant surpluses and reserves, secondary schools are increasingly in deficit. This financial strain impacts secondary schools' ability to create the necessary space for teachers to focus on the curriculum. He also highlighted the difficulties in recruiting teachers, particularly in secondary schools.\nKirsty Williams AM talked about the importance of having a community-focused approach to schools. She noted that it's very difficult for children to do well in school if they've got all kinds of things happening in their background, so it's important that schools can maybe signpost those families to other services that can support them and help them. She also noted that Pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that's been a consistent theme as well from your reports.",
    "The Industrial Designer contributed several ideas and considerations regarding the new spherical remote control's design, style, and functions. They emphasized the importance of user-friendliness and trendiness in the design. \n\nDuring discussions, the Industrial Designer suggested that navigation buttons and the user interface on the TV screen should allow easy navigation through channels, programs, and content. They also acknowledged the need to consider the technical aspects of new functions, such as browsing by content, which could be more complex than browsing by channel. \n\nAdditionally, the Industrial Designer highlighted the need to test the design thoroughly, especially if it deviates significantly from the norm, to ensure it works effectively. They also pointed out the importance of having the buttons that are used most often accessible, even when the remote is folded or closed.\n",
    "The group has a strong opinion on the Erasmus and mobility funding. There is a consensus among the Welsh Government, universities, and students about the importance of participation in the scheme. They are clear about the importance of providing security and stability for staff, making sure they send very clear messages that they're very welcome and they value their contribution.\n\nThe group did not come to a consensus on the topic of whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees. The group does acknowledge that under the current regime, Wales was punching above its weight in terms of attracting students and we've lost that advantage.\n",
    "The meetings discussed several topics. Local authoritative frameworks were not mentioned. Condolences were not mentioned. Discussions on employment were not mentioned. Workers' safety was briefly mentioned in reference to repetitive strain injuries (RSI) related to remote control use. Pay dispute situations were not mentioned. The main discussion topics included the design of a remote control, including its user interface, materials, shape, and color schemes. There was also discussion on whether to include speech recognition, teletext, or a wired connection.\n",
    "The reasons for expressing thanks to the House of Commons and the members of the Canadian Armed Forces from Whitehorse were not explicitly stated in this document.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's functions, characters, and design requirements. They prioritized the basic functions of changing channels, volume, and power, deeming them most important based on user research. The team considered various aspects, including user-friendliness, aesthetics, and ergonomics.\n\nThe group explored the possibility of a scroll feature for channel selection, drawing inspiration from the iPod's interface. Ideas included a touch-sensitive disc or a circular region with up/down functionality. They debated whether the scroll feature should also control volume or if separate buttons were needed. The challenges of integrating this feature and ensuring ease of use were also discussed, especially considering the target demographic.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion revolve around designing a new television remote control. The team reflects on the previous meeting's minutes and approved decisions such as the target market, core functions (volume, power, channel, etc.), and Sarah's task to research competitor costs. Marketing presented trend research, highlighting the importance of \"fancy\" and technologically innovative fabrics, suggesting spongy, interchangeable fruit-shaped sleeves for the remote. The industrial designer, however, provided a reality check, outlining component options, including battery, kinetic, or solar power sources, and case materials like wood, plastic, titanium, or rubber. The user interface team proposed a simple interface with a few buttons corresponding to a menu displayed on the television screen, favoring push-button technology to reduce costs.\n\nThe upcoming team meeting aims to finalize decisions on the remote's key components, including energy source (kinetic favored), case material (rubber or spongy material with a hard plastic inner shell), and interface (push buttons). Marketing did not discuss repetitive strain injury in this meeting.\n",
    "The lab tests indicated that customers found remote controls visually unappealing and functionally mismatched to their usage habits, primarily utilizing only about 10% of the buttons. The group prioritized button design based on frequency of use, suggesting a single settings button for less frequently accessed functions.\n\nDiscussions about the finder button led to the agreement to include it, targeting teenagers and young professionals, with a separate sender unit potentially sold with the remote. The team favored a buzzer over a light for the finder function.\n\nRegarding button design, the team considered a minimal button approach, potentially using a touchpad-like interface similar to an iPod. They also discussed the use of a scroll wheel, but that idea was scrapped.\n\nRegarding the presentation connecting the project with market interests, the team agreed to use a rubber case, with one single curve. They also agreed on using rubber buttons, not \"spongy feel buttons\". They also agreed to have the standby button be shaped like a big, red apple.\n",
    "The team discussed DAT, power cables, and capturing subject intention. The team is trying to capture the subject's intention by analyzing the semantics of the belief-net, the natural language used, and the parameters that influence their choices. They considered using CrossPads for note-taking, digital pictures of the table and boards, and asking participants to mention something interesting they learned during the meeting. They also discussed the possibility of oral summaries after the meeting.\n\nThe team also considered various approaches for analysis, including: Summaries, Keyword searches, Focus on action items, Note-taking, Recorded summaries. They discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and the need to balance thoroughness with intrusiveness.\n",
    "The group discussed the general specifications and case design for a new remote control. The industrial designer presented options for the case shape (flat, curved, or double-curved) and materials (plastic with potential additions like wood, latex, or titanium). A double-curved case would exclude the use of titanium.\n\nThe group decided on a titanium back and a hard plastic front for the case, with changeable fronts in different fruit and vegetable colors to align with current fashion trends. The changeable covers could potentially be made of a spongy latex material for better grip and ergonomics. \n\nThe team decided to move forward with pushbuttons for the user interface and a simple chip to minimize costs. They also decided to put the L_C_D_ screen at the bottom of the remote.",
    "Huw David did not participate in the eleventh evidence session. In the sixth scrutiny session, Huw David, representing the Welsh Local Government Association, generally supported the Bill, emphasizing the paramount role of the state in protecting children from harm. He believed physical punishment constitutes harm and should be prevented. He acknowledged the cultural shift in Wales, where most parents no longer support physical punishment.\n\nRegarding unintended consequences, David hoped there would be none if the Bill was implemented carefully with adequate resources. He stressed the importance of resources being available, as social services are already overstretched. He also emphasized the need to support families through early intervention and prevention programs to avoid children being taken into care.\n\nAddressing whether the Bill should explicitly state its intentions, David initially deferred to Welsh Government's commitment to raising awareness. However, he later supported including a duty on Welsh Government Ministers to raise awareness in the Bill itself, ensuring its success and preventing parents from feeling criminalized.\n",
    "The group considered several aspects of the two-sided remote control. Market research indicated that the target demographic of 40-65 year olds constituted the largest portion of the market and that many users only utilized about 10% of the buttons on a standard remote.\n\nFunctionality-wise, there was discussion about including a beeping function to locate lost remotes, an LCD screen for ease of use, and teletext for subtitles, though the latter was debated due to the rise of internet-enabled TVs. A docking station for recharging and locating the remote was also proposed. Voice recognition was considered but potentially reserved for another product line.\n\nDesign ideas included a telephone-shaped remote and docking station, interchangeable cases (wood-like and grey-black), and a curved shape for ergonomic purposes and screen placement. Button placement was discussed with consideration for left-handed users and RSI concerns. There was no discussion of waterproof or shockproof capabilities.\n",
    "The discussions in group 3 revolved around amendments concerning the regulation-making powers within the Bill, particularly concerning section 1. The Deputy Minister sought to add existing powers back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent.\n\nSuzy Davies introduced amendment 3A as a \"probing amendment.\" She questioned whether the \"transitory, transitional and saving provisions\" were sufficient powers for the Welsh Ministers. She suggested amending the Bill to grant a more unrestricted power to make regulations for implementing section 1, especially given the changes made to the initial draft. Davies proposed this to ensure the Assembly could scrutinize anything introduced under section 1, as statutory instruments could still be implemented without procedure. She described amendment 3A as a holding position, open for further discussion before Stage 3.\n\nThe Deputy Minister responded that they did not think it necessary to have wider powers, but they will keep this under review and discuss this further before Stage 3.\n",
    "Brexit has impacted Welsh higher education institutions by causing uncertainty in management, potentially reducing the richness of the student experience, and affecting research collaborations. The number of EU student applications to Welsh institutions has decreased by 8%, contrasting with a 2% increase in English institutions. This decrease may be attributed to changes in student support arrangements for EU students, which now require them to pay full fees, and the relative investment in facilities compared to England.\n\nExecutives are addressing Brexit by monitoring financial forecasts, assessing risks, and exploring potential impacts with a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group. They are also focusing on promoting Wales as a study destination and working with UK universities to advocate for continued access to EU research funding. Universities are developing contingency plans and considering various scenarios, including cost reduction measures. Fee and access plans are being used to enhance student mobility and protect student interests.\n\nThere was no questioning or mention of local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks.\n\nThere was also no mention of updates on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada.",
    "The Welsh government aims to support both children's development and parents' employment, viewing high-quality early childhood education and care as beneficial for both. The government acknowledges the current system is complex and needs simplification, working with local authorities and health boards to achieve this. \n\nEight local authority areas are involved in pathfinder projects to reorganize services for improved accessibility and effectiveness, taking a child-centered approach while also supporting parents. While co-location of services is encouraged, it's not universally feasible. There are variations in early education provision across Wales, influenced by local authority decisions, but the quality is generally good. The government is exploring consistent funding rates for education and childcare.\n\nThe government acknowledged concerns about the distribution of early childhood education and care, and the impact on the foundation phase. The government also intends to extend the childcare offer to those in training and education. \n\nFlying Start, a geographically targeted program, aims to reach the most disadvantaged children, but it doesn't reach all children in poverty. The collaborative nature of Flying Start, involving health visitors, speech therapists, and childcare, is considered key. The government is exploring ways to make Flying Start more accessible to a wider group of children.",
    "The marketing expert, Sammy Benjo, emphasizes the importance of user-centric design and marketability. Benjo stresses gathering user feedback through surveys to understand their preferences and pain points with existing remote controls. According to the market expert, users find current remotes unattractive, difficult to use, and often lose them. Benjo notes that users are willing to pay for aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly remote controls.\n\nBenjo advocates for features like easy zapping, clearly visible and accessible frequently used buttons, and a function to locate the remote. The marketing expert suggests targeting younger demographics with high-tech features like speech recognition and LCD displays. The expert stresses that the product needs \"sizzle\" and must be attractive to impulse buyers at a price point of around twenty-five euros. The expert advocates for a simple, intuitive design with a short learning curve.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts primarily discussed the post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. \n\nThe discussion included whether the Act has fulfilled the government's objectives, with differing views on its effectiveness in achieving its four strategic aims: regulating institutions, safeguarding public contributions, maintaining fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy. Some felt the legislation wasn't strong enough and that objectives had to be driven through annual remit letters. There was a discussion on whether the Act was framed in a way that made it difficult for institutions to fulfill national outcomes.\n\nThe meeting also touched on the regulation of private providers, the requirement for charitable status, and the regulation of part-time and postgraduate fees. There was a concern that the 2012 university funding system limited the Welsh Government's policy leverage over the sector and how the Act addressed this. The discussion also included HEFCW's powers of intervention, the benefits of national targets, and the need for more effective policy levers to align the sector to social, economic, and civic needs. There was concern that the HE Act didn't encourage collaboration and whether this would be addressed in the PCET Bill.",

    "CD's for backup were mentioned in the context of data transfer to IBM for transcription. The data was planned to be sent to IBM on CD-ROM, and then IBM would transfer it to analog tape for their transcription service.\n\nThe discussion on probability computation was not explicitly discussed in the meeting transcripts.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system was alluded to throughout the meeting. The experiment was being conducted by various members of the group. The location of the experiment was centered around Heidelberg. The group mentioned using the \"SmartKom\" system for data collection. They were also considering using CrossPads to collect more data and potentially using digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting.\n",
    "The group decided against symmetrical button positioning because they wanted to ensure that the most commonly used function, the program button, was easily accessible to the user's thumb. The Industrial Designer noted that most users are right-handed, so the design prioritized right-handed thumb placement near the program button.\n\nRegarding the Project Manager's suggestion of creating right- and left-handed remotes during the prototype presentation, the team had mixed reactions. The User Interface designer supported the idea. However, the Marketing representative questioned the practicality of families needing two remotes and suggested that users could adapt to using either hand. The Industrial Designer pointed out that left-handed and right-handed people share computers, but use a right-handed mouse. Ultimately, the team seemed hesitant about the suggestion due to concerns about cost and user convenience.\n",
    "The group discussed several options for cost reduction to meet the 12.5 Euro production cost target. The Project Manager initially proposed scrapping speech recognition and offering custom covers separately. This was met with disagreement due to the importance of trendiness in the design.\n\nAlternative suggestions included removing a special color, using plastic instead of rubber for the basic cover, and eliminating the curved design. Ultimately, the group decided to remove speech recognition and the special color to meet the budget. They agreed to offer custom covers as an option to maintain the trendy aspect of the product. The team also discussed the possibility of using plastic instead of rubber for the basic cover to further reduce costs, but ultimately decided to keep the rubber material due to its durability and unique \"squishy\" feel, which was favored in marketing research.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts discuss voice activity detectors (VAD) in the context of the Aurora project.\n\nPros:\n*   Voice activity detectors can improve speech recognition performance. One participant mentions that endpointing a mel cepstrum gets a 21% improvement overall and a 27% improvement on SpeechDat-Car.\n*   Voice recognition sets the product apart and attracts a younger market.\n\nCons:\n*   Competitors might copy the algorithms, even if some aspects are not patentable. One participant expressed concern that other companies would take apart the algorithms and use the blocks from them.\n*   Voice recognition can be costly.\n*   Voice recognition may not be reliable in noisy environments.\n*   Voice recognition may require significant latency.",
    "The discussion on battery options included the Industrial Designer's consideration of solar cells with a backup battery, kinetic energy, and regular batteries. They emphasized that the company had limits on the batteries they could use and the importance of a long-lasting battery, guaranteed for the product's life.\n\nThe Industrial Designer expressed that solar energy might not be ideal due to the remote's potential use at night or in cluttered environments. The designer suggested titanium for the case because it's trendy and modern.\n\nThe Industrial Designer recommended a charger for the industrial working design, as they believed it would be too boring to change the batteries of the remotes. This would also include a small button on the charger that would make the remote beep, helping users locate misplaced remotes.\n",

    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several interconnected concerns regarding the Welsh Government's childcare offer.\n\nA primary concern was the single national fee rate of \u00a34.50. Irranca-Davies acknowledged that while welcomed in some areas like Blaenau Gwent, its viability was uncertain in more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport. There was apprehension that this rate might lead to a two-tiered system, where wealthier parents could afford add-ons (transport, trips, food), disadvantaging lower-income working families.\n\nAccess plans and affordability for the lowest-income working families were also questioned. While the \u00a34.50 rate aimed to provide wraparound childcare, it didn't cover additional costs, potentially burdening families with limited financial means.\n\nDavid and Irranca-Davies discussed the pilot programs in Cardiff and Newport, recognizing the need to assess the \u00a34.50 rate's suitability in these higher-cost areas.\n\nFinally, the qualification and quality of the childcare workforce were addressed, acknowledging the need to balance affordability with maintaining and improving workforce quality.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line normalization centered around its implementation and potential issues. PhD B discussed the delay introduced by the recursion used for mean estimation (85 milliseconds). The professor suggested exploring alternative approaches, such as incorporating noise removal directly into the filtering process. PhD C mentioned experimenting with different on-line normalization tunings for different MFCCs, but found normalizing C-zero to be most important.\n\nRegarding phase normalization, Grad F had previously tried a long-term mean subtraction approach but obtained poor results. Grad G is investigating complex arithmetic methods to address phase issues, potentially dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of subtracting in the log domain. PhD C mentioned that the phase may not be something to be removed.\n\nThe transcripts do not contain the opinion of PhD C or the professor on phase normalization and quals.\n",
    "The discussion covered several aspects of detecting important linguistic features in the meeting recordings.\n\nFirst, the team discussed using channel-specific speech/non-speech detection to distinguish between foreground and background speech. The goal was to normalize features like energy and loudness, but challenges arose when speakers were quiet or absent in a channel. It was suggested that transcribers could manually annotate speech/non-speech in specific channels to create reference data for training the system.\n\nSecond, there was a discussion of modeling articulatory features, including overlap. There was some concern that digits may not be the best data to use since articulation may be clearer than spontaneous speech. It was also suggested that labeling the non-word words may be of interest.\n\nFinally, the team explored the use of Noisy-ORs to handle situations where transcribers were unsure about which speaker produced a breath sound. The idea was to create an extra channel for uncertain sounds, which could be cleaned up in post-processing. The team also discussed how to adapt the transcription format to facilitate processing by the SRI recognizer, including handling acronyms and stripping out linguistically rich comments while retaining information useful for reject models.\n",
    "The group discussed incorporating system elements into demos. Grad H has been using THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, and there was discussion about the user interface, including potentially merging Transcriber and THISL IR. Professor B suggested contacting Dan to see if Autoconf can be used. There was also talk of using the prosody work Don is doing.\n\nRegarding backups, Dave Johnson suggested NW archive to copy meeting recorder data and have it backed up, instead of putting the Meeting Recorder stuff on non-backed-up disk.\n\nThe group also discussed collecting notes with CrossPads, but they are not routinely used because of the extra work involved and the difficulty of synchronizing the time. Professor B suggested returning one. It was also mentioned that they could schedule periods where someone listens and creates a summary. It was agreed they would try CrossPads to collect more information that could be useful later for the UI stuff. Professor B suggested they try to get a variety of meetings and to not specify rules of interaction.",
    "The discussion about HMRC centered on the decision to end the work with them. Julie Morgan explained that one of the major reasons for ending the relationship with HMRC was the desire for a more flexible system. She said that if training and education were brought into the childcare offer, it would need to be done through local authorities, which wouldn't be possible via HMRC. Also, those with immigration status of no resource from public funds would have to be dealt with via the local authorities.\n\nMorgan said that, due to the work with HMRC, they had learned where they needed to go and that she felt it was the best place to go. She also stated that local authorities are much closer to the local public than HMRC and are able to build up links with families and help with difficult issues. She complimented the relationship with HMRC and local authorities.\n\nNicola Edwards added that HMRC could process things bilingually but, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it.\n\nJo-anne Daniels said that the costs that HMRC presented at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs initially outlined. She concluded that they can deliver a cheaper and more flexible system by working with local authorities rather than HMRC.",
    "Professor B commented that they should get started on building the influence links and belief nodes. The professor suggested they start with the path ones.\n\nGrad A commented on the user being more likely to enter if local and view if a tourist.\n\nFor the new form arrangement, the professor suggested having three intermediate nodes for the endpoint decision: as seen from the user model, the ontology, and the discourse.\n\nThe suggested structure of the belief net involved the combination of endpoint decisions, with an intermediate structure that is essentially the OR of selling, fixing, or servicing.\n\nGrad B did not comment on the structure of the belief net.\n",
    "Grad E and Grad A have different experiments, and their opinions are discussed independently. Grad A is working on a pedagogical belief net that can be used to conceptually expand nodes. Grad A conceptually grouped the nodes by how they fit into image schemas related to trajector-landmark and source-path-goal. The goal of Grad A's belief net is to isolate things related to the trajector, context, and discourse so they can be grouped. Grad E is working on an experiment that involves detecting overlapping zones in recorded speech. Grad E transcribes recorded speech and marks acoustic events and overlapping zones to find a good solution to detect speech. Grad E wants to test the parameters with other acoustic events to find false hypotheses that are produced when using pitch, difference, and feature parameters.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) team initially championed a \"banana\" shaped remote control with scroll wheels for volume and channel selection, and a \"turbo\" button for both switching on the TV and skipping channels. They designed an attractive base station with a banana leaf look to house the remote and act as an antenna, which was both form and function.\n\nHowever, concerns arose regarding the practicality of teletext navigation using scroll wheels and the lack of dedicated number buttons, leading to marketing team's skepticism. The industrial designer raised concerns about the cost implications of features like solar cells and advanced chips.\n\nUltimately, the team decided against the solar cells and focused on a recharging base station. They opted for a regular chip to stay within budget, sacrificing more functional buttons. The final design aimed for a trendy aesthetic, targeting younger users who prioritize style over traditional button layouts. The team considered radio wave interference in the base station's design but did not implement kinetic charging. The extra budget was used for R&D.\n",
    "The professor and the team had a long discussion about noise suppression techniques, including spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering. The professor notes that these techniques are fundamentally similar but differ mathematically, particularly in the exponent used for ideal filtering. The choice between spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering is less significant than other factors like over-subtraction, smoothing, and whether to operate on mel bands or FFT bins.\n\nThe professor notes that it is difficult to add noise at the right level, but it is done after cleaning up the mel bins. There was also discussion on noise estimation and the use of VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to improve it. The professor suggests a compromise between relying solely on the first fifteen frames and always depending on a pause for noise estimation. The group also discussed the impact of stationary and non-stationary noise on the noise spectrum.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function as primarily sending messages to the television, including turning it on/off, changing channels, and adjusting volume. There was discussion on including functions for DVD/VCR, but it was decided to focus on television-only functions. The remote should have basic functions such as on/off, volume, mute, and channel up/down.\n\nThe kinetic function was discussed as a way to reduce the number of buttons. The group considered a touch screen with a wheel-like interface, similar to an iPod, for scrolling through channels and adjusting volume. A separate function switch button was considered to allow the wheel to control different functions for the television. The ability to find the remote when lost was important, and the group considered a \"paging\" feature where a button on the TV or a separate base station would cause the remote to beep or vibrate. Voice recognition was also discussed as a way to control the remote, especially for younger users.\n",
    "The team proposed a design for implementing demographic marketing strategies focused on a remote control that combined battery and kinetic energy sources. The case would be double-curved and rubberized, featuring a flashy, fruity color with removable covers.\n\nThe marketing team emphasized the importance of a fancy look and feel over pure functionality, suggesting innovative elements like lights that activate upon touch. They also mentioned a top European fashion trend of incorporating fruit and vegetables into designs, advising caution against literal interpretations but suggesting themes like lemon or lime to unify the product's identity.\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing agreed that presentations on appearance design would be given in a specific order, starting with Andrew, then Craig, and finally David.\n\nThe Industrial Designer proposed kinetic energy as a marketing gimmick, suggesting it would appeal to tech enthusiasts and provide a unique selling point. Marketing agreed with the concept. Marketing expressed concerns that the team was leaning toward low-tech features like rubber buttons and a plastic frame. They proposed transparent, tinted cases to showcase the corporate color (yellow) and create a glowing effect. They suggested a jog dial as an innovative control method for volume and channels.\n",
    "Grad G believed that the cross-language issue was not that big of a deal. The professor did not agree and thought they could not ignore it. Grad G thinks that Speech, Noise detection or Voiced-Sound-Unvoiced-Sound detection could be important for noise. The professor wanted to figure out if there was something that was a good thing to do because of a time crunch.\n\nThe professor believed that Fey sounded fine and was more present than in conversation and did a better job than expected. Grad D said that Fey did a wonderful job and responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for. Grad D also thought that if they gave Fey even more instruments to work with, the results would be even better.",
    "The Industrial Designer expressed several thoughts on the remote control's design and technology. Regarding appearance, they acknowledged the marketing team's findings that a \"fancy look and feel\" is most important to consumers, aligning with current fashion trends of \"fruit and vegetables\" and \"spongy\" textures. They considered wood and plastic materials, leaning towards plastic for cost-effectiveness but acknowledging wood's potential for a high-class aesthetic.\n\nRegarding technology, the Industrial Designer initially supported lighted L_C_D_ buttons for nighttime visibility but was concerned about the cost. They were open to incorporating solar energy as an innovative and eco-friendly power source. They acknowledged that the limited vocabulary of speech recognition and gesture recognition are reliable and can be used, but voiced concern about the language problem, and the reliability and usability of voice or gesture recognition, especially in a family setting. They also agreed that there should be some added value.\n",
    "Priority of inspections, the reopening of the House of Commons in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations, and the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism were discussed in the meetings.\n\nIt is not noted in the meeting transcripts what Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders' agreement was on the priority of inspections.\n\nJustin Trudeau elaborated on the governmental fund and his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions when discussing the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism. He states that the government has taken concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, and injustice across the country. He mentions significant investments to enable mental health services for people who have experienced racism and the creation of the anti-racism secretariat with a $4.6 million envelope to address systemic barriers. While progress has been made, there is still much more to do.\n",
    "The group discussed the technical and functional designs, prototype presentation, detailed design, and specific designing requirements of the remote control, with the aim of creating a user-friendly and fashionable product. The remote control should have basic functions such as sending messages to the TV, changing channels, and turning the TV on and off. The remote must be easily findable, possibly through a homing device or a buzzer.\n\nThe group also considered speech recognition as an up-and-coming feature that consumers are interested in and also incorporating a corporate image onto the remote.\nThe industrial designer presented a rough schematic of the remote, including a power source, smart chip, and infrared bulb. The user interface designer suggested larger buttons and a simplified design with fewer buttons.\n",
    "The team's discussion and evaluation of the project's process, work division, and production plan revealed several key points. They felt somewhat stifled creatively by the initial restriction to a TV remote but acknowledged having control over the technological and fashionable aspects of the design. Teamwork was generally positive, although the survey process was considered irritating.\n\nRegarding the production plan, the team focused on staying within a 12.50 Euro budget. They debated battery types (lithium vs. AAA), ultimately opting for lithium. They also discussed the number of interfaces needed for the scroll wheel and push-buttons, considering options for the top and sides of the remote. The team made the decision to drop speech recognition and the speaker to bring the final design within budget.\n\nTeam members felt that the deadlines were very short and that they would have benefited from more collaboration and information sharing. Some team members found the SMARTboard technology not to be particularly useful. Overall, while satisfied with the final product, the team agreed that improvements could be made to the process, particularly in communication, teamwork, and time management.\n",
    "The discussion on future directions revolved around improving the transcription process and exploring methods for generating queries for meeting data. PhD A discussed a new version of presegmentation using channel-specific speech/non-speech detection. The group also considered articulatory feature modeling and the potential use of transcribers for this task.\n\nPhD D explained his work on a multilingual model. PhD C and the professor discussed the challenges of multiple languages and the need for realistic users in testing dialogue systems.\n\nThe group discussed releasing meeting data and allowing people to cut things out to generate queries. They explored using summaries, key words like \"action item,\" and input from meeting participants to identify potential queries. The group also considered the ethical implications of releasing data and the need to anonymize faces in video recordings.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement refers to the discrepancy between the planning and design of a program and its actual execution. She highlights that a program may be well-developed on paper but encounter challenges when implemented in real-world situations. This gap can arise due to various factors, such as unforeseen logistical hurdles, inadequate resources, lack of stakeholder buy-in, or differences in local contexts. Ms. Kwan's statement underscores the importance of not only creating sound programs but also carefully considering the practical aspects of their implementation to ensure they achieve their intended outcomes.",
    "The Project Manager believed the last meeting was a bit loose but necessary to loosen up and meet each other. They considered their presentation straightforward. They were unsure about the animal drawing exercise but participated, stating it was officially their idea.\n\nThe Project Manager seemed focused on cost and market reach, aiming for a selling price of twenty-five euros and sales of fifty million units. They emphasized the need for the remote to be original and trendy but also acknowledged the importance of user-friendliness. They valued the input of market research but also expressed personal preferences based on their own experiences with remote controls.\n\nThe group seemed to have different opinions on the shape and design of the remote, with varying ideas on button placement, size, and functionality. They discussed the need for international recognition, compatibility with other devices, and customization options.\n\nRegarding the animal drawing, the group did not have an opinion on using a panther as a drawing. They each had to draw their favorite animal.\n",
    "The team had varying opinions on the remote control's features. For multiple operations, the team agreed push-buttons were still needed for the channel numbers, but an LCD screen could be used for everything else. The team leaned towards incorporating an LCD screen, especially with a younger target demographic in mind, but recognized the potential for increased cost and complexity.\n\nThe microphone position was not fully discussed, but the team seemed to agree it would not take up too much space. The team also considered the possibility of a scrolling button for voice commands. The team agreed a spinning wheel, like on an iPod, could be incorporated, with buttons integrated into it. The buttons should be easily accessible, with a minimalist design on the outside.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, the primary challenge faced by the tourism industry in Canada stems from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has effectively \"burned tourism to the ground,\" as stated by a local leader, leading to a grim outlook for the tourism season and economic instability in regions heavily reliant on tourism. Small, seasonal tourism businesses are particularly vulnerable, struggling to qualify for government support programs due to their unique operational circumstances.\n\nWhile the transcripts don't detail specific measures, there's mention of the government's awareness of the sector's importance and efforts to provide support, including the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) loans, and commercial rent relief. However, the effectiveness of these measures is questioned, with concerns raised about the eligibility criteria and the limited reach of programs like commercial rent assistance.\n",
    "The presentation focused on the design, energy source, components, functional design, and prototype of the remote control.\n\n**Design:** The industrial designer suggested a titanium case for a trendy and modern look. However, manufacturing double-curved shapes with titanium proved problematic. Marketing research indicated that users find most remotes ugly and are willing to pay more for a fancy design. The final consensus was to explore a design that incorporates a \"fruit and vegetable\" aesthetic with a spongy feel, potentially using rubber materials.\n\n**Energy Source:** The options considered were solar energy, hand dynamo, kinetic energy storage, and regular batteries. It was decided to use batteries (small nickel or alkaline) due to concerns about the reliability of solar energy in cluttered environments and the feasibility of kinetic energy providing sufficient power.\n\n**Components:** The design will incorporate simple rubber push buttons instead of an LCD screen to reduce costs. A voice recognition chip will be included. The team will explore using an FPGA chip for functionalities.\n\n**Functional Design:** The remote's primary function is to send messages to the television. The design will incorporate a microphone for voice commands and a speaker to help locate the remote. They will explore speaker-dependent speech recognition. The remote will also feature a charging station.\n\n**Prototype:** A prototype will be built by the technical team to test communication and troubleshoot problems. Software functionalities will be added to a programmable chip later.\n",
    "The decision was made to move forward with the DARPA demo. The demo will showcase several components of the project together. The THISL tool will be used for information retrieval on meeting data. The Transcriber interface will also be demonstrated, possibly merged with THISL. Prosody work will be shown graphically. XML will be used as the general format for everything.\n\nThe paper analyzes overlaps in a 45-minute meeting, categorizing them by the number of speakers involved (two, three, or more). It also examines individual differences in overlapping and being overlapped.\n\nStatistics included in the paper are the number of overlaps per minute, the percentage of overlaps involving two, three, or more speakers, and the percentage of times a person was the overlapper versus the overlappee. The paper also notes the total number of overlaps in the meeting was 215, with only four minutes having no overlaps.\n",
    "The group agreed to train a recognizer using the digits corpus and test it against a TI-digits test set, expecting good performance initially, followed by poorer results with distant microphones. Their current technique involves manual transcription with scripts to handle false starts and miscues, but there's discussion about involving transcribers more directly in the digit extraction process.\n\nThe limitations of their current technique include potential errors due to prosodic differences between TI-digits and their corpus, and the difficulty of modeling articulatory features with overlapping processes in conversational speech.\n\nProgress-wise, they're nearing completion of the first test set, but delays arise from forms not being filled out and the need for manual correction of misreads.\n\nThe group is also exploring speech-nonspeech detection and channel-specific transcriptions to improve segmentation, but this is also causing delays.\n",
    "During the meeting transcripts, there was no discussion on the advantages of \"triple R\" over \"triple RC\" in the product's name.\n\nThe target age group was discussed, with a focus on younger, trendy individuals. The marketing team decided to target young people because trends indicated their interest in fruit and vegetable themes in fashion and products. Additionally, the survey suggested that the outlook of the remote control should have a fancy design rather than just a functional look and feel.\n\nThe selection of channels involved a discussion about the buttons. The team discussed the channels buttons, one to nine, and off zero to nine, and the button to choose higher channels than nine, the volume and channel quadrants, left and right, up and down arrows, to do the volume and channel. They also discussed the menu button and how to choose other options.\n",
    "The group discussed market research findings indicating users find remotes ugly and difficult to use, favoring channel and volume buttons. Desired features included a fancy look and feel, voice recognition (though age-dependent), and potentially an LCD screen.\n\nDesign opinions diverged. The UI designer favored simplicity and ease of use, with larger buttons for common functions. The industrial designer liked the idea of a spongy design with a seven-inch T_F_T_ screen. The marketing representative emphasized a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, and reflecting the company's image.\n\nThe need for a revolution in remote control interaction was discussed in terms of balancing conventional design with novel ideas. Voice recognition was considered but raised cost concerns. A pull-out or sliding section for less frequently used buttons was proposed to maintain simplicity for everyday use. Ultimately, the group decided on a banana shape with a peelable cover to reveal the less frequently used buttons.",
    "Kirsty Williams AM discussed several key aspects of the new curriculum. Regarding quality assurance, she emphasized that the curriculum was being co-constructed *with* the profession, not *imposed* upon it. Bethan Owen noted that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils. Williams explained that the four purposes would be set out in the legislation, as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience.\n\nThe five principles she explained included: regulation of institutions, safeguarding the contribution, maintaining a focus on fair access, and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. Expectations for new examinations and school qualifications are that qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum.\n\nIn response to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions, Williams highlighted the significant engagement and support received for the broad principles of the curriculum. She also mentioned that she would be making a statement in the near future of their intentions on how to respond to these issues.\n",
    "Likes:\n*   **Ergonomics and Aesthetics:** The team generally liked the shape and feel of the remote, with some considering it more beautiful than average remotes.\n*   **Simplicity:** The reduction to basic controls (channel and volume) was seen as a positive for ease of use.\n*   **Bright Color:** The yellow color was considered helpful for not losing the remote.\n*   **Fashionable:** The team considered the design fashionable and trendy, especially with the lighting.\n*   **Teamwork**: Team members enjoyed working together and felt they had control over the technological and fashionable aspects of the design.\n\nDislikes:\n*   **Color:** The initial color choice was considered ugly.\n*   **Size:** The remote was considered a bit too big.\n*   **Material:** The clay prototype was flimsy.\n*   **Lack of Innovation:** Some felt the design lacked innovation, aside from the scroll wheel.\n*   **Limited Functionality:** One team member disliked that the remote was only for TV use.\n*   **Restrictions:** One team member felt stifled by the company's restriction to TV remotes only.\n",
    "The meeting transcript discusses mean subtraction in the context of Speech Recognition, particularly for SRI experiments. One participant, grad e, conducted tests on mean log magnitude spectral subtraction for the SmartKom system, experimenting with different time windows for calculating the mean. They compared using a 12-second past-only window versus a 12-second centered window, noting a slight performance drop with the past-only approach. Further experiments explored the impact of training models with a 12-second mean subtraction window but testing with shorter windows (2, 4, 6 seconds). Results indicated a performance hit when training and testing windows differed, although the degradation was relatively small (less than 0.5% increase in word error rate in most cases). The question of whether the models matter and the time used to calculate the mean during training were discussed. It was suggested that mean cepstral subtraction could be viewed as a filtering process, specifically a high-pass or band-pass filter, and that designing a filter directly might be more effective than simply subtracting the mean. The use of silence regions in mean calculation was also raised as a point for further investigation.",
    "The discussion covered several topics. There was discussion of mixed signals regarding the VAD, with ideas for improvements including using known sections of nonspeech for estimation. The VAD results were used in tandem with another network to estimate phone probabilities, improving insertion errors.\n\nPostdoc A mentioned new headphones were purchased because of low gain in the originals. The team discussed alternative methods to increase disk space, considering Sonali's computer, internal disks on new machines, and the possibility of archiving successfully bleeped files.\n\nFinally, Adam set the deadline for reviewing the email and pages that were sent out for July 15. The team discussed that it would be better to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying \"by the way, we wanna hear back from you by X date and please,\" and then add what Liz said \"please, indicate you received this mail.\" The deadline was set so that the team has time to make changes if deletions are requested.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, special schools do not explicitly feature in the new purpose arrangement. However, the discussion around looked-after children and PDG provides some context.\n\nThe role of schools with PDG for looked-after children is to strategically deploy resources, either through direct support for individual children or capacity building for the entire system. This may involve training teachers on issues like attachment disorder. Regional consortia play a role in monitoring how these resources are used and ensuring accountability. The ultimate aim is to improve outcomes for vulnerable learners, but the evidence suggests there is room for improvement in this area.\n\nThe regional consortia are responsible for challenging and supporting schools on their use of PDG, ensuring that there is an evidence base for interventions. The new PDG regional advisors are expected to play a crucial role in ensuring consistent practice across the regions.",
    "The prototype remote control was introduced by the Industrial Designer, who presented initial ideas on its construction. The designer suggested defining necessary hardware components, surveying the market for affordable options, and building a prototype with the technical team to address communication issues. A battery-powered design with infrared communication was proposed, utilizing an FPGA chip for functionalities.\n\nThe Project Manager discussed making the remote control universal, suggesting it be compatible with any TV. The User Interface designer emphasized the need for minimal and strategically placed buttons, while the Marketing representative suggested speech recognition for ease of use, though this would increase the cost.\n",
    "During the meetings, the Industrial Designer focused on several key aspects of the prototype's design and user experience.\n\n**Appearance and Structure:** The Industrial Designer commented on the remote control's curvature, suggesting that a side curve would make it thin at the bottom and thicker at the top to accommodate the screen and batteries. They also highlighted the importance of the scroll button for navigation and accessing menus.\n\n**Customer Preferences:** The Industrial Designer emphasized the need for easy-to-find buttons, especially for older users, and proposed a separate button for teletext.

Chrystia Freeland's Perspective on Systemic Racism:** Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges that anti-black racism is real in Canada and that unconscious bias and systemic discrimination exist. She also mentions that the government is working to uphold the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and ensure the human rights of everyone in Canada are protected. Furthermore, she notes that at the federal level, RCMP members are guided by bias-free policing based on equality and non-discrimination.\n",
    "The segmenter has seen great progress recently. Specifically, a new version of the presegmentation has been created. This new version does channel-specific speech/non-speech detection using normalized features. The features are normalized energy, loudness, and modified loudness. The goal of the normalized features is to distinguish between foreground and background speech in each channel. The segmenter has been tested on 3-4 meetings and seems to work fairly well. A problem exists when a speaker doesn't talk much or at all in a given channel. In this instance, there are normalization problems that keep the system from working. The evaluation of the system is difficult as there are no references. There is a desire to have manual transcriptions for references.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the User Interface (UI) and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price due to differing views on the components. The Industrial Designer believed the components were cheap, while the UI designer considered the cost of programming the menus.\n\nThe UI designer did not agree on the redesign after the product evaluation because of the simple technology and the budget that was allowed.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as basic colors because yellow was one of the company colors, and red was used on the apple button.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the UI designer on the shape of the product because they believed a yellow color was not aimed at all customers.",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil, all representing ColegauCymru, expressed concerns regarding the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment. \n\nEvans stated employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac's meaning and content, suggesting the name \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" is more helpful. Brazil added that employers rarely request the Welsh bac from potential employees, focusing instead on professional qualifications and skills. He questioned whether the demanding nature and bureaucracy of the Welsh bac develops the skills employers need.\n\nMartin echoed these concerns, stating employers prioritize specific qualifications relevant to the job, alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. She noted that while the Welsh bac can help prepare learners for employment, especially A-level students for university, it's not suitable for everyone, particularly those needing to focus on core skills.",
    "The team presented and discussed several ideas and designs for the remote control's function and working design. The industrial designer presented an idea to define the hardware components needed and to build a prototype. The user interface designer suggested that the processing should be done on the TV set rather than the remote controller. The team discussed the idea of adding a speech interface to the remote. Other ideas included making the remote less expensive, giving it the flexibility of choosing languages, and giving it the ability to access the internet. \n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager had the following thoughts on the new remote control:\n\n*   **Market Range:** They were concerned about the target market and whether the remote should focus solely on television or extend to recording devices.\n*   **Price Issues:** The target price of twelve Euro fifty cents was a major constraint, influencing feature choices and materials.\n*   **Target Groups:** They aimed for younger customers (below 40) who like trendy designs but also value reliability. They initially considered the 20-40 age group with disposable income but later acknowledged the importance of targeting the 15-35 demographic.\n*   **New Features:** They were open to new features like speech recognition and glow-in-the-dark, but cautious about complexity and cost. They were wary of features that might not be used or could increase the price.\n*   **Feasibility of Multipurpose Remote Control:** They were interested in exploring a universal remote control concept but within the given cost constraints. They aimed for a balance between functionality and affordability.\n*   **Cost Constraints and Financial Targets:** The Project Manager emphasized the need to make a profit of fifty million Euros, highlighting the importance of cost-effective design and production.\n*   **Necessity of Setting the Selling Target:** They stressed the importance of understanding the competition, market potential, and customer preferences before finalizing the project and setting a selling target.\n*   **Target Market Group:** They expressed interest in the younger generation, but emphasized the need to balance trendy designs with reliability. They considered the importance of mobile phone trends for younger users.\n\n",
    "User Interface's (UI) perspective on cost constraints, financial targets, and kinetic battery replacement in the new remote control project was multifaceted. Regarding cost, UI emphasized the need to meet the 12.5 Euro target, agreeing to remove the LCD screen and speech recognition to save money. They were willing to consider replacing the rubber material with plastic to reduce expenses. UI questioned the necessity of solar cells given the recharging base station. UI seemed open to removing the turbo button if budget constraints required it. They were also receptive to eliminating the integrated scroll wheel push buttons in favor of a turbo button to reduce costs. UI advocated for a focus group with the target demographic to get real world feedback on the design.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements on several aspects of the product ideas. The Industrial Designer favored kinetic energy for its high-tech appeal and cost-effectiveness, while Marketing was concerned about the user experience, questioning if users would need to shake the remote when the power was low. They also explored solar panels, but the Industrial Designer noted space limitations for the interface.\n\nRegarding product features, the Industrial Designer focused on innovative elements like upgradability and advanced technology, while Marketing was more concerned with cost, marketability, and consumer demand.

    "HEFCW representatives acknowledged the financial challenges facing Welsh universities, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty, demographic dips, and funding gaps compared to England. The primary concern was the potential impact on the HE system's ability to deliver for Wales, particularly regarding research, skills development, and overall economic contribution.\n\nDiscussions revolved around the decline in EU student applications, with concerns about the long-term effects on the richness of the curriculum and student experience. HEFCW monitored the financial health of institutions, emphasizing the importance of prudent financial planning, estates strategies, and governance oversight. They assessed institutional risk through forecasts and regular meetings, intervening when necessary to protect student interests. While HEFCW aimed for a consistent minimum set of governance expectations, they recognized the autonomy of universities and the importance of fostering constructive challenge within governing bodies. Structural changes and closures were not anticipated, but the potential for cost-cutting measures remained a concern.",
    "The marketing strategy focuses on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly remote control. Market research indicated consumers are willing to pay more for a good-looking remote, even if it means a higher price point around 25 Euros. The design will emphasize essential functions, avoiding unnecessary complexity, as users typically utilize only a small percentage of buttons. The design team will focus on the age group of 15 to 35-year-olds, who are likely to purchase the TV.\n\nTo enhance sales and profits, the remote will be designed to be easy to operate, with a proper manual included. Features like speech recognition and glow-in-the-dark material are being considered to help users locate the remote.
