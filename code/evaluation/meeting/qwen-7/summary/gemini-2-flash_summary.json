    "The group decided that changes were needed in data collection. One suggestion was to use CrossPads, if Professor Landay could provide them, to capture handwritten notes alongside speech data. Another change was to take digital pictures of the table and boards to capture the context of the meeting. Additionally, the group agreed to ask participants to share something interesting they learned during the meeting to get varied responses. Finally, those willing were encouraged to provide oral summaries after the meeting.\n\nProfessor D's opinion was that it is important to start collecting data and send it to IBM for transcription, even with potential flaws. He believed that having cooperative participants generate queries could give Landay an idea of the kind of things people might want to know. He also emphasized the importance of understanding the people dynamics in the meetings.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models within their belief-net framework. They aimed to define what aspects of each model influenced user decisions, particularly concerning whether a user would \"go there\" (to a location).\n\nThey explored using user budget as a factor, differentiating it from overall user finance. User finance was considered a general tendency (cheap, average, spendy), while the budget represented the user's current spending money. They considered how to represent a changing budget within the belief-net, recognizing it would need external updating.\n\nThe group also talked about how to determine what information to draw from different models, including the discourse, to make a final decision. The group also discussed different ways to combine these factors, including a voting system, weighted averages, and a mixture of experts.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts contain limited direct discussion on the uncertainty of the Canadian economy during the special period. However, there is some discussion of the uncertainty of the Canadian economy. Cathy McLeod stated that Canada's economy was in trouble prior to the COVID. Mona Fortier acknowledged the Canadian economy was going through a period of extraordinary uncertainty due to COVID-19. \n\nCathy McLeod criticizes the government for refusing to provide an economic update and accuses them of simply having a question-but-no-answer period. She also points out the forestry industry was in crisis even before the pandemic. Mona Fortier stated that the government was open and transparent about the measures they've put in place for Canadians, workers, and businesses.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie's opinion was not included in the meeting transcripts.\n",
    "The industrial manager, in a team-building exercise, expressed his favorite animal was a cow and described characteristics that could translate into product design considerations. He mentioned that cows \"just keep sitting there eating grass\" and \"do not disturb anybody\" adding that they're \"kind of Buddhist in a way\". He seemed to admire their simplicity and non-intrusive nature. This suggests the manager values a product design that is straightforward, user-friendly, and doesn't disrupt or complicate the user's experience. The cow's passive and peaceful existence implies a desire for a product that is reliable, unobtrusive, and seamlessly integrates into the user's environment.\n",
    "The team used Transcriber, a tool with a Tcl-TK user interface, for converting audio to text. A post-doc is using the tool, and has been using token frequency lists to spell check, find inconsistencies and misspellings. The team also discussed Cyber Transcriber, a transcription service that provides a first-pass speech recognition, but noted that it would cost $300/hour. The team is interested in improving the Transcriber interface and tools, and discussed options such as incorporating a delay to account for the lag between hearing the audio and pressing the return key to mark the boundary, and automatic speaker identification. The team also mentioned some possible improvements such as foot pedals, and other analog controls. \n",
    "The presentations covered various aspects of designing a remote control. The user interface designer focused on creating a sellable and attractive interface with features like on/off, channel selection, volume control, subtitles, and picture adjustments. They also suggested voice recognition and child-friendly designs. The industrial designer concentrated on components, including a durable case, coloring components, a sophisticated chip resistant to temperature variations, resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, resonators, and potentially a rechargeable battery. They explained the functionality of buttons and the transmission of infrared signals. The marketing expert emphasized understanding the competition and differentiating their product, focusing on user-friendliness, fewer buttons, and a modern appearance. They also explored incorporating speech recognition and considered market trends like soft-feel materials. The team discussed potential features like a tracking device and the importance of a visually appealing design.",
    "The early implementer areas, also known as pioneer schools or innovation schools, were key to the curriculum's development and refinement. Feedback from the 16 innovation schools was invaluable in making the curriculum workable for all schools. They tested the curriculum's guidance, identified issues, and addressed assessment. The innovation schools worked with the Welsh government to refine the content, assessment, and accountability measures. The schools were chosen because of their ability to implement the curriculum in the round, and the group included a mix of primary and secondary schools, as well as English and Welsh medium schools. Each school in the innovation schools program received \u00a330,000.",
    "The Project Manager had mixed feelings about the product's features. They were initially enthusiastic about speech recognition, considering it a special feature for marketing. However, due to cost constraints, the Project Manager later proposed scrapping speech recognition altogether.\n\nRegarding technology, the Project Manager was open to incorporating an LCD but was willing to forgo it to stay within budget. They emphasized the importance of push buttons over scrolling methods due to cost considerations.\n\nOn design aspects, the Project Manager liked the raised buttons and the prominent placement of the on-off button. They also stressed the need for clear symbols on the buttons for international markets. While they appreciated the initial design with special colors and a curved form, they were ultimately willing to compromise on these aspects to meet the budget, suggesting a basic black remote with customizable covers.\n",
    "The team discussed recording conventions and incorporating video recordings. There was a desire to standardize the microphones used for recording to improve the quality and consistency of the audio data. One participant suggested that they may want to look at meetings to get some meetings where there's a little bit of heated discussion, like arguments and or emotion, and things like that.\n\nRegarding video, there was interest in capturing video recordings of the meetings, but concerns were raised about the human subjects issues and the potential for people not wanting to be videotaped. The team also acknowledged the infrastructure challenges associated with storing and managing video data. One participant expressed that NIST or LDC is in much better shape to do all that.\n\nUltimately, the team decided to prioritize audio quality and data collection efforts. The team agreed to keep the CrossPads but said if they are not using them to return one. They also agreed to bring the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine.\n",
    "The discussion of project finance revealed significant cost constraints, leading to several design changes. The initial design included an LCD screen and advanced chip, but these were removed to reduce costs. The titanium casing was also considered for replacement with a titanium-colored plastic to save money. The team debated the necessity of certain features and materials, with the goal of achieving a trendy design within budget.\n\nRegarding the drawing board, opinions were mixed. Some felt it was a disaster, while others saw potential if it functioned correctly. The digital pens were considered clunky and not particularly useful for note-taking, as the notes still needed to be transferred to a word processor. However, the pens might be useful for sketching, especially for those who sketch frequently. There were also complaints about the expense of the paper used with the drawing board. The team suggested that the ability to email and communicate between meetings would have been helpful.",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer focused on the aesthetic and functional aspects of the remote control, considering factors like shape, color, and materials. They explored various design options, including the \"squishy fruitiness\" concept, and assessed the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of different features. The Project Manager, on the other hand, was primarily concerned with ensuring the project stayed within budget and met the specified requirements. They frequently inquired about costs, dimensions, and functionality, seeking to gather all necessary details for the final report.\n\nFrom the team presentations and evaluations, the Project Manager drew the conclusion that the remote control design was satisfactory and trendy. However, they noted that the comfort and usability of the design needed improvement and that they were slightly disappointed about not being able to use plastic and rubber. They also observed that the team agreed that the product fit the budget.\n",
    "The team initially considered a charging base for the remote but ultimately decided against it, favoring a smaller, more compact design with batteries. This decision was influenced by current trends favoring smaller electronics and a desire to create a more advanced product with a locating device.\n\nFashionability was a key consideration, with the team initially exploring current trends like fruit and vegetable patterns and spongy materials. However, they expressed concerns about these trends being short-lived and potentially conflicting with the product's longevity. They also discussed different materials for the remote's casing, including titanium, plastic, and latex, weighing the cost and aesthetic implications of each option.\n\nThe team referenced existing remotes like those for the iPod to discuss menu navigation and button placement. They considered scroll wheels versus pushbuttons, debating the pros and cons of each in terms of functionality, cost, and aesthetics. The team also discussed the trade-offs between having a simple, easy-to-use remote versus incorporating more advanced features like voice recognition.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of designing an environmentally-friendly remote control. They considered using spongy material, drawing inspiration from the current trend of fruits and vegetables, and exploring potential materials like plastic, rubber, and titanium. The group decided to not use titanium due to not bending to curves.\n\nThe discussion touched upon incorporating a small LCD screen to display program information, accessible through a scroll button, but this idea was ultimately rejected due to cost and coherence with the desired simplicity and sturdiness of the remote. They also discussed the button sizes and potential layouts, including round or square shapes and a two-tone color scheme. \n\nThe group also touched upon the creation of a questionnaire to help with the remote design.\n",
    "During the meetings, the Project Manager introduced a remote control prototype, emphasizing that the materials used were not exactly as intended. The User Interface designer highlighted the gunmetal gray base and the feature of all buttons lighting up when any button is pressed. The Industrial Designer described the curvature, button placement (with less-used buttons squared), and black labeling.\n\nThe group discussed evaluation criteria, including ease of use and fashion. They considered whether the product felt good physically and if it was technologically innovative, including voice recognition capabilities. There were lower grades given in the technological aspect because the prototype lacked voice control and didn't cover devices beyond TVs.\n\nThe Marketing representative presented that a tracking device would be a good idea, due to the frustration of lost remotes. Consideration was given to a locator function to address user frustration about misplaced remotes, aligning with functional requirements. The team also explored the possibility of speech recognition and the importance of the appearance of the remote.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C are discussing how to work together on the speaker overlap project. PhD C did a lot of manual marking of overlapped zones and pure speech zones to classify speech and overlapping speech. Due to time constraints and the study being in its early stages, PhD C limited the study and excluded nonspeech sounds. PhD A asked about it and PhD C stated he wanted to limit the amount of study. The discussion included various technical aspects, classification, what parameters to use, the kind of signal, and what is needed for the first step of the process. A problem with overlaps is that the variation of duration is very big on the data.\n\nThe group faced several problems and difficulties due to the number of overlaps. Another difficulty is that the energy behavior is not the same all the time. They were also dealing with a range of overlapping zones. It was decided to start with raw energy. There were also difficulties due to overlaps across the minute boundaries.",
    "The discussion on latency primarily revolved around the transcription process. The group was experiencing delays in receiving transcriptions from IBM, with a turnaround time of a week or more for tapes sent to them. This was causing bottlenecks, as transcribers hired by Jane were sometimes idle, awaiting data.\n\nProfessor B expressed concern about the \"liveness\" of the demos and the desire to show that the team could actually get prosodic information and see it. The professor wanted a transcriber interface that could display some other interesting signal along with it. The professor acknowledged that they may have to retreat to some extent due to time constraints.",
    "The User Interface designer introduced a prototype with several key features and advantages. The prototype focused on modularity, allowing users to customize the remote with features like an LCD screen, speech recognition, or parental controls, paying only for the functions they wanted. \n\nThe design emphasized simplicity and power, aiming to provide a few buttons with extensive functionality. A single button with 360-degree movement acted as a joystick for navigation. Additional features included a robust titanium material, long battery life, a misplacement reminder, programmable channels and vocabulary, and TV program retrieval by genre.\n\nThe designer highlighted that even with fewer buttons, the remote would retain powerful functionalities. This approach aimed to balance simplicity with advanced features, catering to a wide range of users while keeping costs down.\n",
    "The prototype model presentation showcased a snowman-shaped remote control. The initial design included no LCD display, kinetic and battery power, rubber buttons with internal LED backlighting, a jog-dial, and a slogan. However, due to cost constraints, the prototype was altered.\n\nThe first version included an LCD screen with menu access via a scroll wheel and confirm button. It maintained a foggy yellow color scheme that lit up upon button presses. A prominent red button served as both the power button (when held) and a confirm button for the LCD screen. The jog-dial controlled volume and advanced functions like contrast and brightness. A slogan was to be placed on the side or bottom.\n\nThe second, cost-reduced version eliminated the LCD panel and advanced chip. The team decided that on-screen TV feedback would suffice. It retained the button grid layout. The design team discussed dimensions, aiming for a comfortable, palm-sized device. They also considered button shape and logo placement.\n",
    "The group discussed various design aspects of the new remote control, keeping a close eye on the budget of twelve Euro fifty cents. Initially, they considered a touch screen and flip screens for advanced functionalities, but these were deemed too expensive. The flip-top design was explored for its potential to house additional buttons or features, but concerns were raised about the increased cost and complexity.\n\nBattery life was a key concern, with discussions revolving around whether to use a standard battery or explore kinetic energy as an alternative power source. Ultimately, they opted for a standard battery to reduce costs. They decided to remove the LCD screen and speech recognition to cut costs, which caused marketing to express concerns about whether they could make the product attractive to the target demographic.\n",
    "From the meeting transcripts, the Welsh Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda. Key takeaways include:\n\n*   **Importance of strong, capable school leadership:** Recognizing leadership as a driver for change.\n*   **Comprehensive tracking and processes:** Implementing effective systems for tracking student progress within schools.\n*   **Teacher quality:** Ensuring consistent strategies are in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom.\n*   **Collaborative activity:** Promoting a self-improving system where schools learn from each other and share best practices.\n\nThe Government is embedding these lessons into the regional consortia. The improvement boards are staying on, and the schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. If a school is in the \"red\" category, it gives them entitlement to 25 days of support, which is more than they would have gotten under the Schools Challenge Cymru program, which would have been 20 days.",
    "Dr. David Blaney acknowledges a decrease in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, contrasting with an increase in England. He attributes this to two main factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students (who now have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as Welsh students) and the state of repair of campuses. He suggests that the perception of better-invested systems in England, with superior facilities and infrastructure, makes them more attractive to prospective students.\n\nWhen asked about why prospective students should choose to study in Wales, he suggests that one of the particular messages is relative safety. He indicates that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. He notes that Wales has a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the mental spaces contain domains related to the tourist domain and child language learning. There is a suggestion to add a \"what's this?\" domain.\n\nThe middle layer would function as a cognitive dispatcher, which decides how to fill out missing parts of complex object trees. It would determine what each module can do, collect sub-objects, and recombine them. This layer would take the normal M-three-L, look up more stuff in the ontology, and ask the real world. It will also look up dialogue history. The middle layer will receive a vector, and then the cognitive dispatcher will turn a crank in the belief-net, and that will come out with another vector, which can then be applied at the simulation or action end.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the professor's thoughts on the back-end and data storage seemed to revolve around practical considerations and a desire for a system that meets the project's needs without being overly burdensome.\n\nThe professor emphasized the importance of getting data transcribed and exploring potential queries to drive the system's development. They acknowledge the need to get started somewhere, even if the initial system is imperfect. They seemed open to various approaches for generating summaries and queries, including manual methods and leveraging existing resources.\n\nThe professor also highlighted the need to balance data collection with practical considerations, such as storage space and the effort required to process the data. They are interested in exploring different types of data and data collection methods but also emphasize the importance of keeping things manageable.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts cover a wide range of topics. The seniors care crisis was discussed in the context of the disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes and appalling conditions witnessed by the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nSystemic racism was addressed, acknowledging its presence in Canadian institutions, particularly in the RCMP and justice system.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were mentioned, specifically concerning access to programs like the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay expressed openness to public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families, emphasizing the need for appropriate compensation.\n\nThe Minister of Seniors did not make any statements on pandemic assistance for seniors.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer experienced disagreements regarding the remote control design due to differing priorities and perspectives. Marketing focused on the \"sizzle,\" aiming for an attractive, impulse purchase at a low price point, emphasizing simplicity and ease of use. The Industrial Designer was interested in features, shapes, colors, and technical feasibility, such as universal compatibility and button functionality, while also considering budget constraints. The Project Manager had to balance these desires with higher management's instructions, corporate image, and budget limitations, sometimes leading to the elimination of features that Marketing or the Industrial Designer found appealing. These conflicting goals and constraints naturally led to disagreements as each party advocated for their priorities.\n",
    "During the meetings, Marketing designed the product evaluation with a focus on gauging the team's response to a set of questions aimed at assessing the product's viability and appeal. The evaluation criteria included:\n\n*   **Ease of Use:** Determining how user-friendly the remote is for the average consumer.\n*   **Fashionable:** Assessing its appeal as a fashion accessory.\n*   **Feel Good:** Evaluating the comfort and tactile experience of holding the device.\n*   **Technologically Innovative:** Measuring its advancement compared to existing remotes.\n*   **Squishy and Fruity:** Gauging the product's trendiness and market appeal.\n\nMarketing also considered factors like the remote's size, functionality, and potential for market success, emphasizing the importance of visual appeal and tactile experience in attracting customers. The evaluation process involved presenting a prototype to consumer research groups to gather feedback and identify any potential issues before mass production.",
    "The transcription status is that the transcribers are nearing completion of their tasks. The current process involves transcribers providing a single-channel transcript, which is then channelized. To improve accuracy, the team is working on refining time markings on a per-channel basis.\n\nFor recordings, the team is exploring options for managing disk space, including downsampling and compression. It was decided that the original recordings should be kept in their original form, without downsampling, for future research purposes.\n\nIntermediate categories are being standardized. There is a focus on standardizing spoken forms, acronyms, and comments, with a goal of creating a master transcript that can be used for various purposes, including ASR and discourse analysis. Efforts are being made to differentiate between different types of \"NUMS\" tags (numbers) and to improve the robustness of the transcript format.",
    "In the meetings, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness by stating that her amendments would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law. She did not think amendments made by others added anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister stated that her amendment was influenced by a committee recommendation. She said that the post-implementation review would not be a single piece of work but a continuous program. She stated that another amendment was unnecessary and conflicted with the priority of implementing the Bill.\n\nOn regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister said the amendments were technical. She brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill. She did not think it was necessary to have wider powers but assured the committee that she would keep that in review coming up to Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion on long-term trends in raising standards and improving educational attainment highlighted the difficulty of comparing data due to changing performance measures. While these changes are made to benefit learners, they create challenges in tracking progress. The Minister and her team use a range of data, including the school categorization system, Estyn reports, and examination results, to gain a broader picture of educational performance. They also emphasize the importance of intelligent use and interrogation of data, rather than relying on single indicators.\n\nPhilip Blaker, from Qualification Wales, stated that Qualifications Wales is responsible for approving specifications and sample assessment materials, maintaining standards, and ensuring fair awards of qualifications. During periods of change, comparable outcomes are prescribed to ensure fairness across cohorts. He also mentioned the role of Welsh Government in grant funding for the translation of materials and the reliance on commercial publishers for textbooks.\n\nThe transcripts do not include any discussion of timescales for addressing the lack of exams.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted significant challenges in implementing consistent practices across Wales, particularly concerning childcare services. A primary concern is the historical focus on getting parents into work, potentially overshadowing early child development needs. The current system is seen as complex and needing simplification, especially regarding funding and the transition from early childhood to school.\n\nVariations in early childhood education and care provision across different regions of Wales, influenced by local authority decisions and historical factors, create inconsistencies. The Welsh Government intends to address these disparities, testing consistent funding rates in pilot areas and working with local authorities to develop facilities that meet local needs. However, concerns remain about potential funding cuts impacting the quality of the foundation phase and the need for a more universal approach to childcare availability.\n",
    "The discussion covered several aspects of component availability. For the casing, materials like metal, rubber, plastic, titanium, and wood were considered. Rubber was favored for its anti-RSI properties and aesthetic choices, while wood was considered for its environmentally friendly nature. The shape of the case (curved vs. flat) was discussed, with emphasis on ergonomics.\n\nFor internal components, the discussion included circuit boards with diodes, transistors, resonators, resistors, and capacitors. Different chip options (simple, regular, advanced) were considered. Power sources like basic batteries, hand-powered dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar power were weighed.\n\nRegarding the user interface, the team leaned towards a command interface with numbers and symbols for volume and display. Multiple option scroll buttons and integrated pushbuttons were considered. An LCD screen was discussed but potentially deemed too expensive. The team also considered button color and lighting effects.",
    "The professor expressed concern about the final model, noting that an air conditioner's energy at 5 hertz was prominently featured in waveforms, which was not ideal for illustrating room reverberation. He suggested a simple digital filter to address this. The discussion also touched on the use of a high-pass filter option in Feacalc, typically used to mitigate such issues, with a mild effect up to 100 hertz.\n\nOn the topic of reverberation, the professor wanted to improve the visual demonstration on the web page by either magnifying a piece of the spectrogram or using spectral slices to highlight the differences caused by reverberation. One of the members suggested using MFCC feature vectors. He noted that the spectrograms don't show as bad because the brain is good at picking out patterns.\n\nRegarding pronouncing \"zero,\" the professor indicated that in digit recognition, there are two pronunciations for the digit zero: \"O\" and \"zero.\" The professor mentioned when talking on the phone, he almost always says \"zero,\" while some people say \"O.\"\n",
    "The group discussed the concept for a new remote control, focusing on key features and design elements.\n\n*   **Universal Remote:** The remote should be universal, compatible with TVs, cable boxes, VCRs, DVDs, and audio systems.\n*   **Parental Control:** The parental control feature, which allows parents to restrict content based on channels or time, was debated, with concerns raised about its complexity and cost, but ultimately decided to be included as an optional feature.\n*   **Voice Recognition:** The team explored voice recognition, with the user interface designer advocating for its inclusion as a selling point. However, the industrial designer expressed doubts about its reliability and cost.\n*   **Games:** The team decided against games.\n*   **Physical Design:** The team leaned toward a double-curved, rubber case in a flashy, fruity color with removable covers. A touch screen was considered, and kinetic energy was favored as a backup power source alongside batteries.\n*   **Buttons:** The team decided to simplify the remote by using a menu structure and keeping the number of buttons to a minimum.",
    "During the meetings, the group discussed the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, especially concerning suicide rates among children and young people. Vaughan Gething mentioned commissioning a review, conducted by the delivery unit in collaboration with the national advisory group, to assess unexpected deaths during the pandemic's onset, aiming to determine if there was a spike in suicides due to restrictions. A report was expected by the end of the month, which would then be shared with the committee.\n\nGething also elaborated on perinatal mental health support for pregnant women. The goal was to maintain consistent support across Wales during this challenging period, with a focus on remote delivery via phone or online. He acknowledged concerns about decreased willingness to use mother and baby unit provisions due to fear and lockdown, but emphasized the commitment to in-patient capacity and staff dedication to service delivery.\n",
    "The implementation work on the new curriculum is expected to be finished by January 2020, with the final version being published at that time. The group overseeing the curriculum is very clear about establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other. The group does not believe there is a risk of losing focus in that sense.\n\nRegarding improvements that present more of a challenge, there is a push to ensure that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took.\n\nNetworking within the PRU and transition arrangements were also discussed. The intention is to set a minimum of what would be expected for a child to receive. That would be around the four purposes, that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. After that, there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil.\n",
    "During the discussion of general requirements, the group had varying opinions on infra-red functionality and disposable income.\n\nRegarding infra-red, the Industrial Designer suggested it was the best way to project information to the receiver because it doesn't need a sight line. However, they also noted that if the remote is held while someone is talking to it (for voice recognition), the line of sight could be blocked. The Project Manager thought that it was tried and tested, so they could stick with that.\n\nIn terms of disposable income, the group considered targeting a younger demographic (15-35 years old) because they believed this group had more disposable income to spend on technology. This was also the demographic that showed the most interest in voice recognition, a feature the group was considering. However, it was also noted that people in that age group may be less likely to own a television.\n",
    "The group holds mixed opinions on using eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as a measure. One member suggests it is the best measure in the absence of anything better, while recognizing its limitations. Some believe it acceptable in the spirit of the grant, despite some blurring of eligibility.\n\nRegarding the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, members note that Estyn has reported improvements in attendance. They highlight examples of schools using PDG funding for initiatives like \"walking buses\" and employing staff to work directly with families to improve attendance and engagement. Despite improvements, a gap remains between the attendance of FSM and non-FSM pupils, indicating more work is needed. The effectiveness of these interventions is considered challenging to measure, and opinions on their impact vary.",
    "Professor C. expressed interest in PhD D's voiced-unvoiced detection work, suggesting using R-one over R-zero for spectral slope, as it helps determine if the spectrum looks like voiced or unvoiced sounds.\n\nLater in the meetings, Grad A mentioned using support vector machines for classification and compared them to recurrent neural networks. Professor C. explained that support vector machines are succinct and can do a reasonable job with less data by picking out representative examples, unlike neural nets or Gaussian mixtures which require a lot of parameters. It was also mentioned that Mississippi State used support vector machines for speech recognition and estimated probabilities.\n",
    "The professor believes echoes, reverberation, and other acoustic events are important to study and remove from speech. They mention echo cancellation to handle far-field effects, which can be applied by using block echo cancellation with digits. They also mention that there was a party line idea that echo cancellation was not the right way to handle the situation. They suggest using feature approaches and multi-stream approaches. The professor notes that they are interested in distant mikes and suggests adding an extra channel to radio shows to capture more distant sound.\n",
    "The team discussed the user interface (UI) design of the remote control, focusing on simplicity and user-friendliness. Based on marketing research, they noted that most users find existing remote controls too complex, using only a small percentage of the buttons. As a result, they decided to prioritize a simple design with fewer buttons, primarily focusing on essential functions like channel, volume, power on/off, and mute.\n\nAdditional considerations included a way to easily find the remote when lost, possibly through a back-lit wheel for the buttons. The team also explored the idea of tactile buttons, potentially embossed or shaped like numbers, to enhance usability for a broader audience. They ruled out an LCD screen due to the desire for simplicity and to avoid delaying the development process. Voice recognition was also dismissed for the same reason. Ultimately, the team aimed for a user-friendly design that incorporates the company logo and colors for brand recognition.\n",
    "During the product evaluation and discussion of product requirements, the project manager had specific thoughts on the design elements.\n\nRegarding the plastic material, the project manager did not express any concerns. For the changeable cover, the project manager seemed to be on board with the concept and the idea of it being a fashion accessory. The project manager initially questioned how people would put the remote down, wondering if it would be vertical, but was open to the idea of broadening the base to allow it to stand.\n\nThe project manager did not have strong feelings about the color. As for the shape, the project manager liked the basic concept and that it looked different.\n",
    "The discussion on fixing the system and improving the baseline centered around several key areas. The national evaluation and improvement resource was highlighted as a critical tool for fostering robust self-evaluation within schools, a skill previously identified as underdeveloped in the Welsh education system. The resource is currently in the testing phase, with plans for system-wide introduction in September 2020.\n\nThe discussion also addressed the need for early identification and intervention in struggling schools. The Chief Inspector's report indicated that schools needing special measures weren't being identified early enough, leading to a multi-agency approach involving schools, local authorities, regional consortia, Estyn, and the Welsh Government. This approach aims to provide comprehensive support and ensure sustainable improvement, addressing underlying issues rather than just focusing on short-term gains. Finally, the committee explored the effectiveness of investment in school standards, with a significant portion of resources directed towards professional learning for teachers.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts cover a range of topics, including discussions and petitions related to:\n\n*   **Legislation:** Bill S-204 concerning organ harvesting and trafficking, Bill C-7 regarding euthanasia, and a \"Green New Deal\" motion (M-1).\n*   **Sports Infrastructural Construction:** Discussions on safe and regulated sports betting.\n*   **Government Support for Energy Resources:** Concerns raised about delays in financial support for the energy sector, specifically regarding the EDC, BDC, and LEEFF programs.\n*   **Tourism:** Discussions of the tourism industry, the financial losses due to COVID-19, and the need for direct support.\n*   **Funding in Green Economy and Small Businesses:** Discussions on the green shift, and funding for small businesses.\n*   **Impact of Covid-19:** The effect of the pandemic on sectors like fishing, tourism, oil, and gas.\n    *   **Fishing:** Discussions of support programs for harvesters.\n    *   **Tourism:** Discussions of financial losses due to COVID-19 and the need for direct support.\n    *   **Oil and Gas:** Concerns raised about delays in financial support for the energy sector.",
    "The team initially considered a ball shape for the remote, appreciating its stability. However, they acknowledged the rolling issue and the need for a flat side. There was also discussion around a flip-phone style design. The team agreed that the number of functions should be minimized for simplicity. The Industrial Designer expressed that current remotes are long rectangles, but the team agreed that they wanted something innovative.\n\nThe team decided to change the shape to a single-curved design to give it a more aesthetic feel. Personalization was discussed in the form of changeable covers, similar to mobile phones, to keep up with fashion trends, but the idea was deemed unfeasible due to the company logo placement. There was a brief consideration of a novel shape, like a fruit or vegetable, but it was deemed too trendy and potentially confusing for users. The final decision on the casing shape was a single-curved rubber case, to be more ergonomic.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed the idea of using fruit and vegetable themes, with bright colors like lemon or lime, for the product design. This was based on information from fashion watchers in Paris and Milan, who identified fruits, vegetables, and spongy materials as trendy themes for the year, particularly appealing to the younger market. The aim was to incorporate these elements, not necessarily as literal representations of fruits or vegetables, but through the use of round curves and catchy colors to create a visually appealing and trendy product.\n",
    "The overall conclusion from the meetings regarding the remote control is a move towards a minimalist design with a small joystick, an LCD screen, and minimal buttons. Market research indicates people want remote controls to look cool and be easy to use, with a preference for style over ease of use. Adjustments include considering ergonomics to minimize repetitive strain injury, potentially through voice recognition or a comfortable, ergonomic design. The remote will primarily target television functionality, excluding teletext, but may include interactive functions for digital or cable boxes. The design should incorporate the company logo and slogan, with exploration of features like a locator function to address common user issues. The final design should balance innovation, cost-effectiveness, and user preferences.\n",
    "The committee assessed the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 and the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. They also reviewed the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales.\n\nThe discussion on women's issues included the gender pay gap within institutions and diversity of governance, and the committee noted that men make up around 56% of membership of universities' governing bodies while women make up 44% of membership.\n\nThe committee's statements on housing are not mentioned in the meeting transcripts.\n\nThe members' discussions included whether the public is aware of the legislation, the implications of removing the defense of reasonable punishment, the need for a sustained awareness campaign, and concerns about a lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Members also discussed concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and financial impact.",
    "The discussion of \"meeting digits\" is brief. It starts with a roll call of the meeting attendees, with each person stating their name and channel number. There is also discussion about P D As, P Z As, and Jimlets, which are pieces of equipment being used in the meeting. The discussion highlights the challenge of capturing and understanding the technical jargon and shorthand used within the group, and the need to define these terms for a broader audience who may not be familiar with them. Overall, the initial discussion around \"meeting digits\" is centered on the basic logistics of the meeting, including identifying attendees, setting up equipment, and addressing the challenges of understanding the technical language used.",
    "The recommendation for a speech recognition interface stems from market research indicating high interest from the 15-35 age group, with 75-90% willing to pay for it.\n\nMarketing views speech recognition as a trendy, fancy feature that could differentiate the product and drive sales, especially if it's a simple, one-word command system for functions like \"louder,\" \"softer,\" \"change channel,\" \"on,\" \"off,\" or \"remote\" for locating the device.\n\nThe industrial designer believes speech recognition is possible if users are willing to spend time in a training process, potentially reducing overall costs.\n\nThe user interface designer acknowledges the appeal but raises concerns about ambient noise interference from TV and other speech. They emphasize the need for a speech recognizer capable of filtering out TV speech and accurately distinguishing user commands to avoid unintended actions.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not contain significant discussion on the work of consortia.\n\nBill Blair responded to the firearms seizure issue at Pearson airport by stating that it's important to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals. He also emphasized the government's commitment to strengthening gun control to keep Canadians safe. The transcripts do not specify measures proposed for ensuring social stability.\n\nThe Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic aims to address the health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The transcripts focus on the challenges presented by the pandemic, and the government\u2019s response.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the remote's functions. They considered implementing a \"lost-and-found\" feature, drawing inspiration from phone-finding technology, such as a beeping function activated from a base station or a whistle/clap-activated response from the remote.\n\nImprovements were discussed during project evaluation, focusing on simplifying the remote by reducing the number of buttons to those most frequently used (channel, volume, power). A menu button was proposed to access less frequently used settings like audio and screen adjustments. The team also agreed to incorporate the company's color scheme and slogan into the remote's design.\n\nBrainstorming for new functions included speech recognition, although concerns were raised about its cost, accuracy, and user acceptance across different age groups. The team also explored the idea of a two-piece remote, with a smaller, rounded piece for quick zapping and a larger piece for more complex functions.\n",
    "During the finance discussions, the group debated the cost implications of using special colors for the buttons. Marketing initially assumed only the red apple button would be a different color. However, the industrial designer separated volume and channel buttons by color, with volume in orange. The project manager noted that using multiple colors would impact costs, prompting a discussion about whether the colors were essential.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied with the changes because the initial design concept included specific colors to enhance the product's trendy look and feel. The shift towards standardizing button colors, driven by budget constraints, compromised the intended aesthetic and alignment with the company's marketing strategy. The need to cut costs led to a less visually appealing design, which Marketing felt undermined the product's overall marketability.\n",
    "The key points regarding the Welsh dimension focus on the need for a joint communication plan led by the government and Qualifications Wales. This plan should engage employers more effectively with the education system and communicate the value of the Welsh baccalaureate.\n\nRegarding employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, the meetings revealed a significant problem. Many employers do not understand or value the qualification, even though the skills it develops are desired in the workplace. To improve understanding, it was suggested that employers' voices be included in reviewing the qualification and that employability and entrepreneurial skills have a more prominent role. Connecting employers with schools and education facilities through social value contracts was also proposed.\n\nThe benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales were not directly discussed.",
    "The group held mixed opinions on the convenience of the presentation materials. The industrial designer and user interface designer both felt the PowerPoint slides were helpful in providing a structure. The marketing representative expressed dissatisfaction with the level of information provided, stating they didn't receive any information for the last presentation. The group agreed that the microphones and wires made it difficult to use the whiteboard and the digital pens were clunky and not very intuitive. The team felt that the shared computer was a distraction and they would have preferred to have one computer in the room.",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays for several reasons during their discussion of interface controls, scroll wheels, and remote concepts. The primary reason was cost. LCD screens require an advanced chip, which is more expensive than the simple or regular chips needed for pushbuttons or scroll wheels.\n\nAesthetics and practicality also played a role. The marketing representative stated that while fancy designs are important, ease of use is also a factor. The team discussed that an LCD screen might be small and require backlighting, and the product manager stated that an LCD screen on the remote would provide one-way communication. The team also considered the alternative of an on-screen display on the television. Ultimately, the team decided to go with pushbuttons to keep costs down.\n",
    "**Self-Introduction:** The team consisted of Shrida Daseri (project manager), Agnes (user interface designer), Ed (marketing), and Christine (industrial designer).\n\n**Project Introduction:** The project was to design a new TV remote control.

They discussed the impact of the room environment and equipment on their ability to brainstorm effectively. Teamwork was hindered by limited communication outside of meetings. The team found the whiteboard and digital pens useful, but the computers were distracting. The team also mentioned that the use of Play-Doh was helpful in the creative process.\n",
    "During the meeting, the industrial designer mentioned that there was no rechargeable option available for the remote control. They considered standard AA and AAA batteries as too bulky and dynamo charging as silly. The industrial designer suggested solar charging, since most people have the light on when watching TV. There was a discussion on whether artificial light would charge as sunlight does. Kinetic charging, like in wristwatches, was also discussed, with the idea that normal movement would charge the device. The user interface team member asked about the life of the kinetic battery, and the industrial designer said they had never seen one run out. The project manager questioned whether there would be enough movement to charge it. The marketing team member asked if solar charging was compatible with standard batteries, and the industrial designer thought there could be a dual power thing. The team also mentioned the importance of a long-lasting battery, so customers would not have to charge the remote control every day.\n",
    "The decision was to standardize the microphones used in the meetings to improve the quality and uniformity of the audio recordings. This was driven by the need to reduce variability in the recordings, which would benefit researchers working on dialogue, prosody, and speech recognition. It was also mentioned that transcribers had difficulty with the nonuniformity of the microphones. There was also a discussion about potentially using head-mounted microphones, as they provide better audio quality by reducing breath sounds and background noise. The group agreed to explore purchasing a set of identical microphones and to look into whether wireless options were available.\n",

Marketing mentioned the potential for repetitive strain injury.\n",
    "The lab tests revealed that users are generally unhappy with current remote controls, with 80% willing to spend more for a fancier design. Key findings included the need for a \"snazzy yet simple\" remote, as users only utilize about 10% of the buttons on existing models. Simplicity is crucial, as 34% find learning new remotes too time-consuming.\n\nThe group discussed including a \"homing device\" or finder function. The team explored voice-activated locators but recognized this would need a more substantial chip. The team also discussed the call button function as a way to find the remote.\n\nThe team considered larger buttons for ease of use, especially for an older demographic. The team wanted buttons that don't look like a normal remote. The team also discussed the possibility of a charger for the remote.\n\nRegarding lighting adaptive options, the team considered a yellow light for the keys or a yellow strip for the logo to incorporate the company color. The team also discussed if the buttons illuminated upon contact, they could illuminate yellow.\n",
    "The team held multiple meetings and discussed the topics of DAT, power cables, and capturing subject intention.\n\nDAT and Power Cables:\nThe team used DAT and power cables to record high-quality audio. There were concerns about the DAT crashing. They used a combination of table top microphones and close-talking microphones. The close-talking microphones were used to get ground truth and high-quality audio.\n\nCapturing Subject Intention:\nThe team explored methods for capturing subject intention. They discussed the idea of using a belief net to infer subject intention. They also discussed the importance of considering contextual factors, such as the time of day and the type of object being discussed. They wanted to differentiate between the Vista, Enter, and Tango modes.\n\nAnalysis Approaches:\nThe team considered several approaches for analyzing the data, including the use of word frequency counts and pilot experiments. They also discussed the possibility of using a belief net to infer subject intention. The team explored the use of existing tools, such as the SmartKom system, but found them to be too crude for capturing the nuances of intention. They also considered the use of FrameNet to come up with a nice little set of features and maybe even means of extracting them.\n",
    "The group discussed the general specifications and case design, focusing on balancing functionality, aesthetics, and cost. They decided to move forward with a lightweight plastic case and interchangeable rubbery covers, similar to iPod covers, to provide a spongy feel and protect the device. This decision was driven by the desire to meet the fashion trends and the need to stay within the budget.\n\nThe group explored the concept of changeable cases, deciding to make them easily removable and replaceable, enhancing the fashion accessory aspect of the remote.

Institutions are also focusing on promoting Wales to attract funding, and advocating to maintain access to the successor of Horizon 2020.\n\nThere is no mention of the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks or updates on projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada.\n",
    "The key points regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada are:\n\n*   **Long-Term Care Crisis:** The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed critical vulnerabilities in long-term care facilities across Canada, with a disproportionate number of deaths occurring in these facilities. Reports have detailed appalling conditions, neglect, abuse, and potential criminal conduct in some homes.\n\n*   **Jurisdictional Issues:** Long-term care falls under provincial jurisdiction, but there are calls for national standards of care, similar to the Canada Health Act, to ensure consistent and acceptable standards across the country. The federal government has expressed willingness to support provinces in addressing these issues.\n\n*   **Profit vs. Care:** There's a debate about the role of profit in long-term care, with concerns that for-profit models may prioritize the bottom line over the well-being of seniors. Calls are being made to remove profit from long-term care.\n\n*   **Federal Support:** The government has provided funding to provinces and territories to help them prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks and support seniors.\n\n",
    "The marketing expert believes that the remote should be small, easy to use, and eye-catching. Getting to market before the competition is a top priority. To achieve this, focusing on one or two key features for the marketing campaign is essential. The expert suggests that voice recognition would be a big selling point. The image, visual appeal, and the snail image should be utilized. The shape should be biomorphic, comfy, and round, with soft buttons. The expert emphasizes the importance of showing the prototype to various age and socioeconomic groups for feedback and consumer research, and also emphasizes that the price point must be appropriate for the market. ",
    "The meetings extensively discussed the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, focusing on universal adoption, advantages, and weaknesses.\n\n**Universal Adoption:**\nThe Welsh government emphasized its commitment to a high-intensity public awareness campaign, with an expert stakeholder group supporting its development. However, concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the campaign, especially in reaching harder-to-reach groups. The need for a sustained awareness campaign beyond the implementation of the Bill was highlighted.\n\n**Advantages:**\nThe Bill was seen as a natural progression of change in how children are cared for in Wales. It would bring clarity to children, parents, and professionals. It would improve the ability to protect children by making the law clear, as it removes a defense to an offense of common assault. It was seen as essential to protect children's rights and ensure they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. It will help to change people's attitudes, which may result in long term savings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nA key concern was the potential for unintended consequences, particularly an increase in workload for social services, and that it might have a disproportionate impact on specific groups, such as women, minority ethnic groups, and very young children. There were concerns about the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. It was argued that the Bill might not be effective without adequate resources and support for families. It was also noted that the Bill could lead to parents being criminalized, despite the intention to avoid this. There was concern that there was a lack of clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment.\n",
    "The group discussed evaluation criteria for a prototype remote control, focusing on user requirements and market trends.

    "Participants had differing views regarding CD's for backup. One participant mentioned that CD's wear out just from sitting on the shelf, while another noted the LDC distributions were on CD-ROM. One participant stated that they had disks that were gone in a year, while the average disk would last three or four years. They determined that for archiving, they would just use tape.\n\nThe discussion on probability computation involved using belief-nets. They discussed factors for tourist destinations, time of day, and conditional probabilities of wanting to view, enter, or tango with a destination. The current front-end doesn't provide enough information to determine intentions. They discussed extracting information from M-three-L structures and combining contextual, linguistic, and discourse elements, with the belief-net being a way to combine them.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system involved a person sitting in a room looking at a 3D model or QuickTime animation of Heidelberg. They were told that a wonderful computer system existed that could tell them everything they wanted to know and understood them completely. They would pick up a phone, dial a number, and solve a certain amount of tasks. After the third task, the system would crash, and a human operator would come on, apologize, and urge them to continue with the same tasks but different objects. The computer system knew exactly where they were via GPS, and they would tell the person where they were depending on what they saw.\n",
    "The team decided against symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote due to their design goals. They aimed for an ergonomic design that would stand out from other remotes on the market. The team wanted the remote to be comfortable, innovative, and different.\n\nRegarding the Project Manager's suggestion of creating a right- and left-handed remote, the team had mixed reactions. The user interface designer was initially supportive, but the marketing representative questioned the practicality of families needing two remotes. The industrial designer pointed out that many left-handed individuals adapt to right-handed devices like computer mice. Ultimately, while the team acknowledged the possibility of creating both versions, they didn't fully commit to it during the prototype presentation.\n",
    "The group discussed cost reduction strategies extensively. Initially, the prototype with all desired features was over budget at \u20ac13.70. To reduce costs, they considered abandoning certain features and opting for cheaper materials.\n\nOne major point of discussion was the inclusion of voice recognition (sample sensor/speaker) versus kinetic energy. To accommodate the voice recognition, cheaper options were explored for other components, such as using standard colors instead of special colors for buttons.\n\nThe group also considered replacing the rubber case with a plastic one to save money, which would also impact the \"fancy\" feel of the product. They debated the necessity of features like the LCD screen and the importance of maintaining a certain level of technical innovation. Ultimately, they decided to remove the LCD screen and speech recognition to meet the budget of \u20ac12.50. They also explored using a single curve instead of a double curve for the case and reducing the number of special form buttons.\n",
    "The discussion includes the pros and cons of voice recognition. \n\nPros:\n*   Voice recognition can be used in conjunction with Thilo's segmenter.\n*   The SRI recognizer can make use of some time marks.\n*   Voice recognition can be used to train a speech detector.\n*   Voice recognition may allow for automated time marking.\n\nCons:\n*   Voice recognition may have trouble with mikes.\n*   SRI recognition experiments are increasing the error rate.\n*   SRI recognizer has issues with the number of Gaussians used in the recognizer.\n*   The SRI recognizer has trouble recognizing female speech.\n*   The segments may have a lot of cross-talk which can affect recognition.\n*   The signal-to-noise ratio can be too low, resulting in errors.\n*   Transcribers may have difficulty with reduced phonetics and abstract concepts.",
    "The discussion on battery options involved several considerations. The Industrial Designer (I_D_) felt that the standard double A and triple A batteries were too bulky. Alternatives such as dynamo charging, solar charging, and kinetic charging were explored. Dynamo charging was deemed impractical due to the need for a handle to wind up. Solar charging would require placing solar cells on the case, which could affect the design and durability. Kinetic charging, similar to that used in wristwatches, seemed promising as it could potentially charge the remote with regular movement. The I_D_ noted that the customer might be irritated by a base.\n\nThe I_D_ ultimately recommended using a small lithium battery, as they are widely available in other electronic products. For the industrial working design, the I_D_ didn't recommend a charger, as it would require a base, making the design bulkier and less appealing to customers who prefer smaller, compact devices. The I_D_ suggested using a standard battery when the customer initially buys the product.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the project was likely considered for inclusion in a conference paper for the following reasons:\n\n*   **Desire to share and receive feedback:** Researchers wanted to share their work with others in the field and get comments or find out more about related research.\n*   **Opportunity to connect with other researchers:** Presenting at a conference would provide an opportunity to talk to other researchers in the field.\n*   **Potential for collaboration:** Sharing the project might lead to deeper connections with other researchers' work and potential future collaborations.\n*   **Showcasing a novel approach:** The project used a new approach that might be interesting to the community.",
    "Kirsty Williams AM did not discuss funding allocated to the consortia. She did not discuss concerns regarding university governance, but she did mention that the UCU was concerned about the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. She stated that there was some way to go to making sure that governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward. Kirsty Williams stated that she did not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers. She was on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. She is not aware of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met.\n\nThere was no mention of admission problems in Wales universities.",
    "The team discussed and evaluated different energy sources for the remote. They decided to use kinetic batteries, which could potentially attach to the flipping open and shut motion of the remote for additional power. For technological innovation, the team initially considered voice recognition software but ultimately decided against it due to cost concerns and a desire to meet the project's budget. They explored a beeper function as an alternative for locating the remote but didn't fully commit to it. The team also decided to use standard transmission with the TV using standard chips.\n\nOverall, the team rated the prototype against several criteria, including ease of use, fashionability, feel, technological innovation, and integration of fruit and vegetable colors. They made trade-offs between desired features and cost constraints, ultimately prioritizing a distinctive design and core functionality over advanced features like voice recognition. The final decision was to proceed with a prototype that met the budget and key market research criteria, with recommendations for potential future upgrades.\n",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the remote. The industrial designer mentioned the use of a rubber coating for durability and a squishy feel. They also considered scroll buttons versus rubber buttons, opting for the latter to reduce microchip usage and costs. The voice recognition feature, incorporating the latest designs from their research team, was highlighted.\n\nRegarding the energy source, the team debated between solar cells with a backup battery and removing the solar cells altogether. The solar cell was seen as integral to the environmental theme, but its cost pushed the project over budget. Eventually, they decided to remove the solar cells.\n\nThe discussion regarding the project announcement email centered on getting the consent of people who had been recorded during meetings. They discussed the language of the email and the amount of time that people should be given to review the transcripts.\n\nThe sample sensor was mentioned in the context of the prototype's features. It was described as functioning as both a speaker and a sensor simultaneously.",
    "The key points and problems reviewed in the last meeting were:\n\n1.  **Transcription Status**: The group discussed the status of transcriptions, including both internal efforts and those outsourced to IBM. There was a delay in getting feedback from IBM on the initial batch of transcriptions.\n2.  **Information Retrieval (IR) Tools**: Progress was made in using THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data. A system was set up to type in keywords and obtain a list of start-end times for a meeting. The user interface for the system was discussed, with a decision to use the existing THISL GUI tool.\n3.  **XML Tools**: The group discussed moving to XML as the general format for everything. They mentioned that XML tools would allow for extraction and reformatting of data, and that the user database was being converted to XML.\n4.  **Data Storage and Backup**: The group discussed data storage and backup. The group decided against putting Meeting Recorder data on non-backed-up disk.\n5.  **CrossPads**: James Landay inquired about the CrossPads, and if they were not being used, asked that they be returned. The group discussed their usefulness, with concerns about the pen noise and the infrastructure required to synchronize and process the data.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns regarding the Welsh Government's childcare offer. They discussed the \u00a34.50 single national rate, questioning whether it might lead to a two-tiered system where wealthier parents could afford better care through add-ons. Irranca-Davies acknowledged this concern but emphasized that the rate has been welcomed for its simplicity compared to the more complex English system.\n\nThey also talked about access plans, particularly for Cardiff and Newport, where costs are higher, and Irranca-Davies admitted that the \u00a34.50 rate might not be sufficient in these areas. Affordability for the lowest-income working families was another key concern, particularly regarding additional costs like transport and food. Irranca-Davies conceded that in an ideal scenario, these would be covered, but financial constraints necessitate the current approach.\n\nAdditionally, Hefin David AM asked about potential pilots in Cardiff and Newport to assess the \u00a34.50 rate's viability. Qualification and quality of the workforce were also discussed, with concerns about capacity growth and staffing levels to deliver the offer. Irranca-Davies expressed confidence that the sector could grow, supported by a 10-year workforce development plan.\n",
    "The discussion of on-line and phase normalization included the following points. PhD F mentioned his past work with phase normalization, describing it as having provided garbage results using a long-term mean subtraction approach. The PhD student also mentioned that he had been talking to, Andreas and Thilo about the SmartKom language model and about coming up with a good model for, far-mike use of the SmartKom system.\n\nPhD C described his work on on-line normalization, including training with two different means (one for silence, one for speech), and using a time constant that's smaller at the beginning of utterances to adapt more quickly. The professor recommended looking at the kinds of errors.\n\nPhD C thinks it is very important to normalize C-zero and much less to normalize the other coefficients. Graduate A said that he is thinking about starting some cheating experiments to determine the relative effectiveness of some intermediate categories that I want to classify for his quals preparation stuff.",
    "The discussion centered on detecting important linguistic features within the audio stream. One approach involved training new VADs (Voice Activity Detectors) and feature nets. The team also explored using TRAPS (Temporal Patterns) for VAD, noting Pratibha's work at IBM, which indicated it could be beneficial. A key idea was to introduce a second feature stream, initially a mel spectrum, in parallel with the existing cepstral stream. This aimed to capture complementary information, especially regarding convolutional effects.\n\nThe advantage of using Noisy-ORs, or hierarchical structures, was highlighted in the context of combining different knowledge sources. Specifically, it was found that using the silence probability from the smaller VAD network, rather than the larger tandem network, improved the system's performance by reducing insertions.\n\nRegarding inclusion in the transcription formalization, the team considered various features, including Wiener filtering, mel scaling, LDA filtering, downsampling, DCT, online normalization, upsampling, and frame dropping. The discussion also touched on the possibility of improving the noise estimator and incorporating the neural net at the end of the processing chain.",
    "The group discussed the possibility of system involvement in demos, backups, and note-taking. \n\nFor demos, they considered integrating the THISL text retrieval system with the Transcriber interface. This would allow users to search for keywords in the transcript and play back the corresponding audio. There was also discussion of incorporating prosodic features into the demo.\n\nRegarding backups, they were advised to use the standard backup system and NW archive for redundancy, rather than relying on non-backed-up disks or CD-Rs.\n\nFor note-taking, the use of CrossPads was discussed. The advantage would be the time-stamped notes, but the pen was noisy and there was infrastructure needed for synchronization and data format conversion. An alternative was a PDA with a wireless card for real-time event marking. It was decided to keep the CrossPads for potential student projects.\n\nProfessor B suggested that it would be a good idea to return one of the CrossPads.\n",
    "The committee discussed issues with HMRC, which led to the Welsh Government suspending their work with them. Sian Gwenllian AM questioned why HMRC was dropped, given previous assurances that they could deliver according to Welsh language standards. Julie Morgan AM stated the main reason for the change was to allow for a more flexible and expanded offer that HMRC could not accommodate. Nicola Edwards added that technical issues, such as Welsh language standards and IT systems, also contributed to the decision. Jo-anne Daniels cited cost concerns, stating that HMRC's final cost estimates were significantly higher than initially outlined, and that working with local authorities would be cheaper and keep investment within Wales. Julie Morgan AM stated that the work with HMRC helped highlight the direction the Welsh Government needed to take.\n",
    "Professor B commented that the Wednesday workshop should involve the linguists in the task and dialogue aspects. The professor thought the person in Grenada was more present than in regular conversation and did a better job than expected. The required elements in the new form arrangement were numbers and clear instructions. Grad A suggested a structure of the belief net using dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out to isolate things related to the trajector, context, and discourse. Grad B's opinion on the belief net structure was that it was a way of playing with the Source-path-goal trajector abstraction and displaying it in a particular way.",
    "Grad E and Grad A express interest in different aspects of their experiments. Grad E, who is newer to the project, focuses on understanding the syntax and underlying structure of the XML data being used. They seek clarity on how the modules interact and the purpose of the data structures, requesting a fleshed-out XML example for better comprehension. Grad E also focuses on the interplay between semantic meaning and pragmatic interpretation within constructions, particularly in the context of the \"where is X?\" question, wondering if polysemy is semantic or pragmatic.\n\nGrad A, on the other hand, focuses on the broader conceptual challenges, particularly in relation to mental spaces and belief nets. Grad A aims to formalize the constructions and how they translate into belief nets, emphasizing the need to address both the linguistic and inferential aspects of multiple models. They also solved the problem of plural nouns counting as noun phrases.\n",
    "The User Interface designer emphasized the importance of voice recognition as a sellable feature. They also suggested having a switch menu to navigate between different functions while minimizing the number of buttons. The final design included speech recognition and minimized the number of buttons by using a switch menu to navigate different functions.\n\nThe Industrial Designer initially favored infrared technology due to its lower cost. However, they were open to radio waves and acknowledged their advantage, but raised concerns about radio wave interference with other appliances, though this was dismissed because of the ability to set a specific frequency. The final decision was to use infrared technology to stay within budget. The extra budget was not used.\n",
    "The professor discussed several key aspects of noise reduction and signal processing. Regarding noise's effect on speech frequencies, there's a need to eliminate very low-frequency components. For noise addition, adding a small amount of speech-shaped noise after spectral subtraction can be helpful, but its effectiveness depends on the context and whether smoothing is applied.\n\nOn smoothing, the professor mentioned frequency smoothing to reduce musical noise, time-domain smoothing, and nonlinear smoothing based on gain. FIR filters were compared to IIR filters with respect to steady state behavior.\n\nWhen dealing with additive noise, the professor suggested that spectral subtraction schemes can be effective. The professor highlighted the assumption of uncorrelated signal and noise, with deviations impacting performance. The professor also mentioned a strategy of doing a first pass with a simpler mechanism, followed by a second pass with a more complex, longer-time version for better accuracy, acknowledging the trade-off between speed and accuracy.",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function as a message sender to the television for basic controls like power, channel, and volume. They considered including numbers (0-9), up/down channel and volume, and mute. The kinetic battery idea was favored for its convenience.\n\nA scroll wheel was debated for channel flipping and volume control, but pushbuttons were ultimately chosen to reduce complexity and cost, aligning with a simple chip. They decided against an LCD screen, leaning towards an on-screen menu for less frequently used settings. They also decided to include a whistle-back function to help locate the remote when lost.\n",
    "The team proposed a snowman-shaped remote control with a small LCD screen, jog-dial, and rubber buttons. The advanced functions will be hidden in the LCD panel and jog-dial. The slogan will be placed on the side or bottom. They agreed on a size of about 10 centimeters and a foggy yellow color for the buttons.\n\nThe Industrial Designer proposed a marketing plan that emphasized the look and color of the product. Marketing agreed that the look was cool, but expressed concern that an unfamiliar button grid or design might not be marketable and suggested different button shapes. The team also discussed the dimensions of the remote and the possibility of using different colors to create a line of products with different themes. Marketing was satisfied with the biomorphic shape, the soft feel of the buttons, and the overall functionality of the product. They also agreed that the voice recognition feature was a major selling point.\n",
    "Grad G is not mentioned in the meeting transcripts.\n\nProfessor C believes that intention should be inferred from features in context, such as \"go to see\" or \"visit.\" He believes that the SmartKom system's parser is too crude to capture the differences in intention. The professor believes the deeper understanding is a combination of contextual, linguistic, and discourse elements.\n\nMSG refers to mental space shifts, and the professor believes that a tourism domain example would be a good choice.\n\nThe professor mentioned that the Orego Graduate Institute crafted a couple of diphone-type voices that are really nice and they're going to use that.\n\nThe professor thinks hiring Fey is OK and that if Fey does the generation thing, then they should be able to get prosody as well.",
    "The Industrial Designer shared several thoughts regarding the remote control's design and technology.\n\n**Appearance Design:** The Industrial Designer favored a single-curved design for a younger, more high-tech look. They preferred rubber over plastic for the casing, as plastic felt cheap. Titanium was considered a trendy case material. They were initially hesitant about incorporating an LCD screen, citing cost concerns and questioning its value when a large TV screen was already present.\n\n**Speech Recognition Technology:** The Industrial Designer was initially doubtful about the effectiveness of speech recognition due to potential issues with voice recognition accuracy, different voice patterns among users, and the cost of a high-quality system. However, they acknowledged its potential as a \"star feature\" if implemented well and in a simple way.\n\n**Bluetooth and New Technologies:** The transcript does not mention Bluetooth. The Industrial Designer was open to kinetic energy as a power source, considering it high-tech and cost-effective. They explored solar panels but found them impractical due to space limitations and insufficient power generation. The Industrial Designer also suggested a separate device for parental control.",
    "The discussions on the priority of inspections and the reopening of the House of Commons in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations were primarily centered around the urgency of addressing specific issues and the desire for parliamentary oversight. There was no agreement between Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders regarding the priority of inspections.\n\nRegarding the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism, Justin Trudeau elaborated on the government's investments in mental health services for those affected by racism and the creation of the anti-racism secretariat with a $4.6 million budget. He acknowledged the need to do more and expressed a willingness to work with opposition colleagues and community leaders. He did not express his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's technical and functional designs, prototype presentation, detailed design, and specific designing requirements. The user interface team presented examples of remotes, highlighting the functions needed and their complexity, such as numbers, power, volume, mute, and play/pause. The marketing team's research revealed user dissatisfaction with current remotes, emphasizing the need for simplicity and a modern design, with channel, volume, and power buttons being the most used. Speech recognition was considered as a potential high-end feature. The industrial designer presented a rough schematic, including a power source (batteries), a smart chip for universal application, a large on/off button, and an infrared bulb for communication. The inclusion of a second bulb to indicate functionality was also suggested. The project manager emphasized the need to incorporate the company color and slogan. The team agreed on a target group spanning kids to adults, with varying technical literacy. Key functions identified included sending messages to the TV, changing channels, and turning the TV on/off, with an emphasis on minimizing the number of buttons. A homing device for easy location was also discussed.\n",
    "The team discussed and evaluated the project's process, work division, and production plan during two meetings.\n\nIn the first meeting, the project manager sought plans from marketing and industrial design, but neither had concrete plans yet. The industrial designer was unaware of the project's goal, believing they were designing a monitor instead of a remote control. The team discussed the remote's functionality and design, with the industrial designer emphasizing a fashionable, attractive product. The project manager requested written plans, including functional and technical designs, team needs, timelines, and budgets, within two weeks. Marketing was tasked with developing a sales plan in coordination with the design team. The user interface designer highlighted the need to interact with the industrial designer.\n\nIn the second meeting, the team finalized the remote control's design, including a snowman shape, no LCD display (initially), kinetic power and battery, rubber buttons, and a jog-dial. They reviewed an expense sheet and discussed cost-cutting measures, ultimately removing the LCD panel. The team then evaluated the design using a rating system, considering design goals and market research. The team also discussed the project's creativity, leadership, teamwork, and available tools, with concerns raised about constraints, a confined framework, and limited collaboration. The team later discussed the evaluation criteria, easy to use, fashionable, feel good, technologically innovative, and squishy and fruity. The team discussed the components to see if they were under budget. The team thought they were stifled for creativity by the company itself in restricting them to only using a TV remote. The team determined that the laptops were extremely handy.\n",
    "Future directions included the potential use of CrossPads, and getting digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting. Participants would be asked to mention something interesting that they learned, as well as to give an oral summary. Discussion of summarization and note-taking was ongoing, and an effort was to be made to collect more meetings and involve people from different groups.\nPhD D explained that they were spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system.\nPhD C and the professor had a discussion about native speakers, and the professor recalled a study that BBN did where they trained on American English and then tested on different native speakers from different areas.\nThe group discussed releasing the meeting data and the impact on people who might not want to be filmed. There was also discussion about the ability to cut things out of the data.\n",
    "Without direct quotes from Ms. Kwan, I can infer the meaning behind her statement about the gap between program development and its implementation. The meeting transcripts reveal several instances where government programs, designed to alleviate the economic hardships caused by the pandemic, are not effectively reaching the intended recipients. For example, there are concerns about the accessibility of the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA).\n\nThe transcripts highlight complaints about the stringent eligibility criteria, bureaucratic hurdles, and delays in fund disbursement. Ms. Kwan's statement likely refers to this disconnect, where well-intentioned programs on paper fail to translate into tangible support for struggling Canadians due to practical challenges in their implementation. This gap can stem from various factors, including inadequate program design, insufficient communication, or administrative inefficiencies, ultimately hindering the programs' effectiveness in addressing the intended problems.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager's views on the last meeting review and market research were mixed. The Project Manager acknowledged the removal of desired features due to budget constraints, leading to a more basic design. The Project Manager seemed concerned about the project's progress, frequently asking for clarification on design specifics, costs, and timelines.\n\nThe group seemed to have a different opinion than the Project Manager. The marketing representative suggested the process felt contrived and constrained by budget limitations. The industrial designer felt the meetings were more like brainstorming sessions and that the environment wasn't conducive to creativity. Both felt restricted by the equipment and structure of the meetings.\n\nThe group discussed the use of a panther as a drawing. The marketing representative initially suggested it, associating it with speed, stealth, and power, reminiscent of a childhood fascination. However, there was also a humorous suggestion to use a pink panther. The discussion about the panther was brief.\n",
    "The team had varied thoughts on the remote control's features.\n\nRegarding buttons, there was a general consensus that fewer buttons were better, aligning with user preferences. Some team members suggested hierarchical structures or sliders for volume and channel control, potentially using an LCD screen to display options. Others considered hiding less frequently used settings under a cover or in a back panel.\n\nThe inclusion of an LCD screen was favored, especially for younger demographics, to support features like channel selection and settings menus.\n\nMicrophone placement was discussed in the context of speech recognition, with considerations for whether it should be on the remote itself or integrated into a base station connected to the television.\n\nThe push-buttons were discussed in relation to the key concepts of the remote control. Large on/off buttons were thought to be good for older demographics.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Canadian tourism industry faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closed provincial and international borders, leading to financial losses for tourism operators. Many small businesses in the tourism and arts and culture industries were falling through the cracks in the government's programs.\n\nThe government took several measures to mitigate the impact. It announced investments of $70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada. The government allocated $500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts, heritage, and sports organizations. Moreover, the government supported destination marketing organizations to encourage local tourism. Additional measures included the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA).",
    "The remote control design presentation covered several key aspects. The interface designer emphasized user-friendliness and attractiveness, including features like voice recognition, channel swapping, volume control, subtitles, and picture adjustments. They presented examples of remotes for children and oversized remotes. The industrial designer focused on components such as the case material (plastic preferred), integrated circuit (sophisticated and temperature-resistant), resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, resonators, and the possibility of a rechargeable battery. They explained the function of each component and the signal transmission process. The marketing manager shared their research on competitor analysis and consumer preferences, highlighting the need for simplicity, intuitive buttons, and a focus on two key features. The team discussed the feasibility and cost of speech recognition, with concerns raised about its reliability and expense.\n\nThe decision was to focus on user-oriented design, company colors and logo, and address the issue of easily lost remotes. A fancy look-and-feel was deemed more important than a purely functional design. The team explored fruit and vegetable themes for the design but acknowledged potential issues with male consumers. The use of a rechargeable battery was decided upon. A prototype using modeling clay was to be created.\n",
    "The group decided to proceed with a cube approach for the multilingual experiments. The three dimensions of the cube are: 1) training data, 2) test data, and 3) acoustic features. The group will experiment with different combinations of training data (TI-digits, Italian, French, Finnish, English, Spanish), test data (Aurora testing set, German, Danish, Spanish), and acoustic features (PLP, MFCCs, J-RASTA, MSG). The goal of the paper is to find a replacement for mel cepstra that is good for any language.\n\nThe paper includes statistics on the performance of the different systems. The goal is to create a system that is robust to noise and can be used in a variety of acoustic conditions. It also includes a chart of the different combinations of training data, test data, and acoustic features that will be used in the experiments. There are 343 different systems that are going to be developed.",
    "The group discussed training and testing the digits corpus, focusing on the feature, training data, and test data dimensions. They used the TI-digit task, along with Italian, French, and Finnish tasks, training neural networks on task data and data from the same language. The current technique involves using mel cepstra and HTK baselines, but there are limitations with acoustic mismatches and telephone bandwidth distortions. Progress includes filling columns with features and nets trained on PLP with online normalization and deltas, which seem important. Delays were experienced due to label format issues, difficulties in combining features, and the need for more data and experiments to address language and noise dependencies. There were also concerns about CPU and memory constraints.\n",
    "In the discussion, \"triple R\" was favored over \"triple RC\" due to its simplicity and catchiness. The group concluded that the target age group should be between 15 and 35, as younger people are more likely to appreciate a sleek design and voice recognition, and have a higher disposable income for such products. The marketing team decided to target young people because they are more open to new technologies and stylish designs.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection focused on balancing simplicity and functionality. The team considered having a smaller number of essential buttons with additional functions accessible through a menu or voice recognition. They also discussed the possibility of a \"finder\" function to locate the remote when lost. The goal was to create a user-friendly and fashionable remote control that appeals to a younger demographic.\n",
    "The group's market research indicated user dissatisfaction with current remote controls. Users find them ugly, use only a small percentage of the buttons, and often lose them. Eighty percent of users are willing to spend more on a fancier remote. Younger users, particularly those aged 15-35, are more interested in features like voice recognition.\n\nDesign opinions leaned towards a streamlined, reductionist approach, focusing on essential functions like power, channel, and volume. There was a push for simplicity and ease of use, with big, user-friendly buttons and a streamlined menu. The team also considered the ergonomics of the remote to avoid repetitive strain injuries.\n\nA key point of discussion was whether to revolutionize remote control interaction. The user interface designer emphasized the need to revolutionize everything from materials to button placement. The group considered speech recognition, rechargeable batteries with a docking station, and a locator feature to address common frustrations.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM addressed several key aspects of her education plan. In terms of quality assurance, the national evaluation and improvement resource was highlighted as a move towards robust self-evaluation across the system, extending beyond individual schools to local education authorities and Welsh Government. Bethan Owen's comment on the high-risk category focused on identifying schools needing support, with an emphasis on earlier intervention to prevent schools from falling into special measures.\n\nThe five principles explained by Kirsty Williams AM centered around the multi-agency approach to supporting struggling schools, involving the school itself, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn, and Welsh Government. Expectations for new examinations and school qualifications emphasized that qualifications should arise from the curriculum, ensuring they serve as gateways to further education.\n\nAddressing doubts about the sufficiency of their actions, Kirsty Williams AM underscored the importance of professional learning, with 50% of targeted resources directed towards supporting teaching professionals. She acknowledged the complexity of drawing direct lines between investment and specific outcomes but reiterated the commitment to aligning resources with international best practices for driving up standards.\n",
    "The team had mixed feelings about the production process. They appreciated the creative freedom in choosing the remote's features, technological advancements, and fashionable aspects, particularly liking the prototype-making stage. The squishy, fruity theme was a hit, with one participant describing the model as resembling a \"giant delicious cookie\".\n\nHowever, they felt stifled by the company's initial restriction to only creating a TV remote. Some team members expressed concerns about the comfort and practicality of the fruit-shaped design, suggesting flatter designs or patterns. They also found some of the provided information and PowerPoint presentations unhelpful and preferred more hands-on approaches like prototype building with Play-Doh. The team also disliked the Microsoft software and found the digital pens clumsy.",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments focused on its implementation and impact on speech recognition performance. One test involved using twelve seconds of past speech to calculate the mean for mean log magnitude spectral subtraction. Compared to a centered window, performance slightly decreased, but this was encouraging for interactive systems. Experiments were also conducted using shorter time frames (two, four, and six seconds) for training models and testing scenarios, revealing that shorter time frames hurt performance, but not significantly (less than 0.5% word error rate increase).\n\nA key question was whether the models used and the time used to calculate the mean during training mattered. It was suggested that mean cepstral subtraction could be viewed as a type of filter, specifically a high-pass or band-pass filter, and that constraining it to only be a subtraction of the mean might limit its potential. The discussion also touched on whether to include silence regions in the mean calculation and the possibility of building up the mean over time. It was also suggested to use a second pass to process speech using longer time subtraction.\n",
    "The discussion covered several topics. There was concern about mixed signals due to varying microphone quality and placement. Postdoc A found the new headphones comfortable, but there were concerns about head size. There was discussion of improving the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) to reduce latency and improve accuracy, with the current VAD outperforming the baseline. There were suggestions for alternative methods to increase space, such as transferring data to interested parties or exploring microphone arrays with external collaborators. The deadline for Eurospeech submission was discussed, with several members working towards preparing papers.\n",
    "Special schools are considered a successful sector. Those that do not perform as well tend to be those that deal with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties.\n\nThere is some confusion about how the PDG for looked-after children is spent, who has the grant, and what the regional consortia priorities are. However, the consortia are using the grant to offer training to schools around emotional behavior and attachment training. There is some school-to-school work being funded by the grant to share best practice. Regional looked-after children coordinators have been appointed to help.\n\nEstyn will need to provide further information about the exclusion rates for looked-after children and how the grant has been used to address those issues. The EAS consortium spends the grant on a specific program aimed at all children considered vulnerable at times of transition, particularly into year 7. Estyn believes that if the grant is specifically for looked-after children, it should be more targeted.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) designer, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager introduced a prototype of the remote control that was intended to be universal. The UI designer emphasized the importance of the remote's appearance and user-friendliness. There was discussion about including a voice recognition feature, though its feasibility and cost were questioned. The industrial designer focused on the technical components, such as the case material, integrated circuits, and the possibility of using a rechargeable battery.\n\nThe team discussed incorporating a user-friendly interface, potentially with a child-friendly design or an oversized remote to prevent misplacement. The marketing expert highlighted the need to differentiate the remote from competitors and focus on a few key features to avoid overwhelming consumers. They considered a soft-feel design and aimed to get the product to market before competitors. The team decided to collaborate on a prototype using modeling clay, with the UI designer focusing on the user interface and the industrial designer on the look and feel. The possibility of including speech recognition was left pending further research on its cost and effectiveness.\n",
    "During the prototype design and evaluation discussions, the Industrial Designer provided several comments regarding the product's appearance, structure, and customer preferences. They noted the curvature of the device and how it would fit in the user's hand, hoping it could be replicated in the final product. The industrial designer also suggested broadening the base so the device could stand, especially if it was to be considered a fashion item.\n\nIn terms of customer preferences, the Industrial Designer acknowledged data suggesting older people might be less willing to pay extra, but the increased functionality and ease of use could compensate. While they believed the device would appeal more to younger demographics conscious of aesthetics, it should still appeal to everyone on some level. The industrial designer also felt that the team was stifled for creativity by the company itself in restricting the team to only using a T.V. remote.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided:\n\n*   **Allocation of $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking:** The transcripts do not mention any allocation of $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking.\n*   **Solution to risk appetite:** The transcripts do not provide a solution to risk appetite.\n*   **Hon. Chrystia Freeland's perspective on systemic racism:** Freeland acknowledges that anti-black racism, unconscious bias, and systemic discrimination are real in Canada. She believes in the importance of disaggregated data, including race-based data, to address these issues. Freeland also emphasizes the government's commitment to upholding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and protecting the human rights of everyone in Canada.",
    "The segmenter's status is that Thilo's segmenter is working well and has high recall. One of the next steps is to move to doing recognition on automatic segmentations instead of hand segmentations. They are sending another sample meeting to the transcribers to see if it fixes the problem of too many beeps in the last transcription. There is a desire to have this process in \"production mode\" by the DARPA meeting in July.",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface (UI) designer and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price due to cost restraints. The UI designer wanted to incorporate several features that would have made the product more expensive. The UI designer disagreed with the redesign after product evaluation because they had to cut everything out because they did not have enough money.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as basic colors as the company's color was yellow.\n\nDuring the discussion of product appearance, the marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the shape of the product because the team felt it was not sleek.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Principal of Cardiff and Vale College, echoed the sentiments of Dafydd Evans and Nick Brazil, stating that employers prioritize core qualifications (e.g., engineering qualifications for engineers) alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. She suggested employers are more focused on these specific qualifications than the Welsh bac.\n\nDafydd Evans, Chair of ColegauCymru, expressed the opinion that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh baccalaureate's meaning and content. He suggested the name \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" would be more helpful. He felt the Welsh Bac is not seen as valuable by employers.\n\nNick Brazil, Deputy Principal of Gower College Swansea, stated that employers rarely request the Welsh baccalaureate from potential employees. He argued that employers are more concerned with professional qualifications and skills. He also noted that while employers may have initially supported the Welsh bac's vision, they now question whether the qualification's demanding nature and bureaucracy truly develop the skills employers need.\n",
    "The team explored several ideas for the remote control's function and design. Initially, the remote was envisioned as snowman-shaped with rubber buttons, kinetic power, and a jog-dial, but cost concerns led to changes.\n\nThe team decided to incorporate a small L_C_D_ screen with menu access via a scroll wheel and confirm button. The L_C_D_ would display basic function information, possibly using symbols for brightness, contrast, and other advanced settings. The slogan would be placed along the side or bottom, with the buttons being large enough for easy use, around one centimeter each. The color scheme would feature a foggy yellow that lights up when a button is pressed.\n\nFunctionally, the remote would control volume, contrast, brightness, audio settings (base, mid-range, high range, left-right balance), and pre-programmed sound modes. To cut costs, the team considered removing the L_C_D_ panel and advanced chip, relying on the T_V_ screen to display the selected settings. The rubber buttons were also removed due to cost.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager had the following thoughts:\n\n*   **Market Range and Price Issues:** The Project Manager questioned whether the target market was large enough to justify the inclusion of speech recognition and whether the ninety-one and seventy-six percent interest translated to sales exceeding four million. The Project Manager wanted the group to consider the financial implications of the product. The project manager also wanted to know how the product would sell internationally and considered if the wealth of a country would have a bearing on the product.\n*   **New Remote Control Features Proposed by Marketing:** The Project Manager was open to the speech recognition idea but questioned the target market size. The Project Manager was open to the idea of incorporating the internet into the remote control.\n*   **Feasibility of the Multipurpose Remote Control:** The Project Manager wanted to know if combining the remote control with other devices such as the audio video of the television set and the DVD player and the CD player would work.\n*   **Cost Constraints and Financial Targets:** The Project Manager was concerned about the cost of components and the overall budget of twelve Euros fifty. The Project Manager also wanted to know how the product would sell internationally.\n*   **Necessity of Setting the Selling Target:** The Project Manager wanted to know if the financial target of fifty million Euro was appropriate.\n*   **Target Market Group:** The Project Manager agreed that the target market was the younger end. The Project Manager questioned whether these people were making purchasing decisions.\n\n",
    "User Interface (UI) had several thoughts and concerns regarding the cost constraints, financial targets, and kinetic battery replacement for the new remote control project. UI mentioned the importance of the remote having a sleek and nice look, as well as being functional. UI was inspired by the iPod style scroll wheel and wanted to incorporate a simple interface with a couple of scroll things. UI also suggested that instead of having a display on the remote, the display could appear on the television screen to save money.\n\nUI also thought that titanium would be great for the case, but they were concerned that it might be too expensive and futuristic, and that plastic would be a better choice. UI was concerned about the cost of adding voice recognition and thought it may not be worth it. UI also wanted a power cradle for the remote to avoid using batteries.\n\nUI thought that kinetic batteries would make the whole thing a lot lighter and more convenient, but acknowledged that it depended on the cost and how much more development and research it needed. Overall, UI wanted to create a remote that was both functional and visually appealing, while also keeping costs down.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements on several aspects of future product ideas. The Industrial Designer wanted to incorporate kinetic energy, believing it would appeal to consumers interested in interesting gadgets and eliminate the need for batteries, addressing a common user frustration. However, Marketing seemed to prioritize other features, such as voice recognition, which they felt would be more impressive to users.\n\nAdditionally, disagreements arose regarding the product's design and features in relation to cost constraints. The Industrial Designer initially leaned towards higher-end materials and features to enhance the product's appeal and innovation. Marketing, on the other hand, was more concerned with keeping production costs down to meet the budget target. This difference in priorities led to debates over the inclusion of special colors, rubber buttons, and other features that added to the overall cost. They later debated the LCD screen.\n",
    "The discussions surrounding HEFCW's powers of intervention highlighted concerns about the inflexibility and cumbersome nature of these powers. HEFCW suggested that the current powers were difficult to use for swift interventions, often relying on informal measures due to the small size of the sector. It was suggested that the HEFCW powers had only three steps, from a \"meeting without coffee\" to institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged this feedback and expressed a desire for more flexible regulatory powers within the new PCET Bill, including the ability to offer advice, guidance, and enhanced monitoring. The aim is to create a graduated escalation of intervention, ranging from supportive measures to more punitive actions in cases of quality or financial failure.\n\nRegarding closure decisions, the Minister stated that institutions have an absolute obligation to meet their commitments to continuing students. HEFCW's quality assurance machinery is expected to ensure that institutions have appropriate arrangements in place for students to complete their programs of study.",
    "The marketing strategy involves creating a fashionable and attractive remote control that people will immediately want. The group plans to target the international market and aims to sell the remote for 25 Euros, with a target profit of 50 million Euros. To achieve this, they need to sell approximately 4 million units, making a profit of 12.5 Euros per unit.\n\nTo achieve the expected profit, the group plans to take 25% of the market in the first year. They are considering selling the remote for 50 Euros, with a production cost not exceeding 25 Euros. They are also exploring alternative sales channels, such as online sales, to reduce storage and labor costs. The marketing team plans to research competitor designs and come up with a new idea to make the remote easier to use. They also plan to collaborate with the industrial design team to ensure the design is marketable and meets user requirements.\n",
    "During the pandemic, the Welsh Government and local authorities collaborated to support free-school-meal children. Schools were repurposed to provide safe places for these children, along with those of key workers and vulnerable children. While schools were used as hubs for food distribution in the short term, longer-term plans were developed to ensure seamless provision, even during formal holiday periods. The goal was to avoid disruptions and maintain consistent support for families relying on free school meals. The Welsh government aimed to create a system where it would not matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It wouldn't matter to those nurses and doctors who would need to be in work during those weeks.",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad because it was perceived to be more fashionable. The curved design also allowed for a more ergonomic fit in the palm of the hand. User Interface agreed on \"easy to use\", \"fashion\", \"easy to find\", and \"robust\" features because market research indicated that consumers prioritize a stylish appearance (\"fashion\") above all else. \"Easy to use\" was also considered important, but less so than appearance. The \"easy to find\" feature was incorporated by including a tracking device. The remote also needed to be \"robust\" to withstand potential mishandling.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by referencing research on current trends. The research indicated a preference for fruit and vegetable-inspired designs and spongy, tight materials, suggesting a move towards more tactile and organic aesthetics. However, there was also discussion about the practicality and longevity of these trends.\n"
