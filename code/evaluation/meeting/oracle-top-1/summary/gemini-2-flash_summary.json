    "The group was concerned with several changes regarding their models. They wanted to address cross-language and cross-task issues. They also wanted to explore combinations of features and multi-band approaches. The group wanted to determine what aspects of their work could be blended with OGI's work. A central issue was the number of parameters in the neural net and whether increasing them would improve performance, especially with diverse training data.\n\nThe Professor touches on the topic of English when discussing multi-language data sets. He states that the inclusion or exclusion of English does not make a big deal. He suggests that the issue is not so much cross-language, but cross-type of speech. The participants also mentioned that they were training the networks on the Aurora TI-digits, which contains English data.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in influencing decision-making within the belief network. They aimed to define how user characteristics (e.g., thriftiness, interests) and situational factors (e.g., location, time constraints) affect decisions like entering a site or choosing a path.\n\nThe discussion touched on how to represent these factors discretely, such as defining the values for a \"running budget\" or a user's \"finance\" policy (cheap, average, spendy). They explored whether the user's budget should be a continually updating number external to the belief net, influencing decisions through defined ranges. Concerns were raised about the computational complexity of propagating belief updates every time the user budget changes.\n\nThe group also considered the relationship between user models, ontology information, and discourse to decide on endpoints. They spoke about the properties of entities (e.g., commercial, landmark, accessible) and whether these properties should be primitive features or derived from other attributes. The group also talked about the importance of external factors on the user, such as how tired or broke the user is.\n",
    "The discussions regarding the Canadian economy centered on its uncertainty due to COVID-19. Cathy McLeod highlighted the pre-existing economic troubles and criticized the government's lack of an economic update, contrasting it with household budgeting practices. Mona Fortier acknowledged the economic uncertainty but emphasized the government's transparency and support measures. She stated an update would be provided when clear economic projections were possible.\n\nCathy McLeod criticized the government for radio silence on the forestry industry, while supporting other sectors. She also likened the government to a sports car with a history of breakdowns. Mona Fortier reiterated the commitment to the forestry industry and highlighted support through existing programs. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie's views were not directly mentioned.\n",
    "The industrial designer focused on the tiger's hunting strategy, noting that the tiger hunts for prey in a \"very well-thought way.\" Additionally, the industrial manager mentioned that the tiger always seeks security, looking for a hiding spot before acting. These characteristics\u2014thoughtful planning and prioritizing security\u2014were what the industrial manager found worthy of studying for the product design.\n",
    "The team discussed the current transcriber interface and potential alternatives. There was a general consensus that the Tcl-TK interface was slow, especially when loading waveforms, making it impractical to switch visuals quickly. Grad E mentioned an earlier interface showing a ribbon for each waveform, but it was also slow to scroll, even with only three waveforms.\n\nPhd B suggested showing one channel at a time to adjust boundaries, but Grad E pointed out this would require seven times real-time for a meeting with seven channels. Postdoc A noted that breaths and other non-speech sounds are visible on the waveform, which could be helpful.\n\nAlternative transcription tools were mentioned, including XWaves. Grad G suggested preloading all channels, and Postdoc A proposed using multiple Transcriber interfaces in different windows as a temporary solution. The team agreed that if seeing visuals was deemed necessary, a new interface should be developed. PhD D suggested loading chopped-up waveforms to speed up the process.",
    "The industrial designer presented findings about remote controls, noting the extensive use of plastic for cost-effectiveness and the presence of wires connecting components. They suggested features like a low-battery beep and a \"find me\" function. The designer also explored the possibility of interchangeable covers, targeting trendy individuals or children who might personalize them.\n\nThe marketing team presented market research indicating that channel selection is the most frequently used button, while audio adjustments are less important. The younger demographic is more interested in customization options. The team suggested that a good-looking remote control would be a selling point.\n\nThe user interface team discussed the essential functions of a remote control, such as power, channel switching, volume control, and teletext. They raised the question of whether to focus on a basic or multifunctional design. The team also explored the idea of incorporating an LCD screen for menu navigation, suggesting four arrow buttons for ease of use.\n",
    "The early implementer areas have been valuable in identifying lessons for the wider roll-out of the childcare offer. One significant lesson is the administrative burden placed on local authorities and parents due to the current eligibility verification process, which involves collecting wage slips and birth certificates. This is particularly challenging for families with complex backgrounds.\n\nAnother key lesson is the uneven distribution of demand for services within early adopter areas, influenced by economic and cultural factors. For example, in some areas, there is a tradition of family-based childcare, leading to lower demand for formal childcare services.\n\nDespite these challenges, the early implementer areas have not experienced problems with capacity, whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision, whether it's in children with complex needs. The pilot areas have provided insights into workforce and physical resource needs, enabling targeted development efforts.\n\nThe experiences in these areas have reinforced the importance of clear communication with parents and providers and the need for a phased roll-out to address challenges specific to different regions, such as rurality or higher costs in urban areas.\n",
    "The Project Manager had mixed feelings about the product's features. They agreed to implement both LCD and speech recognition initially. However, due to cost constraints (a maximum production cost of 12.5 Euros), the Project Manager advocated for scrapping speech recognition to stay within budget.\n\nThey emphasized the expense of the LCD display and were open to potentially removing it. The Project Manager was firm on keeping the push buttons for functionality. They suggested offering customizable covers to maintain a trendy design while delivering a basic, functional product, since the marketing research indicated customers liked the \"squishy feeling\" of the rubber material for the covers. They favored keeping the rubber material over a special color, citing its durability.\n\nUltimately, the Project Manager prioritized staying within budget and suggested making it clear to the customer that design choices were influenced by cost constraints. They also acknowledged that they missed the opportunity to discuss the LCD display more.\n",
    "The team discussed recording conventions, focusing on audio quality and data cleaning. They addressed audio monitoring issues, like spikes, and considered wireless microphones to improve recording quality. A significant part of the discussion was on transcription conventions, including consistent handling of numbers, acronyms, and comment types (vocalized, non-vocalized, glosses). \n\nThe team also discussed incorporating video recordings. They talked about providing transcripts to participants for review and bleeping out sections they didn't want included. There was a debate on the best approach: a web interface versus printouts, balancing convenience with privacy and the potential for over-editing. They decided on a compromise where participants would be contacted to review transcripts, with a web interface available if needed. The team emphasized that the participants would need to be made aware that the goal was to use as much of the recording as possible.\n",
    "The discussion on project finance included calculating the total cost of the project at 12.3 Euros, including the cost of a regular chip and a sample speaker. The possibility of adding a homestation for an additional 20 cents was also discussed.\n\nThe \"drawing board\" was used to visualize and refine the remote control's design. The team discussed the layout of buttons, including basic functions and a second level of options. The industrial designer was asked to draw the second level to illustrate its functionality, including how it slides open. The team considered different options for the second level's design, such as a slide-out or a clap-open mechanism. They also discussed saving the drawing file.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer seemed primarily concerned with the practical aspects of visual representation, questioning the difficulty of drawing certain animals like a panther.\n\nThe Project Manager was focused on guiding the discussion and keeping it on track. They directed the team to focus on the whiteboard exercise and later steered the conversation towards financial aspects, emphasizing the target selling price and profit margin.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that further market research was needed. Specifically, they noted the user interface designer's concern that the specified price point seemed high for a remote control, leading the Project Manager to suggest that the marketing team should investigate what features and functionality consumers expect at that price. This indicated a need to better understand consumer expectations and market demand before finalizing the product design and specifications.\n",
    "The team decided against a base for the remote, favoring a smaller, more advanced design. The team briefly considered an old-fashioned telephone design, but the team ultimately decided against it. In terms of fashionability, the team acknowledged current trends, like fruits and vegetable patterns, but decided against incorporating them, as they wanted a product with longevity. They explored options like a spongy feel for the buttons, and different materials for the casing, including wood, titanium, and plastic. Ultimately, the team decided on a plastic base with latex covers that could be changed to match current trends. The team also discussed the button design, with options like scroll buttons on the side and a central button that could feature the company logo. They considered illuminating the buttons upon contact and explored different color options for the buttons and casing.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of the remote control design. They considered using an environmentally friendly material, with the trend leaning towards a fancy look and feel, possibly incorporating spongy, tight materials and fruit/vegetable colors. Potential materials included plastic, wood, latex, titanium, and rubber.\n\nThe discussion touched on the user interface, with an LCD screen being considered for advanced features but ultimately decided against due to cost and practicality. The group favored pushbuttons over a scroll wheel to keep costs down and simplify the design. They also discussed the possibility of a kinetic battery.\n\nThe team considered a questionnaire or market research to gauge consumer preferences. They discussed the possibility of changeable covers in different fruit and vegetable colors, and the packaging being designed like a lemon peel.\n",
    "The Project Manager introduced the remote control prototype, highlighting its standard battery, banana-shaped case, and spongy rubber material. The group evaluated the prototype based on criteria like fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, fashion, findability, and robustness, using a scoring system from one to seven.\n\nThe discussion revealed differing views on the product's \"fancy\" and \"fashionable\" aspects. The Industrial Designer gave a lower grade in \"fancy look and feel\" due to a lack of innovation, excluding the wheel. The \"fruit shape\" design was considered fashionable, leading to a higher score. The rubber material contributed to a high robustness score.\n\nThe technological aspect received lower grades. The absence of voice control contributed to lower technological aspect grades. The potential inclusion of lighting, made possible by a transparent material, was discussed.\n\nThe transcript does not include any discussion of a locator in presenting the functional requirements.\n",
    "PhD A (Jose) and PhD C agreed to examine energy levels, moving from log energy to regular energy, as the log domain might be compressing the distinctions they were seeking. Jose was initially normalizing data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation in the log domain. PhD C suggested that looking at the distribution of raw energy might be more revealing initially, before delving into complex scatter plots or derivatives.\n\nThe discussion with Jose revolved around his methods of measuring energy at the frame level with a constraint of at least 200 milliseconds. PhD C pointed out that Jose's intuition from looking at the data suggested that energy increased during overlapping speech, and any measure should align with this intuition.\n\nThe difficulty faced was the potential for the standard deviation, variance, and other statistical measures to obscure the underlying patterns, making interpretation harder than simply visualizing the distributions. Overlaps in the data made it difficult to discern clear patterns.\n",
    "The discussion on latency centered around the delay introduced by the smoothing process in spectral subtraction, specifically due to the recursive estimation of means for the gain curve. Instead of using the current estimated mean, it was found better to use an estimate from the future, adding a delay. This delay was quantified at 50 milliseconds.\n\nProfessor C expressed concern about completely ignoring latency, fearing it could lead to complications if significant adjustments were needed later. He advised being conservative about it. The issue is that the system should be interactive and a long latency would be detrimental to the user experience.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) design for the prototype introduced several features. Ergonomics were prioritized with a focus on a comfortable shape. The material chosen was wood, which allowed for customizable colors through staining. Functionally, the design incorporated essential controls such as power, volume, channel, menu, and voice recognition.\n\nA key element was the inclusion of an LCD screen on a flip panel. The UI featured a large, easily accessible on/off button, a numeric keypad, and dedicated buttons for menu access and voice recognition deactivation. An additional feature was the potential for customized backing, extending to the flip case, depending on the internal circuit board design. The placement of the microphone was discussed, with considerations for usability and accessibility, ultimately suggesting a side placement for continuous voice activation.\n",
    "The industrial designer presented the prototype model, highlighting its features. The design includes a titanium back and lower front, with the company's double R logo and slogan in an arc shape above it. Channel and volume controls, with arrow shapes, are located in the middle of the front, with an \"Okay\" button. The device allows recording using the back.\n\nTwo versions were discussed: one aimed at a younger audience with sparkly, fruity colors, and another with a titanium look intended for older users, appealing to a more classical aesthetic.\n\nThe discussion focused on the device's ergonomics and appearance. The project manager initially expressed concern about the side view, feeling it wouldn't fit comfortably in the hand. However, the design team defended the prototype, emphasizing how it's naturally held and used. Despite the project manager's personal reservations, the team agreed to move forward with the design.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed various aspects of the new product's design, including the touch screen, flip screens, battery, and overall form factor, all while keeping budget limitations and general functionalities in mind.\n\nThe touch screen was initially considered a key marketable feature but was questioned due to its high cost (estimated at \u20ac17.50 per remote), potentially pushing the final price beyond the target. The group explored the possibility of a simpler, cheaper touch screen, but ultimately leaned towards voice recognition as the primary selling point due to existing in-house technology and lower cost.\n\nFlip screens were mentioned as a potential alternative to the touch screen, offering additional functionality without the high cost. However, the group also considered a simpler design with a non-remote look, potentially incorporating a slide or compartment for less frequently used buttons.\n\nBattery options were also debated, with solar power being favored for its environmentally friendly theme, although a backup battery was deemed necessary for situations with limited light exposure. Lithium batteries were considered but would require a new manufacturer.\n\nThe overall design aimed for a non-traditional remote look, potentially with a rubberized or tactile case, drawing inspiration from Apple's design language. The group discussed offering multiple case colors to broaden market appeal.\n",
    "The Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda. Key lessons include the importance of strong, capable school leadership, comprehensive systems for tracking and processes within schools, teacher quality, and collaborative activity where schools learn from each other. The program's best practices are being embedded in the new support provided by regional consortia, with some of the most effective individuals from Schools Challenge Cymru now working for these consortia.\n\nThe Government is confident that the level of momentum is continuing through the consortia, and that there is minimal risk of schools slipping back. Schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Schools that are categorised as red schools are entitled to 25 days of support. The Government has also invested over \u00a310 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work.",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes that Brexit has had an impact on Wales' higher education system. He notes a decrease of 8% in applications from EU students, contrasting with an increase in England. He attributes this decline to two main factors: changes in student support arrangements for EU students, where they now have to find the full fee, and the Anglocentric nature of the media and the relatively better investment in facilities, particularly buildings and equipment, in England, making Welsh institutions appear less attractive.\n\nDr. Blaney emphasizes the importance of presenting Wales as a good place to study, highlighting the \"Study in Wales\" program as a collective effort to distinguish studying in Wales from the rest of the UK. He suggests that prospective students should choose Wales due to its relative safety and supportive environment, offering a UK-quality education in a more comfortable setting.\n",
    "The mental spaces in this model consist of three domains: observable features, a middle layer of hidden variables, and an output layer representing the interaction mode (Tango, Enter, Vista).\n\nThe observable features domain includes elements extracted from communication (prosody, discourse, verb choice, admission fee), world knowledge (\"nice walls,\" time of day), and situational context (tourist/business person/unknown).\n\nThe middle layer functions as a bridge between the extracted features and the interaction mode. It aims to capture abstract concepts like whether the user is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry. These hidden variables probabilistically depend on the observable features and, in turn, influence the probability of different interaction modes. The goal is to prevent features from directly affecting the mode and instead channel them through these higher-level concepts.\n",
    "The professor believes that the back-end being used is simple and may have some issues. He suggests that there might be something fundamentally wrong with it, but he isn't sure if the issues stem from the back-end itself or the data being used. He is interested in experimenting with the number of Gaussians. The professor emphasizes the importance of a large amount of training data, referencing what commercial places do. He thinks the amount of training data is the reason for the tandem system's poorer performance. He suggests that with enough data, word models could be effective due to the increased occurrences of similar allophones.\n",
    "The transcripts reveal discussions on several critical issues:\n\n**Seniors Care Crisis:** The dire situation in long-term care facilities during the pandemic was highlighted, with concerns raised about elder abuse, neglect, and disproportionately high death tolls. The Canadian Armed Forces' involvement in assisting these facilities was noted.\n\n**Racism and Long-Term Care:** The intersection of racism and long-term care was not explicitly discussed in government policy, but systemic racism against Indigenous and Black people was acknowledged, particularly within the RCMP and the justice system. Calls were made for reviews of the use of force, collection of race-based data, and addressing systemic discrimination.\n\n**Worker and Pensioner Rights:** Amendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were mentioned in the context of Bill C-8, regarding conversion therapy, and Bill S-204, addressing forced organ harvesting. There were also discussions on the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and their impact on workers.\n\n**Hon. Lawrence MacAulay's Perspective on Veterans:** Minister MacAulay emphasized the government's openness to public debate on policies affecting veterans and their families. He affirmed the commitment to providing appropriate compensation and addressing backlogs at Veterans Affairs Canada.\n\n**Minister of Seniors' Statement on Pandemic Assistance:** While a specific statement from the Minister of Seniors isn't detailed, there was a general discussion about pandemic assistance for seniors, including increasing the Old Age Security benefit and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.\n",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer experienced disagreements on the remote control design due to differing priorities and perspectives. The Industrial Designer focused on innovative technical aspects like kinetic energy, advanced chipsets, and modern aesthetics (curved shapes, rubber material) to appeal to younger demographics. Marketing, informed by trend-watching in Paris and Milan, emphasized user-friendliness, customizable features (removable covers, color choices), and parental control options to cater to a broader audience, including older demographics. The Project Manager aimed to balance these competing desires within budget and technical constraints, leading to debates over material choices (plastic vs. rubber), energy sources (kinetic vs. battery), and the complexity of features like parental control and voice recognition. Ultimately, the disagreements stemmed from balancing innovation, user needs, market trends, and technical feasibility.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation based on complaints from users interviewed earlier. The specific criteria they brought forward were:\n\n*   **Did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote?** The team debated the aesthetics, considering color and modern design in relation to current electronics like LCD displays.\n\n*   **Did we make it simple for new users?** The team felt it was intuitive, with controls reduced to channel and volume. Speech recognition was discussed as a potential enhancement.\n\n*   **Did we address the issue of losing the remote?** Solutions like speech recognition or an anti-theft alarm system (similar to those used for luggage) were considered to help locate the remote.\n\n*   **Did we put the fashion in electronics?** The team discussed if the design was modern.\n\nMarketing allowed the team to assign a rating to each criteria, with the team debating the rating to assign. Marketing indicated there was no scale that had to be hit, and the team was free to evaluate as they saw fit.",
    "The current status of transcription involves a few key points. Jane has transcribed a 45-minute meeting, which has been sent to IBM for comparison. IBM has also received about 10 hours of recorded data, but it has not been transcribed yet. There is a plan to send additional hours to IBM soon. The transcription process may need adjustments, especially for multi-channel audio.\n\nRegarding recordings, the team is aiming for three to four meetings per week, but they are also exploring opportunities to record meetings from external sources, such as broadcast media. As for intermediate categories, Jose is working on identifying acoustic events, including overlaps, breaths, aspirations, and non-speech sounds, but the team is considering focusing on speaker overlaps to speed up the process. They are also exploring the possibility of using automatic methods to detect speaker overlaps.\n",
    "Regarding the duty to promote public awareness, the Deputy Minister introduced amendments 1 and 4 to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law. She rejected amendments from another member that highlighted specific groups or topics, arguing they were unnecessary and could constrain the awareness campaign.\n\nOn the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2 for a post-implementation review, influenced by a committee recommendation. She opposed an amendment requiring a report on the awareness campaign's effectiveness before section 1 commenced, deeming it unnecessary and potentially delaying implementation. She did agree to consider an interim report and consult with the committee on its contents.\n\nConcerning regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 3 to add existing power back onto the face of the Bill. She initially resisted broader regulation-making powers but agreed to discuss the matter further before Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion highlighted the long-term goal of raising educational standards and attainment in Wales, with Qualifications Wales playing a key role in maintaining standards through the regulation of awarding bodies like WJEC. Philip Blaker emphasized that their focus is on ensuring fair grading and comparability of outcomes, particularly during periods of change.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of resources, the witnesses discussed the challenges posed by short timelines for qualification reforms, largely driven by alignment with England. However, with the divergence in GCSEs and A-levels between the two countries, there's an opportunity to establish timelines that allow for greater system readiness in the future. Blaker suggested a \"go/no-go\" decision point in 2023 regarding the new curriculum, with the possibility of delaying qualification reforms if conditions aren't suitable, prioritizing the quality and fairness of implementation over adherence to a strict timeline.\n",
    "The meeting transcript does not contain a discussion on the challenges of implementing good practice across all parts of Wales and the implications for childcare services. The meeting focused on school improvement and raising standards in Wales. Discussions included the involvement of the OECD in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey, the use of powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, the national evaluation and improvement resource, investment in school standards, and support for schools causing concern. The categorization system for schools, Estyn inspection reports, and local intelligence were mentioned as ways to identify schools needing support. The meeting also touched on the performance of pupils eligible for free school meals and minority ethnic learners, as well as the role of regional consortia and the middle tier in supporting school improvement.\n",
    "The discussion covered the availability and selection of components for a new remote control design. For the case material, the team decided on a plastic shell with a rubberized cover to provide a spongy feel, aligning with current fashion trends. The rubber cover would also allow for interchangeable designs and colors, taking inspiration from fruits and vegetables. Titanium was considered but deemed too restrictive in terms of shape and customization options.\n\nRegarding the user interface, the team explored various options for the buttons and display. They considered a bare printed circuit board, rubber buttons (possibly made from anti-RSI material), and an LCD screen with a graphical user interface (GUI). The final decision was to use an LCD screen on the top side of the flip-top design and rubberized buttons on the bottom side for frequently used functions like volume and channel control. Touch screen capabilities and a stylus were also discussed, but concerns were raised about potential wear and tear. The team agreed to standardize the central pattern of volume and channel controls, as this is a common feature across most models.",
    "Professor B expresses that the unified software is close in performance to the best previous version but does not utilize the full \"bag of tricks.\" He emphasizes the importance of establishing a firm path forward, particularly regarding time-series data, before Hynek's return. He suggests initially sticking with a defined set of parameters, as other system changes will likely prompt revisiting these choices later. The neural net's placement, either server-side or terminal-side, is discussed, considering factors like size and the potential to focus solely on past data.\n\nRegarding time series, there's a discussion about latency, with concerns about meeting standards requirements. The group debates the trade-off between latency and performance, with Professor B suggesting prioritizing performance initially and addressing latency if necessary. There is no mention of reverberation in this set of meeting transcripts.\n\nThe discussion of pronouncing zero is not present in this set of meeting transcripts.\n",
    "The group discussed the introduction of a new remote control, focusing on several key aspects.\n\n**Concept Decisions:** The team decided to use a combination of kinetic and battery power for the remote, with kinetic as a backup. The remote's case will be double-curved and made of rubber, with removable covers for customization. An LCD screen with an advanced chip set was favored, but a fallback to simple buttons was considered if budget constraints arose.\n\n**Universal Remote:** The team mentioned that the new remote should work on most TVs with a separate device.\n\n**Parental Control:** The team explored a parental control feature with profiles (parent, children) and a log-in functionality. While there was debate on the complexity and resources required, the team acknowledged a market for parental controls.\n\n**Games and Voice Recognition:** The team generally agreed that including games might be too much, but voice recognition was seen as a potentially nice addition if it didn't add significant cost. The voice recognition shouldn't be a primary feature.\n",
    "The group discussed the potential increase in suicide among children and young people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaughan Gething stated that the government commissioned a review, through the delivery unit working with the national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths during the pandemic's start to understand if restrictions led to a spike in suicide. The report was expected by the end of the month, and Gething offered to share it with the committee upon receipt. He also assured that crisis care services for children and young people remained available.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Gething mentioned the government's efforts to ensure consistent support for women across Wales during this difficult time, primarily through phone and online services. He acknowledged the challenges of providing this support and the pause in work to create in-patient capacity due to the pandemic. He also noted a decrease in women willing to use mother and baby unit provision due to fear and lockdown, which the government is aware of.\n",
    "The work of Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group, which is reviewing the role of the middle tier, is ongoing. They are agreeing to a plan to support the successful implementation of the curriculum. There is no definitive timeline for completion given, but the Minister stated that the history of devolution is full of fantastic documents and patchy implementation and the work that has gone into the curriculum is too important to leave implementation to chance. There is no risk of losing focus; they are very clear about establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players. The committee is making sure that there isn't duplication, that people aren't second-guessing each other's work, and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system. The committee is committed to continuing to support educational opportunities, and that's why they have ring-fenced the minority ethnic achievement grant.\n\nThere were no discussions regarding networking within the PRU. Transition arrangements were not discussed in the meeting transcript.\n",
    "The group discussed infra-red functionality with the consensus that it was the best way to project information to the receiver because it doesn't require a sight line. They emphasized the importance of a reliable and clear infra-red signal so the user wouldn't have to wave the remote around. Quality components were also stressed to ensure functionality.\n\nRegarding disposable income, the team considered aiming the remote at a younger demographic (15-35) because they associated that group with having more disposable income for technology. However, it was also mentioned that the remote should be marketable to whomever it is, especially given the 25 Euro price point. They also discussed defining the target group based on how much money they have to spend.\n",
    "The group generally acknowledges that using eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as a measure is imperfect but consider it the best available proxy for identifying pupils to target in the absence of a better alternative. There are ongoing discussions about the impact of Universal Credit and potential future changes to eligibility criteria.\n\nRegarding the impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, the group notes improvements in attendance rates for FSM pupils. They cite examples of schools using PDG funding for initiatives like \"walking buses\" and employing staff to work directly with families to address barriers to attendance. However, they also acknowledge that a significant gap remains between the attendance of FSM and non-FSM pupils, and further efforts are needed to close this gap and improve engagement. They discuss the challenges of implementing effective interventions for older children and the importance of a multi-agency approach to address the complex needs of some FSM pupils.\n",
    "The professor did not discuss support vector machines in great detail, but he did say that they are succinct. He also stated that the neural net approach or Gaussian mixtures are brute force, and support vector machines are better because they reduce the parameterization of the model by keeping selected examples.\nThe professor did not comment on speech rate algorithms, but he did mention that someone tried a mean subtraction method that helped in a reverberation case. The error rate went from eighteen percent to four percent. On meeting recorder far mike digits, mike on channel F, it went from forty-one percent error to eight percent error.",
    "Professor B expresses concerns about artificially imposed reverberation-like effects due to non-causal windows in the re-synthesis process, suggesting that low-energy sections of speech are most affected by reverberation. He proposes a VAD-like approach to remove very low-energy sections, especially if echoes or pre-echoes are causing problems. He also mentions high-pass filtering to reduce reverberation effects and suggests that removing low-energy segments might be beneficial. Professor B also mentions that the term reverberation is being used in two ways, both removing and adding reverberation due to averaging over multiple windows.\n",
    "The team discussed several ideas for the new remote control's user interface, focusing on functionality and market appeal. The User Interface Designer suggested a conventional push-button design with more sophisticated programming capabilities, like macros, similar to high-end touchscreen remotes. This would allow users to integrate control between multiple devices.\n\nAnother idea involved gaming integration, with big buttons for directional input and camera angle changes, addressing the shortcomings of current remotes as gaming interfaces. An industrial designer proposed incorporating a joystick-like stick for gaming. Ergonomics and aesthetics were also considered, aiming for a comfortable, stylish, and slightly unconventional design that fits well in the hand. The team agreed to explore these ideas further, focusing on user needs and macro functionality, before the next meeting.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the project manager's thoughts on the plastic material, changeable cover, color, and shape of the model are somewhat unclear and evolving.\n\nRegarding the material, the project manager acknowledges the initial \"titanium idea,\" but also considers the \"fudge titanium.\"\n\nRegarding the changeable cover, the project manager seems concerned with the design and whether it is fancy. They also express confusion about the purpose of the \"rubber fruit,\" questioning if it is for fanciness or usefulness. They later acknowledge its potential as a protection for the remote control.\n\nRegarding the color, the project manager acknowledges the color options for the LCD screen but doesn't express a clear opinion on the case color, only noting that it is \"titanium.\"\n\nRegarding the shape, the project manager expresses uncertainty about the shape, stating, \"No, I'm not sure why if it was like this,\" suggesting they are not completely convinced by the current design.\n",
    "The discussion focused on various system configurations and improvements to the baseline OGI system. One key area of exploration was the \"combo\" system, which combines features processed through a network with low-pass filtered versions. Different architectures were compared, including variations with and without low-pass filtering and KLT (Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve transform). A silence detection method (\"filt\") was explored but faced challenges due to delay issues on the server side.\n\nThe team considered a weighting scheme (40% TI-digit, 60% SpeechDat-Cars) to evaluate the overall performance of the different system configurations. There was also discussion on the size of the test sets and the statistical significance of the observed differences in performance. They planned to focus on three or four architectures, including one with a single KLT, for further evaluation and system fixing. The goal was to finalize the system based on the development data, considering the impending deadline for submission.\n",
    "The meeting transcript primarily focused on the \"Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales\" draft strategy. There was no discussion on legislation, sports infrastructural construction, government support for energy resources and tourism, funding in green economy and small businesses, and the impact of Covid-19 on fishing, tourism, oil, and gas.\n\nThe discussion centered around childhood obesity, engagement with young people, setting targets for obesity reduction, investment needed for the plan, and the use of revenue from the levy on soft drinks. The committee discussed the importance of evaluation and data collection, community sport infrastructure, the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme, and the clinical obesity pathway.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote control's design and functionality, emphasizing a fancy outlook over pure functionality, aligning with market survey findings. The team considered the number of functions, opting for fewer buttons and easy-to-understand manuals. A novel shape was explored, with the idea of a fruit or vegetable-inspired design, even considering a spongy, lemon-like feel.\n\nPersonalization was also discussed, including interchangeable casings in different fruit shapes. However, the team debated the feasibility of personalization due to budget constraints and usability concerns, particularly regarding an LCD screen. A double-curved, ergonomic shape was favored for ease of use, although a banana shape was briefly considered. The team ultimately decided to take inspiration from fruits rather than replicating them exactly and leaned towards a single-curved design, and also settled on a spongy latex rubber material for the casing, with yellow as the main body color.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed using lemon or lime colors for the product based on emerging European fashion trends featuring fruits and vegetables, specifically in clothes and furniture. The team felt it was important to observe this trend and consider how it could be incorporated into the product's design to make it fashionable and appealing. The goal was to create a look and feel that was coherent and unified, rather than just a collection of random concepts and technologies. By using a theme like lemon or lime, they aimed to inspire the design and create a marketing identity that would resonate with consumers. They also wanted to ensure that the product felt soft, spongy, and ergonomic, aligning with material trends that favored friendly and comfortable handling.\n",
    "The overall conclusion is that the team has a product specification and prototype design that largely meets the criteria derived from market research and company strategy, with generally high ratings across key areas.\n\nThe remote control features a customizable, fashionable design with potential for fruit/vegetable-inspired colors and a spongy texture. While initially considered, voice recognition was removed due to cost concerns and was considered for a later \"business class\" version. The design aims to minimize repetitive strain injury (RSI) through button material and layout, although this received the lowest, near-neutral rating.\n\nThe team agreed to proceed with prototype production and marketing, believing that current technology limits further RSI minimization. They also recommend increasing the budget based on market research indicating customers are willing to pay more for a better product. The team felt they worked well together and that all opinions were heard and considered.\n",
    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) representatives, Dr. David Blaney and Bethan Owen, assessed the future of institutions in the context of Brexit, noting potential turbulence and the need for careful management. They highlighted the importance of re-establishing funding for higher cost provisions and innovation. Discussions on women's issues were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The committee's statements on housing were not included in the meeting's transcript. Members discussed the impact of Brexit on EU student applications, financial pressures on Welsh higher education, and strategies for attracting international students. Concerns were raised about the Anglocentric nature of the media and the need for Welsh institutions to better sell themselves internationally. The potential impact on research collaborations and funding was also a key point of discussion.\n",
    "The discussion on the Meeting Recorder digits centered on their unexpectedly high error rate (3-4%) compared to the TI-digits database (0.8%) using the tandem system. The participants attributed this difference to the amount of training data, the recording environment, and the lack of strict cleanliness in the Meeting Recorder data compared to the studio-quality TI-digits.\n\nThey also touched on the SRI system's performance with adaptation, noting a significant performance drop without it. There was an idea to feed tandem outputs into the SRI system.\n\nThe group explored potential factors contributing to the higher error rate, including noise robustness of features and channel normalization. They considered the impact of adding more training data and the differences between the Meeting Recorder digits and TI-digits. The discussion also covered voiced/unvoiced detection and the potential use of modulation spectrum as features.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the recommendation for a speech recognition interface stems from the technology department devising a new speech recognition technology. The user interface designer highlights a voice recognition remote control already on the market that can control multiple devices and store up to eighty speech samples. The user interface designer suggests that if a two-part remote design is pursued, the speech recognition programming could be done on the control part, leaving the handheld part simple.\n\nHowever, the transcripts do not explicitly state the benefits of this feature as perceived by Marketing, the industrial designer. The industrial designer is more concerned about the materials and components of the remote control. The marketing team is more concerned about the look and feel of the remote and how well it will be accepted by the target audience. The user interface designer focuses on user-friendliness, suggesting a graphical display like an iPod for control.\n",
    "The discussion on consortia revealed varying opinions on their effectiveness. While Jassa Scott noted improvements in their knowledge of schools' strengths and weaknesses since 2017, there were concerns about their focus on teaching and learning in struggling schools, particularly in secondary education. She said, \"They're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there.\" Estyn doesn't have specific inspection powers regarding regional consortia. Meilyr Rowlands expressed concern about the situation in ERW (Education through Regional Work) due to leadership issues and budget disagreements. He said local authorities are too small to deliver school improvement services.\n\nThere was no mention of Bill Blair or Pearson airport in the transcript.\n\nThe political background involves scrutiny of the Welsh education system by the committee, focusing on standards, curriculum reform, and the role of Estyn. The aim of the group appears to be to ensure standards don't slip during curriculum changes, to address concerns about struggling secondary schools, and to improve the overall quality of education in Wales.\n",
    "The team discussed several key functions and improvements for the remote control. A primary focus was on implementing a \"lost-and-found\" feature. The initial idea involved a beeping sound triggered by clapping, but the team then considered alternative triggers like voice activation. The project manager suggested a light sensor that would activate a beep or light signal when the remote was hidden in a dark place, such as under a newspaper or behind an object.\n\nDuring the project evaluation, the team considered making the remote multifunctional, controlling not only the TV but also other household systems like temperature or air conditioning. They also discussed the need for a trendy design, considering shapes that would feel better in the hand. New functions brainstormed included the light sensor idea and the possibility of the remote responding to a specific trigger to help locate it.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the group considered using \"fruity colors\" for the buttons but worried it might not appeal to their target demographic of middle-aged men and that it might look like a child's toy. There was a suggestion to have a toned-down version with brighter colors to make it hard to lose. The project manager suggested having all the buttons in black with a yellow design on the outside to incorporate the corporate colors, with alternative color options available.\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied because the feature to prevent losing the remote was not addressed. They felt that even with bright colors, the remote could still be easily lost if it was hidden between couch cushions or under covers. Marketing was disappointed that there was no option to include a feature that would help locate the remote.\n",
    "Key points regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension were not explicitly discussed in the provided transcripts.\n\nRegarding employers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate, no information was provided in these transcripts.\n\nIn terms of the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales, the chief inspector stated that he did not want to compare Estyn to Ofsted but that Estyn is a body that is developing and trying new things and evolving continuously. One of the things that Estyn has developed over many years is the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular.",
    "The team held differing opinions on the convenience of presentation materials. The project manager felt that the primary focus should be on ease of use, with larger, well-placed buttons and minimal learning required. The user interface designer suggested features like strategically placed buttons, covered less-used buttons, and potentially a sliding or rolling mechanism for thumb manipulation. They also proposed speech recognition for its novelty, especially among younger users, but acknowledged the energy consumption concerns.\n\nThe industrial designer expressed concerns about the spongy design, while the marketing representative emphasized the importance of a fancy look and feel with advanced technology. The team discussed the size and shape of the device, with the user interface designer suggesting a thinner middle section for better grip. They also explored the idea of a banana shape, aligning with the company's color scheme and current fashion trends, potentially with a peel-like cover for accessing less-used buttons and features.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD screens primarily due to cost concerns and practicality. The industrial designer stated that an LCD screen would require an advanced chip, increasing manufacturing costs. They wanted to avoid making the remote overly technological if it wasn't necessary, to keep the manufacturing price down. Additionally, the user interface designer pointed out that if the device was small, the LCD screen would also have to be small, potentially requiring backlighting due to typical TV viewing environments. There was also the issue of one-way communication, meaning the TV couldn't send information back to the remote's screen. The team favored an on-screen menu displayed on the television, controlled by the remote, as a more practical alternative.\n",
    "The team members introduced themselves with their roles: Project Manager, Industrial Designer, Marketing, and User Interface. The Project Manager also outlined their responsibilities. The project is to design a new, trendy, and user-friendly television remote control aimed at a generation that dislikes plain designs, with considerations for users with visual impairments and ergonomic preferences.\n\nThe brainstorming process began with a team-building exercise using a whiteboard to draw and share their favorite animals and their characteristics. Initial ideas for the remote control included addressing the difficulty of using it in the dark, incorporating a tracking device to locate it, reducing the number of buttons, and exploring more interesting shapes beyond the standard rectangular design.\n\nThe project evaluation involved considering the selling price (25 Euros) and the need to keep production costs significantly lower to ensure profitability. The project process includes individual brainstorming sessions followed by team meetings to discuss functional design, usability, and feasibility. The User Interface Designer will focus on the technical functions design, while the Marketing Expert will provide user requirements.\n",
    "The team had mixed feelings about adding rechargeable units to the remote. The project manager initially thought it might be too costly but acknowledged that if they could sell the remote for around twenty-five Euros, there would be room in the budget for rechargeable units. They also liked that it could solve the problem of users not having batteries when they needed them. The industrial designer questioned the handiness of a rechargeable unit, noting that standard remote batteries can last for two to three years. They also pointed out that a charging base would need its own battery or a connection to a power outlet. The marketing team suggested that if they skipped the recharger, they could create a trendy charging bay. Ultimately, the project manager said that the recharge function would probably be the first thing to skip if costs became an issue.\n",
    "The decision was made to order one Crown CM311AE headset microphone with a Sony jack for $240 to test its comfort and sound quality compared to the current microphones. If the test is successful, more of the Crown microphones will be purchased. The group also discussed the possibility of obtaining a wireless handheld microphone to pass around to those who aren't regularly miked, but this idea needs further investigation to determine compatibility with the existing system and potential issues with handling noise. Overall, the goal is to improve microphone quality and user comfort, particularly addressing concerns about the lapel microphones.\n",
    "Meilyr Rowlands and Kirsty Williams AM did not appear to be present during the meeting. There were several statements made by Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn regarding the challenges faced by secondary schools. Rowlands stated that secondary schools face a greater challenge than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum due to the phase-in approach. He acknowledged the concerns about teacher shortages, particularly at the secondary level, and the need for both short-term and long-term strategies to make teaching an attractive career option. He also mentioned that secondary schools are more qualification focused, which can be excessive.\n\nRegarding ensuring safety and support for students with emotional and mental health difficulties, Rowlands noted that pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is less at the secondary level. Rowlands also noted that secondary school students are more discerning and are more likely to notice the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and the messages that they're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons, in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on.\n\nThere was no discussion about methods to ensure safety and studying from home.\n",
    "During the detailed design discussion, the Industrial Designer, Sebastian, focused on interoperability, suggesting that one remote control should be able to control multiple devices using a modern communication method like Bluetooth, rather than the outdated infrared. While acknowledging the cost-effectiveness of infrared, he emphasized the need to move beyond older technologies.\n\nSebastian also raised questions about the remote's form factor and user interface, inquiring about alternatives to buttons, such as touchscreens or a joystick-like stick for navigation. He expressed concern about the need to always point the remote directly at the TV.\n\nFurthermore, Sebastian suggested the inclusion of a display on the remote control to show functions, potentially simplifying operation. However, he acknowledged the financial constraints of the project, recognizing that the remote wouldn't be a high-end product.\n",
    "The group has concerns regarding the potential impact of Brexit on the Erasmus program and student mobility. There is worry that if the UK doesn't remain in the Erasmus program, alternative funding mechanisms would be less efficient and more costly. They emphasize the importance of maintaining and enhancing student mobility, with some universities already planning to use their fee income to support it. They acknowledge the value and international recognition of the Erasmus brand, hoping the UK can continue to participate.\n\nThe committee does not discuss tuition fees beyond the impact of Brexit on EU students.\n",
    "The meetings covered several key areas related to education and well-being in Wales. Discussions on local authoritative frameworks centered on strategies for supporting learners at risk of exclusion, with emphasis on multi-agency collaboration and trauma-informed practices.

The committee also discussed the need for better data collection and monitoring of EOTAS provision.",
    "Anju Dhillon, a member of Parliament, expressed thanks to the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for their invaluable assistance in long-term care facilities. Dhillon stated that the observations and testimonies of these members revealed the extent of the nightmare that many seniors had endured for a long time, including starvation, abuse, and neglect. Dhillon emphasized the importance of ensuring that no elderly person is ever hurt in such a vile manner again.\n",
    "The group discussed several functions for the remote control, ultimately prioritizing a single-function remote specifically for televisions to maintain simplicity and compatibility across different brands.\n\nCharacter and design requirements included portability, user-friendliness, a trendy and sellable international design, and durability. The team explored illuminated or fluorescent buttons for visibility in the dark, with a potential alarm feature to locate a lost remote. Environmental impact was also considered, with the idea of using shape-memory alloys for easy component separation and recycling at the end of the product's life.\n\nThe scroll feature was discussed in terms of an LCD screen that might have the actual program that was on, and what was next.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion revolved around the design and functionality of a new remote control for TV distribution. Key considerations included making it user-friendly, trendy, and cost-effective. The team explored innovative features like a content-based navigation system, allowing users to choose programs by content rather than just channels. Technical challenges related to gathering program content data were identified as a primary focus for the next meeting.\n\nMarketing contributed ideas such as integrating a speech interface and a light adaptation system based on the TV picture. However, concerns were raised about the feasibility of incorporating speech recognition into a slim remote design. Marketing did not share thoughts on repetitive strain injury. The group did not discuss previous meetings and progress.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts did not contain lab test findings regarding the button design.\n\nThe group discussed the need for fewer buttons and considered on-screen navigation. The idea of a \"finder\" function for the remote was brought up, where the remote would respond to a shout or make a sound to help locate it. A speech interface was suggested for ease of use.\n\nThe team discussed the possibility of a speech interface and the ability to choose programs without adding buttons. They talked about adding a microphone to the remote control.\n\nRegarding lighting adaptive options, the team concluded that they were not of high interest to users and were complex to implement. They considered developing them for a future TV set with automatic sound and light adjustment.\n",
    "The team discussed DAT recorders and the Santa Barbara corpus, which might be helpful for transcription and adaptation to a meeting setting.\n\nRegarding power cables, the team is building a box to convert blue wires to black wires and supply power to the microphones. They discussed the number of channels needed (16) and how to distribute them around the tables, as well as the importance of an LED indicator to show when the box is live.\n\nCapturing subject intention is a complex issue. The team considered marking repairs, false starts, and filled pauses. They also discussed how to handle backchannels and overlapping speech. Jane has developed conventions for indicating non-standard pronunciations, backchannels, and the continuation of thoughts across utterances.\n\nFor analysis, the team considered commercial transcription services but found them too expensive. They also discussed the possibility of using linguistics grad students and undergrads to do the transcription, with Jane potentially coordinating the process. They explored tools like \"Transcriber\" and considered the potential of integrating speech recognition software to speed up the process.\n",
    "The group discussed the general specifications and case design of the remote control, emphasizing simplicity, fashion, and usability. Marketing suggested a design with a sliding or pull-out section to hide less frequently used buttons, catering to users who prefer a minimalist interface. This idea was positively received as a way to offer both simplicity and advanced functionality without overwhelming users. The team acknowledged the need to ensure this design wouldn't interfere with the infrared signal transmission.\n\nThe discussion also covered the importance of the remote's appearance, aligning with the company's image of \"fashion in electronics,\" and the need for a long-lasting battery. The team explored the possibility of a charging station or cradle to keep the remote in a designated place, potentially reducing the likelihood of it being lost. There was no specific discussion about changes in the current design, but rather a focus on incorporating user feedback and market trends into the new design.\n",
    "Huw David acknowledged the potential for unintended consequences if the Bill isn't implemented carefully and with sufficient resources. He stressed the importance of cultural change and the need for a major awareness-raising campaign, as well as ensuring support is available for parents who struggle with parenting.\n\nRegarding the need for legislation, he stated that physical punishment is harm to a child, and it should be prevented. He also stated that legislation should be reflective of society, where many parents no longer support physical punishment.\n\nWhen asked if the duty to raise awareness should be explicitly stated in the Bill, Huw David initially said that he wasn't sure if it was necessary, as Welsh Government would want to make a success of the Bill. However, he quickly changed his mind, stating that it should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers, as that commitment is one that he is sure will be honoured.\n",
    "The group had mixed feelings about the two-sided remote control. The industrial designer suggested that if certain features like solar cells and voice recognition were removed to lower the price to the target of twelve Euro fifty, they should consider changing the casing from rubber to plastic and possibly targeting a different, less fancy market segment, perhaps focusing on young people with different colors.\n\nIn evaluating the remote, opinions varied. The industrial designer thought a titanium housing or double-curved case (which was not used to allow for solar) would have made it fancier. The voice recognition feature was seen as innovative but difficult to learn. Ease of use was rated between a two and three.\n\nRegarding technical requirements, the discussion touched upon the moldability of the casing, with one participant noting a \"spongy option\" in the market. The ability to adapt signals from other remotes was mentioned as a powerful feature, compensating for the limited number of buttons. Overall, the group felt they had developed a good product, but its market fit and price point were questionable.\n",
    "In group 3, the discussions centered on the regulation-making powers in the Bill, particularly concerning the commencement of section 1. The Deputy Minister sought to add existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent.\n\nSuzy Davies introduced amendment 3A as a \"probing amendment,\" questioning whether the \"transitory, transitional and saving provisions\" were sufficient for implementing section 1, especially given the planned awareness campaign and report. She suggested the Deputy Minister consider amending the Bill to grant more unrestricted power to make regulations. Davies emphasized the need for the Assembly to have an opportunity to scrutinize any measures introduced under section 1. Davies said that while she completely accepted that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on, it's still possible to do that without procedure. She held this position, in anticipation of the rejection of amendments in group 1. She expressed openness to discussing the type of powers needed before Stage 3. The Deputy Minister did not think wider powers were necessary but agreed to keep the matter under review and discuss it further before Stage 3.\n",
    "The provided meeting transcripts do not contain information about the impact of Brexit on higher education fee and access plans in Wales, nor do they detail any specific measures taken by executives to plan for Brexit and protect students' interests in that context.\n\nRegarding the local production of PPE, there are mentions of Novo Textiles, a company in Surrey Centre, that retooled its factory to produce surgical masks and soon N95 masks using Canadian designs and machinery. The government has contracts with Medicom in Montreal for N95 mask production and with General Motors for surgical masks. However, there is questioning about whether the government is truly committed to growing domestic production capacity or if it is just \"talk and no action.\"\n\nThere is no specific update on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada mentioned in the transcripts.\n",
    "I am sorry, but the provided meeting transcripts do not contain any information regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada. The meeting focused on education in Wales, specifically school improvement, standards, and the performance of the education system. The discussion included the involvement of organizations like the OECD and Estyn, the use of school categorisation systems, and the Pupil Development Grant, none of which is about the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada.\n",
    "The marketing expert is enthusiastic about the product, stating that the design team gave them more marketable features than expected. They specifically like the base station with the \"where's my remote\" button.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective, they suggest using silvers and blacks for the product's color scheme to match most televisions. They believe the product has the features, characteristics, and background to be marketable at a competitive cost of thirty-five to fifty Euros, creating a market niche.\n\nThe expert suggests offering a lifetime guarantee on the product, covering technical problems. They also propose exploring the possibility of making the unit upgradable, although this could impact the warranty concept. The expert hopes that even if the remote doesn't work for every device, customers will keep it due to its other appealing features.\n",
    "The main points discussed regarding the Welsh baccalaureate included its perceived value by learners and teachers, its potential advantages, and weaknesses.\n\nOn the topic of value, the Cabinet Secretary stated that it helps provide a broad and balanced curriculum, preparing students for further study and work. Learners reported positive experiences, and universities value it, especially since it became a graded qualification. However, negative feedback included concerns about balancing the Welsh bac with other qualifications and potential negative impacts on student well-being.\n\nAdvantages mentioned were the development of skills valued by employers and universities, and the preparation for university-level research. The main weaknesses were inconsistency in delivery across schools, leading to variability in the value learners attach to it. Concerns were also raised about the workload for teachers, the need for greater employer engagement, and perceptions of a lack of rigor. Some believe students are leaving Wales to avoid it. There was disagreement about how universities value the qualification.\n",
    "The group discussed evaluation criteria focusing on aesthetics, usability, and innovation. For aesthetics, they considered a \"beautiful\" vs. \"fancy\" look, aiming for an iPod-like design rather than excessive flashing lights. Color choices were discussed, considering company colors (black and white) and potentially changeable fronts for personalization.\n\nUsability was evaluated based on ease of use and learnability. The team felt the remote was easy to use initially, but the second layer functions and speech recognition might be harder to learn. The scroll wheel was seen as handy but potentially requiring a learning curve.\n\nInnovation was assessed by comparing the remote to existing devices. The team highlighted features like different colored lighting, changeable fronts, and new features, acknowledging the absence of games or an LCD screen. They debated whether the design would appeal to their target audience (young adults under 40). The team also considered the cost of components and the possibility of adding a home station.\n",
    "The participants did not favor using CDs as a reliable backup solution due to their short lifespan, with burned CDs potentially failing within a year and generally lasting only a few years. They considered tape backups a more reliable long-term archiving solution.\n\nRegarding probability computation, the discussion centered on likelihoods obtained from PLP versus mel cepstrum features in the SRI system. It was noted that likelihoods couldn't be directly compared due to normalization. The group was also determining how to handle pruning and beam search thresholds, with a preference for conservative pruning.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system involved a \"wizard of oz\" approach. One person interacted with what they believed was a computer, while a hidden person simulated the computer's responses. Halfway through the session, the participant was told they were now interacting with a human, though it was the same person, allowing for the collection of both human-computer and human-human interaction data. The group discussed saving far-field microphone data from these sessions for acoustic studies.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not provide any information about the group deciding against positioning symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating both right-handed and left-handed remotes. The User Interface team member agreed with the idea, but the Marketing team member questioned the practicality, wondering if families with both left- and right-handed individuals would need to have two remotes. The Industrial Designer noted that people adapt to using right-handed computer mice regardless of their dominant hand and felt it wouldn't be too difficult to use the remote with either hand. Ultimately, the team did not come to a consensus on whether to pursue the idea of right- and left-handed remotes, but the Project Manager seemed generally positive about the overall design.\n",
    "The group discussed cost reduction strategies to meet the \u20ac12.50 production cost target. The project manager proposed removing speech recognition and offering customizable covers to cut costs. This would allow delivery of a basic black remote with core functions, while users could purchase separate covers for customization. \n\nHowever, the user interface designer disagreed, emphasizing the importance of trendiness. The industrial designer raised concerns about needing different button frames for different cover colors. The team acknowledged the appeal of the rubber material for its \"squishy feel\" and durability, aligning with marketing research. Ultimately, they decided to eliminate speech recognition and the special color to meet the budget. \n\nThey also considered the implications of these changes on the product's style and functionality, weighing the benefits of features like the LCD display against their cost. The group explored the possibility of using plastic for the basic cover material, but the \"squishy feel\" of the rubber was determined to be an important feature. The final decision was to retain the rubber and curve, and to remove the special color and speech recognition.\n",
    "The meeting participants discussed voice recognition as a potential feature for the remote control.\n\n**Pros:**\n*   Market research indicated that a significant portion of the target demographic (young professionals, ages 15-35) were willing to spend more money for intuitive controls like voice recognition.\n*   Voice recognition could appeal to people with physical disabilities.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   The user interface designer noted that current voice recognition technology isn't amazing and can be frustrating to use, requiring users to yell at the device.\n*   Voice recognition could be expensive to implement.\n*   There was concern that focusing on voice recognition as a technology could distract from the primary goal of creating a simple and easy-to-use product.\n*   The industrial designer suggested prioritizing the functions that need to be fulfilled first, and then deciding if voice recognition is the best way to achieve those functions.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer (ID) suggested using a battery for the remote control to avoid a wired connection. The ID mentioned that the remote control wouldn't need much power to function. They also agreed with the User Interface (UI) designer's idea that people with PDAs could use them to control the TV, but the primary goal was to sell the remote control. The marketing team didn't discuss the type of batteries, conservation of battery life, or the use of triple-A batteries.\n\nThere was no mention of the Industrial Designer recommending a charger instead of a battery.\n",
    "The reasons for including the project in a conference paper included the following:\n\n*   **Documenting Progress:** It would document the team's thinking and progress on the Bayes-net and related work.\n*   **Exploring an Idea:** It would allow the team to explore an idea and get feedback.\n*   **No harm in trying:** The team believed that there was no harm in writing up a paper, even if it gets rejected.\n*   **Opportunity to introduce the formalism:** The paper could be a chance to introduce the new formalism that the team was developing.\n*   **Potential for interesting results:** The team was curious to see what the ad-hoc process of designing a belief-net would produce and whether it would lead to interesting questions and answers.\n*   **Highlighting complexity:** The paper could highlight the complexity of seemingly simple statements like \"where is the blah-blah\" and challenge existing approaches in the field.",
    "Kirsty Williams believed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of a civic mission and that any legislation should empower the commission to enable that through its regulatory and funding powers. She wanted to ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector.\n\nRegarding university governance, Kirsty Williams acknowledged that the 2015 Act did not directly address governance issues. She sought a more direct relationship with university chairs and supported an independent review of governance by Universities Wales and HEFCW. She was exploring how the new Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance.\n\nKirsty Williams did not directly address university mergers in the provided text.\n\nThe discussions within the group regarding admission problems in Wales universities and the proposed solutions are not addressed in the text.\n",
    "The team discussed and evaluated the remote prototype based on ease of use, fashion, feel, and technological innovation using a seven-point scale. While the prototype's form was well-received, its ease of use was questioned. The team agreed the voice recognition feature added technological innovation, but its limitation to TV functionality was a concern.\n\nFor the energy source, the team decided against a hand dynamo and opted for a battery. After discussion, a lithium battery was chosen over AAA batteries, as the target demographic was deemed technologically advanced.\n\nOverall, the team was satisfied with the project process, praising the creativity allowed within the confines of a TV remote. Teamwork and the technology used were also viewed positively. The team felt the final product was marketable and within budget.\n",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the TV remote project. For the energy source, they considered batteries, hand dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar cells, ultimately leaning towards kinetic energy generated by squeezing the remote. They decided against using the newly developed sample sensor/speaker due to cost and questionable functionality.\n\nRegarding technical issues, they decided to use simple push-buttons instead of a more expensive chip-on-print, advanced chip. They also explored the possibility of Bluetooth connectivity but acknowledged the need for compatible televisions, which don't currently exist.\n\nThe team agreed to a rubber case, prioritizing its anti-RSI properties. They also discussed the look and feel, and the industrial designer will be working on the look and feel design.\n\nThe project announcement email was briefly mentioned at the end of the meeting as a way to ensure everyone is aware of their tasks.\n",
    "In the last meeting, the team discussed key features and design elements for a new remote control. The marketing manager presented her approach of gathering ideas and studying competitors to create an attractive and budget-friendly product.\n\nThe technical manager suggested features like an infrared chip, interface controls, child lock, and a display clock. The interface designer emphasized the importance of an attractive and user-friendly interface, suggesting features like channel swapping, volume control, subtitles, and voice recognition.\n\nThe industrial designer focused on the components and technical aspects, including the case material, coloring, and electronic components like chips, resistors, capacitors, and batteries. They also discussed the possibility of using a rechargeable battery and different button types, such as push-buttons versus scroll wheels.\n\nA major problem was the debate around voice recognition, with concerns about its cost and reliability. The team decided to research the feasibility of voice recognition further and explore other features like speech recognition. They decided to work together on a prototype using modeling clay.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns about the childcare offer. One key issue was the \u00a34.50 single national rate, with Hefin David questioning its suitability for more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport, suggesting it might lead to a two-tiered system where wealthier parents can afford better care through add-ons. He also highlighted the potential impact on lower-income working families who might struggle with additional costs for items like transport and food.\n\nBoth also discussed the affordability and the financial implications of the program, and the capacity for the sector to grow and deliver the product.\n\nHefin David also questioned workforce qualification and quality, and if a 10-year workforce development plan would be enough to meet the needs of the sector.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line normalization centered on PhD C's work on training it with two different means (one for silence, one for speech) controlled by voice activity detection. He observed strange behavior with C-one, where the mean for the silence portion differed based on the type of noise. He also experimented with a time constant that adapts more quickly at the beginning of utterances. Professor B suggested analyzing the types of errors to see if improvements in some areas are offset by regressions in others.\n\nRegarding phase normalization, PhD F tried a long-term mean subtraction approach but got \"garbage results.\" Grad G experimented with unwrapping the phase (since phases are added modulo two pi) but also saw worse results. He suggested working with complex numbers and dividing out the average complex spectrum instead of subtracting in the log domain. He also mentioned the importance of scaling numbers appropriately when taking logs due to the Taylor expansion.\n\nThere was no discussion of quals.\n",
    "The discussion centered on detecting important linguistic features for improved speech recognition. Different feature streams were explored, including OGI features and low-pass filtered cepstrum. A \"combo\" system was described, which combines features through a network and MLP's, with a KLT transformation. The team considered using a second silence detection, but delay issues on the server side made it infeasible for immediate implementation. The potential advantage of using Noisy-ORs was not specifically mentioned in the provided text. The inclusion of silence as a feature in the transcription formalization was discussed, particularly in the context of MLP outputs and KLT transformations. The team explored different architectures, including one with a single KLT, and considered weighting schemes to evaluate performance across different datasets.\n",
    "The meeting covered several topics related to system involvement. Grad H discussed using THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, including indexing and querying. The group discussed the user interface, with options including porting Dan's Tcl-TK THISL GUI or merging it with the Transcriber interface. There was also discussion of demoing prosody work.\n\nOn backups, Dave Johnson advised against using non-backed-up disks for Meeting Recorder data, suggesting NW archive for copies and relying on the new backup system.\n\nThe group discussed using CrossPads for note-taking during meetings, but concerns were raised about infrastructure, synchronization, noise, and lack of use. Professor B suggested getting someone to commit to using them for a series of meetings. There was also a PDA idea that was brought up. Professor B suggested that the CrossPad should be returned.\n",
    "The discussion regarding HMRC focused on the Welsh Government's decision to suspend its work with them concerning the delivery of the childcare offer. Sian Gwenllian expressed frustration, highlighting the committee's previous scrutiny and concerns, suggesting that \u00a31 million had been unnecessarily spent.\n\nJulie Morgan stated that the primary reason for ending the collaboration was the desire for greater flexibility and the ability to expand the offer beyond what HMRC could accommodate. She mentioned that including training and education within the offer wouldn't be possible through HMRC, necessitating local authority involvement. While technical issues related to Welsh language standards were also a factor, Morgan emphasized that the need for flexibility was a major driver.\n\nJo-anne Daniels added that the costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than initially outlined. The Welsh Government concluded that working with local authorities would be cheaper and allow investment to stay within Wales.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, here's a summary of Professor C's comments and the team's feedback:\n\n*   **Workshop:** Professor C mentioned that he was just talking about speech energy with Jose. He also recommended that the new student, Don, do the overall thing.\n*   **Person in Grenada:** There were no comments in this transcript on the person in Grenada.\n*   **New Form Arrangement:** The discussion revolved around the new digit form and the speaker form. The main point was whether to have the \"Region\" field as a fill-in blank or a list of regions. Professor C was confused by the \"Northern\" region option.\n*   **Belief Net Structure:** There were no comments in this transcript on the belief net structure.\n*   **Grad B's Opinion on Belief Net Structure:** There were no comments in this transcript on Grad B's opinion on the belief net structure.",
    "Grad E's experiments focused on mean log magnitude spectral subtraction for the SmartKom system. They tested different window lengths for calculating the mean and found that using a 12-second window from the past and present frames resulted in only a slight performance drop compared to a centered window. They also explored the impact of training models with a 12-second window but testing with shorter windows, observing a minor performance decrease. Grad E aimed to determine the importance of the models used and the time used to calculate the mean during training.\n\nGrad A was not mentioned in the excerpt.",
    "The User Interface (UI) expert favored using radio waves for the remote control due to their ability to transmit signals without needing to be directly pointed at the TV. They believed potential interference with other appliances could be avoided by using a specific frequency range that doesn't require special permission. A solution for interference between multiple remotes in close proximity, like in neighboring homes, was suggested: implementing a password or identification code within the signal.\n\nHowever, the industrial designer expressed a preference for sticking with infrared (IR) technology due to its simplicity and lower cost, estimating radio wave technology to be three to five times more expensive. The marketing representative noted that users prioritize the look and feel of the remote over the specific type of wave technology used.\n\nUltimately, a final decision on the wave technology was not explicitly stated in the provided text. The team did decide to incorporate an LCD screen and minimize the number of buttons, potentially hiding less frequently used settings behind a cover or within the LCD menus. The potential inclusion of speech recognition was discussed, with the UI expert being in favor of the feature.\n",
    "The professor discussed the impact of noise, particularly low-frequency noise like that from an air conditioner, on speech signals. He mentioned a digital filter to address this, emphasizing that it doesn't affect speech frequencies significantly, with a mild effect possibly up to 100 Hz. He highlighted the importance of high-pass filtering, especially when using cheaper microphones, and noted that their software often includes this option.\n\nRegarding reverberation, he suggested alternative ways to visualize its effects, such as spectral slices or cepstral analysis, as spectrograms can be too easily interpreted by the human eye. He also touched upon spectral subtraction, noting that while it can increase the difference between speech and noise, it may also increase the variance of C-zero.\n\nThe professor also raised the idea of having a second stream of information based on fine-structure analysis, looking at harmonicity, to complement the envelope-based stream. He suggested using this information to create a probability of voicing, which could then be integrated with the other stream.\n",
    "The group discussed making the remote easy to hold, thin, and accessible with either hand. The primary function buttons would be placed on top for thumb use, with the menu accessible with the other hand.\n\nRegarding aesthetics, the team considered appealing to a broad audience with basic colors like white or metallic grey, offering exchangeable covers for younger users who might prefer brighter colors. There was a debate on whether to make flashy colors standard or an extra feature, with the consensus leaning towards offering fruity colors as standard while providing more sophisticated options for those willing to pay extra.\n\nThe kinetic function was discussed but ultimately considered too expensive. There was also a discussion on whether to include a rechargeable battery or sell covers with a docking station. A key design decision was whether to have a double-curved or single-curved design, with the double-curved design adding aesthetic value but also increasing costs.\n",
    "The team's proposed design for implementing demographic marketing strategies wasn't explicitly detailed, but it involves researching existing remote control designs and identifying what draws consumers to a product. The consensus is that the product needs a new, appealing design that is simple to use.\n\nRegarding the appearance design presentations, there was no explicit agreement between Industrial Design and Marketing; however, the Project Manager emphasized the need for Industrial Design (Christine) and Marketing (Ed) to collaborate closely on the design and sales plan.\n\nThe Industrial Designer suggested that the product needs to be fashionable and attractive, similar to an iPod, to immediately appeal to consumers, regardless of its functionality.\n\nMarketing's opinion on the marketable aspect of the product design is that it must be new and visually appealing, drawing people in with its design before considering its functionality. They also emphasized the importance of simplicity in usability.\n",
    "Grad G's opinions are not mentioned in the provided meeting transcripts.\n\nProfessor B thought that Fey's suggestion that the system should introduce itself when called was a good idea.\n\nThe professor and Grad D both agreed that the wizard (Litonya) did a wonderful job in the experiment. The professor thought Litonya was more present and did a better job than he would have guessed from just talking to her. Grad D also stated that Litonya responded nicely to things that were not asked for.\n\nRegarding capturing the subject's intention, Grad A stated, \"...we have the concept of what their intention was, whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever.\" Professor B agreed with this statement.\n\nGrad D mentioned that the subjects were mispronouncing everything. It is not clear if Professor B agreed with this statement.\n\nMSG is not mentioned in the provided meeting transcripts.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, the Industrial Designer seemed primarily focused on practical aspects of the remote control's design, particularly concerning usability and adaptability.\n\nRegarding appearance, the designer suggested the possibility of changing colors, similar to phones, for visual appeal. They also considered size, suggesting it shouldn't be too big and that the number of buttons should be limited.\n\nThe Industrial Designer did not comment on the technology of speech recognition.\n\nIn terms of technology and functionality, the Industrial Designer considered the possibility of a touch screen remote control. They also explored the idea of adapting the design for both left-handed and right-handed users, suggesting the use of two switches with one being adaptable for either hand. The designer also mentioned the possibility of using only one button to change channels.\n",
    "The meeting transcript primarily focused on education standards in Wales, with discussions revolving around inspection priorities, the curriculum, and support for schools. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders agreed that regional consortia should be prioritized to support curriculum reform.\n\nThe transcript does not include discussions on the reopening of the House of Commons in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations. Also, there is no mention of Justin Trudeau or any elaboration on governmental funds or his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions when discussing the allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism.\n",
    "The group's discussion centered on defining the functional and technical design of a new remote control. The functional design aims to identify user needs, while the technical design focuses on how the remote will fulfill those needs. Conceptual design involves specifying components and user interface trends.\n\nSpecific design requirements included user-friendliness, originality, and trendiness. The number of buttons was discussed, with a preference for fewer buttons. The idea of backlighting the buttons for use in the dark was considered. The remote's shape was also addressed, with a suggestion to avoid a boxy design.\n\nDurability was a concern, with the need for shock resistance mentioned. The possibility of a waterproof remote control for use in the bathroom was explored, along with the option of including plastic protection. A \"find my remote\" feature, where a button on the TV would make the remote beep, was suggested.\n\nThe marketing perspective emphasized the importance of bundling the remote with other products if it's a single-device remote, otherwise, it should be programmable for multiple devices.\n",
    "The team's initial discussion focused on familiarizing themselves with the meeting room's tools, particularly the whiteboard, through a lighthearted exercise of drawing animals. However, the conversation quickly shifted to the project's financial aspects, specifically the target selling price of twenty-five euros for the remote control and the desired profit margin of fifty million euros.\n\nThe user interface designer questioned whether the remote control would be a standalone unit or specific to a device, raising concerns about the product's nature and market fit within the specified price range. They suggested that determining what people are willing to pay for a remote control is essential. The project manager acknowledged this concern, assigning market research to the marketing team for a future meeting. The immediate tasks assigned to the team members included working on the design, technical functions, and user requirement specifications.\n",
    "The discussion on future directions involved several approaches. One was connecting the system to the OGI system and exploring multi-band processing. There was also discussion of exploring articulatory targets and combining multi-band approaches with noise-robust training. PhD D explained the multilingual model, noting that training on French and Spanish seemed to hurt performance compared to using only multi-English data (TIMIT). PhD C and the professor discussed the language dependency of the models. They questioned whether the language dependency was actually an alignment problem because TIMIT was hand-labeled.\n\nThere was no discussion about releasing meeting data and allowing people to cut things out.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement highlights a discrepancy between the creation of programs and their actual implementation, specifically regarding support for single parents and their children who rely on spousal support and child maintenance. She points out that despite the Minister of Employment being aware of this issue for three weeks, no concrete action has been taken to address the gap, leaving this vulnerable group without adequate assistance during the pandemic. This suggests a problem with the efficiency or effectiveness of the government's response, where programs are designed but fail to reach all intended beneficiaries in a timely manner.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, the Project Manager does not share any views on a past meeting review or market research. The Project Manager also does not reflect on the contents of any presentations. The group does not appear to have a different opinion than the Project Manager when reflecting on the previous meetings and project progress. The marketing team member mentioned wanting to draw a panther, finding it fast, black, powerful, and memorable from childhood. However, the industrial designer questioned the ease of drawing a panther.\n",
    "The team had varying opinions on the remote control's features. Marketing strongly advocated for an LCD screen, citing research indicating its popularity among younger users (16-20 years old), but the project manager expressed concerns about the cost. The industrial designer emphasized the importance of basic remote control functions, such as the power button and LED sender.\n\nRegarding button placement, there was a discussion on minimizing RSI by strategically positioning frequently used buttons like power, channel, and volume near the thumb. The user interface designer suggested channel-changing buttons on the side, similar to a Gameboy, while the industrial designer proposed keeping less frequently used buttons out of easy reach. The team also debated the inclusion of a \"go to video\" button, with differing opinions on its relevance. They agreed that the design phase would involve individual work, followed by a consensus-building process.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the closure of provincial and international borders to recreational travel. This resulted in tourism operators being among the first and hardest hit by government-mandated lockdowns, especially seasonal and rural operations, and affected the 1.8 million people employed in the industry.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, the government took some measures, such as acknowledging Tourism Week in Canada to recognize the contributions of the tourism industry, but the transcripts do not provide details of significant action being taken.\n",
    "The meeting focused on the design of a new remote control. The discussion covered functional, conceptual, and detailed design aspects. Key considerations included making it waterproof and baby-proof, with a debate on whether it should be a universal remote or a targeted one. Size, color, robustness, and ease of use were identified as important factors.\n\nParticipants discussed the placement of buttons, particularly the off button, and explored the idea of a touch screen. The team also considered whether the remote should cater to both right-handed and left-handed users. The number of actions needed was debated, with options ranging from three buttons for basic functions to more for a universal remote. Recording sequences of actions was suggested, but deemed complex.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a plan to reconvene in thirty minutes, with the goal of refining the discussed ideas and deciding on the most important features for the remote control design.\n",
    "The group discussed preparations for a DARPA meeting in mid-July and the need to be in \"production mode\" by then, with a functional stream and knowledge of its performance. They aim to have a subset of transcribed data available for public use by the meeting.\n\nRegarding the contents of a paper, preliminary results from training classifiers using both word and prosodic features were discussed. These features are used to determine things like sentence boundaries, disfluency boundaries, and potential interruptions.\n\nThe paper includes statistics on meeting data collected (62 hours as of mid-May) and the number of transcribers (aiming for a staff of five or six). The analysis of prosodic features showed that some features expressing the distance of boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local pitch range effects were showing up in the classifiers. Pitch features were found to be better than in Switchboard due to close-talking microphones.\n",
    "The group agreed to train and test the digits corpus using various techniques, including PLP, MSG, and MFCC, with online normalization and delta coefficients. They found that delta coefficients significantly improved performance. However, cross-language experiments showed that nets trained on French or Spanish were not as effective as those trained on multi-English. They also experimented with combining feature streams using multiple MLPs and KLT transforms.\n\nThe current technique's limitations included issues with MSG features, particularly in mismatched conditions, and a language and noise dependency where neural nets trained on specific conditions performed worse when tested on different conditions. The group made progress in identifying TIMIT as a strong training set, but faced delays due to the need to redo experiments with PLP and delta coefficients, and the complexity of combining different features and training sets. The MSG process was also found to have some unknown issues.\n",
    "The provided transcript does not contain any discussion regarding the advantages of \"triple R\" over \"triple RC\" in relation to the product's name. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the text.\n\nHowever, the meeting concluded that the target age group should be young professionals, specifically those between 15 and 35 years old. This decision was based on the fact that this demographic is more likely to have disposable income to spend on such gadgets. Also, they are more likely to be familiar with and comfortable using technology like voice recognition.\n\nThe marketing team decided to target young people because they are considered more gadget-oriented. These are people who grew up with computers and mobile phones, making them more receptive to new technology.\n\nThe team also discussed categorizing controls into three groups. These are device functions (like on/off), audio settings (volume, bass), and visual settings. This categorization aimed to make the remote control more intuitive and user-friendly by grouping related functions together.\n",
    "The group discussed market research indicating user dissatisfaction with current remote controls. A key finding was that 50% of users only utilize 10% of the buttons, while 80% would pay more for a stylish remote. This led to a desire for a streamlined design with fewer buttons, focusing on essential functions like power, channel, and volume. Speech recognition was considered, especially for younger demographics (91% of 15-25 year olds would pay more), but its cost and practicality were questioned.\n\nDesign opinions varied, but there was a consensus on reducing clutter and improving usability. The team explored different materials, button sizes/positioning, and overall shape, aiming for a \"revolutionized\" remote control. A rechargeable internal battery was suggested as a selling point, potentially addressing the issue of remotes being easily lost. The necessity of a complete overhaul of remote control interaction was debated. The team considered focusing on simplicity and ease of use.\n",
    "I am sorry, but Kirsty Williams AM was not present at these meetings. Therefore, I cannot answer your question about her plan for quality assurance, her five principles, or her response to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions.\n\nHowever, Bethan Owen did comment on the high-risk category, stating that maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students and investing in the research portfolio are key to preventing universities from falling into that category. The attractiveness of Welsh universities to students and investment in the research portfolio need to be maintained.\n\nRegarding expectations for new examinations and school qualifications, this topic was not discussed in the provided transcripts.\n",
    "The team generally liked the final product's aesthetics and potential marketability. The marketing team member felt they did a good job with the project and that they had control over what they wanted to do with the remote, and liked that they had say over how technologically advanced and fashionable it should be. There was also a consensus that the team worked well together and found the digital pens, laptops, and shared network to be useful tools.\n\nHowever, there were also some dislikes. The industrial designer felt that the company stifled creativity by restricting them to a TV remote. One team member questioned the remote's limited functionality, expressing concern that it only worked for TVs. Another concern was the initial prototype's feel and ease of use, with one member giving it a low rating due to its current state.\n",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments centered around its potential impact on word error rate and signal-to-noise ratio. It was observed that mean subtraction seemed to make PZM signals louder after re-synthesis, raising questions about whether it was acting as a form of gain control. Concerns were raised about how mean subtraction, involving averages over multiple windows, could introduce artifacts or reverberation-like effects, especially in low-energy sections. It was also suggested that mean subtraction could improve signal-to-noise ratio, potentially by normalizing for spikes caused by events like hitting a table. The discussion also touched on the possibility of missing normalization steps and the need to ensure consistent normalization across training and testing data.\n",
    "The discussion included mixed signals from Aurora participants on how to weight error rates from different languages and conditions, with some suggesting combining error rates before computing improvement and others favoring the opposite. A new baseline potentially including a VAD was proposed, aiming for a 50% improvement. There was no decision on whose VAD to use.\n\nPhD student A and PhD student F worked on VAD improvements by exploring features for voicing detection, experimenting with the spectrum of excitation and statistical models. Postdoc A did not give an opinion of new headphones. An alternative method to increase space was to re-synthesize audio after reverberation removal, allowing the use of existing feature calculation code. The next Aurora deadline is in June.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, special schools do not appear to be specifically mentioned in the context of the new purpose arrangement. The discussion is centered around the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) and its allocation, primarily focusing on mainstream schools.\n\nThe role of schools with PDG for looked-after children is to strategically deploy resources to support these children, either through individual allocations or capacity building for the whole system. The regional consortia play a role in the strategic deployment of resources and capacity building.\n\nThe regional consortia are responsible for challenging and supporting schools in their use of PDG. They are expected to ask schools how they are using their PDG and how they are demonstrating an impact for those resources. Regional consortia also provide training for teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder.\n",
    "The prototype remote control was introduced with a focus on its design, featuring a power button, mute button, a joystick, and the company logo. The design included a yellow rubber component. The discussion revolved around evaluating the prototype based on marketing strategy, current trends, and user preferences.\n\nConcerns were raised about the design's appeal to a younger market due to its yellow color. Alternative materials like plastic and wood were considered, along with features such as a scroll-wheel and an LCD display. The potential for using only plastic or rubber and replacing the joystick with up, down, right, and left buttons was also discussed. The type of chip, either advanced for the LCD or regular for the joystick, was also discussed in relation to cost.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer commented on several aspects of the remote control's design. Regarding appearance and structure, they suggested a departure from the typical flat, long remote, proposing a hand-shaped design for better ergonomics. They also explored different shapes and the use of primary colors, particularly if an LCD screen was not included. The designer considered scroll wheels for navigation but questioned their ease of use, suggesting a joystick as a potentially better alternative.\n\nRegarding customer preferences, the designer mentioned research indicating that younger, trend-conscious consumers are drawn to unconventional themes, such as fruits and vegetables, for various products. They also emphasized the need to balance trendy designs with durability, particularly concerning the casing to prevent breakage if dropped. The designer also noted the need to decide between the hand-shaped remote control with scroll and without LCD.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal the following:\n\n**Allocation of $75 Million:** Karen Vecchio raised concerns about the whereabouts of the $75 million allocated towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking, noting that some organizations had to close their doors. The Minister for Women and Gender Equality responded that hundreds of organizations have received support and more announcements are forthcoming. She also mentioned that funds are being distributed through Feminists Deliver and that additional funds will be provided to organizations like Battered Women's Support Services.\n\n**Solution to Risk Appetite:** There was no discussion of the solution to risk appetite.\n\n**Hon. Chrystia Freeland's Perspective on Systemic Racism:** While systemic racism was not explicitly mentioned, Freeland addressed the issue of long-term care for seniors, acknowledging the appalling conditions revealed by the Canadian Armed Forces. She emphasized the need for careful and urgent cooperation with provincial partners to ensure that the heart-wrenching reports lead to meaningful change in how care for elders is provided in Canada.\n",
    "The segmenter, presumably Thilo's segmenter, is working well with high recall. It is being used to generate automatic segmentations for meeting recognition experiments, which is a shift from previous experiments that relied on hand-segmentations. The team plans to use the segmenter's output, including the over-generated segments, to train noise models in the recognizer. One issue that was fixed was the addition of beeps and digits at the beginning of each utterance to help the transcribers. A sample meeting has been sent to the transcribers with Thilo's segmentation to see if it resolves the problem of too many beeps in the last transcription.",
    "Based on the meeting transcript:\n\n*   **Price Disagreement:** The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer disagreed on the price during the interactive evaluation because the design exceeded the budget of twelve Euro fifty. The discussion revolved around cutting features like the scroll wheel and special colors to reduce costs.\n*   **Redesign Disagreement:** The User Interface Designer disagreed on the redesign after the product evaluation because they had to scrap the scroll wheel, which was a feature they were excited about.\n*   **Color Suggestion:** The User Interface Designer suggested yellow and red as basic colors, but the reason is unclear.\n*   **Shape Disagreement:** The marketing team disagreed with the User Interface Designer on the shape of the product because of the single curve design. The marketing team was concerned about the weight distribution with the batteries and other components located at the top of the remote, potentially making it feel heavy and unwieldy.",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil expressed reservations about the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment.\n\nDafydd Evans believes employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac and suggests that the \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" title is more helpful. He advocates for employer involvement in reviewing and shaping the qualification to enhance employability skills.\n\nKay Martin finds that employers prioritize core qualifications (e.g., engineering certifications) alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. She notes that while the Welsh bac can be helpful, other programs engage employers more effectively, suggesting a need to integrate these various initiatives.\n\nNick Brazil acknowledged the good initial vision for the Welsh bac, but feels it has become overly bureaucratic and focused on outcomes rather than skills development. He questions whether the qualification is truly developing the skills employers require and suggests that existing enhanced programs may be more effective.\n",
    "The team explored several additional ideas and presented detailed designs for the product's functionality and working prototype.\n\nThe remote features a scroll wheel for channel zapping, volume controls, a numeric keypad, enter and program buttons. The white area is plastic, and the red area is rubber for durability. A \"where's my remote\" locator button was added to the cradle.\n\nA debated \"trigger\" button on the side was considered but ultimately discarded due to concerns about accidental activation. The team discussed potential issues with the scroll wheel being accidentally rotated if the remote landed on it.\n\nMarketing suggested silver and black colors to match televisions and proposed a lifetime guarantee for the product. An idea to make the unit upgradable with a card was raised, but the risk of making it unusable or less straightforward was noted. The team discussed the production costs, aiming for a competitive price between 35 to 50 Euros. The team also reviewed the product's features, characteristics, and corporate background.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, the Project Manager believes that the selling price for the remote should be around twenty-five Euro, with a production cost of no more than twenty and a half Euro. Given these cost constraints, they don't think a \"very high tech, high definition, ultra-modern\" remote is feasible. They estimate a sales target of two million remotes.\n\nRegarding the features proposed by Marketing, the Project Manager emphasizes the importance of focusing on features that \"really add something to the current market\" while also maintaining user-friendliness. While open to innovative ideas, they caution against losing sight of practicality and must not lose sight of the user-friendly aspect.\n\nThe Project Manager acknowledges the potential benefits of a multi-purpose remote control, recognizing that it could add a new feature to the market and differentiate the product. However, it is important to first agree on what they're going to make before designing the technical functions. The Project Manager wants each person to individually think about what, from their point of view, is the most important.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, User Interface (UI) did not directly address the cost constraints or financial targets of the project. However, they did mention the possibility of using a small speaker, noting that the speaker would be small.\n\nRegarding the kinetic batteries, there was no discussion of kinetic batteries, so User Interface gave no thoughts on replacing them.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, disagreements arose between Marketing and the Industrial Designer regarding the practicality and marketability of certain features.\n\nSpecifically, Marketing questioned the use of kinetic energy, with concerns that elderly users wouldn't want to shake the remote to power it. The Industrial Designer seemed to favor the idea, but Marketing prioritized ease of use and customer preference based on market research.\n\nAdditionally, there was a discussion about making the product upgradable with changeable cases. While the Project Manager and Marketing saw this as a unique selling point and a way to extend the product's lifespan and appeal, the Industrial Designer did not seem to have an opinion, but it would affect the design. The core of the disagreement stemmed from balancing innovative features with the needs and preferences of the target demographic while remaining cost-effective.\n",
    "The provided meeting transcript does not contain discussions or decisions regarding HEFCW's powers of intervention, including the current situation and conversations with FE and HE about closure decisions. The meeting focused on various topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, including petitions, statements by members, questions to ministers on topics such as financial aid, support for specific sectors, long-term care, and international relations, but HEFCW was not mentioned.\n",
    "The marketing strategy revolves around creating a fashionable, user-friendly universal remote control with a target selling price of twenty-five Euros. To achieve the projected profit of fifty million Euros, the team plans to focus on a sleek design and high-quality materials to differentiate it from cheaper alternatives.\n\nThe remote will have multi-format capabilities, and the team is considering a touch screen interface and potentially a locator device to address the common problem of losing remotes. They'll investigate integrating additional functionalities, such as controlling other devices like microwaves, while being mindful of user-friendliness and avoiding overwhelming the design with too many features. The marketing approach will also take into account the target demographic, considering the preferences of both tech-savvy users and those accustomed to traditional button-based remotes.\n",
    "The discussion focused on addressing childhood obesity through a multi-faceted approach. Regarding policies, there was debate on setting targets for obesity reduction, with concerns about achievability versus aspiration. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) was open to suggestions about having a target.

    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design for the remote control to enhance user comfort and usability. The single curve design was needed to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position, so it rested on the top of the hand. The ergonomic design with a rubber grip aimed to mold to the user's hand, offering a comfortable feel.\n\nThe agreement on \"easy to use,\" \"fashion,\" \"easy to find,\" and \"robust\" features stemmed from Real Reactions' goals, marketing strategies, and user requirements. \"Easy to use\" ensured accessibility for all users. \"Fashion\" aligned with the company's strategy to incorporate current clothing trends into electronics. \"Easy to find\" addressed the common problem of lost remotes, although this feature was ultimately cut due to budget constraints. \"Robust\" ensured the product's durability.\n\nThe fashion style of the remote control was evaluated based on current trends, specifically fruit and vegetable patterns popular in clothing. The initial prototype was yellow, likened to a banana, but the team acknowledged it wasn't particularly fruit or vegetable-like. The team aimed for a design that would appeal to fashion-conscious consumers.\n"
