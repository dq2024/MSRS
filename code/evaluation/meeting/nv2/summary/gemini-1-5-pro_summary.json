    "The group discussed several potential changes to data collection procedures.  They decided to try using CrossPads during meetings, take digital pictures of seating arrangements and whiteboards, ask participants at the end of meetings to mention something interesting they learned, and record oral summaries from those willing to stay after the meeting.  They also discussed collecting video data, but expressed concerns about participant reluctance and the infrastructure required for anonymization.  There was extensive discussion about how to generate queries for the collected data, with some suggesting using summaries or minutes to identify important topics.  However, concerns were raised about potential bias introduced by focusing on information deemed important at the time of the meeting, as opposed to what might become relevant later.\n\nThe professor emphasized the need for a system, even a rudimentary one, that would allow meeting participants to revisit recordings and formulate their own queries, believing this would provide valuable insights into user needs. He also suggested using summaries as a starting point for generating queries and highlighted the importance of understanding the types of questions users might ask, whether requiring simple answers or reflecting broader themes.  He acknowledged the limitations of relying solely on current perceptions of importance and stressed the value of capturing information that might not seem immediately relevant but could become so in the future.\n",
    "The group discussed two remote control models. The first model was a basic remote shaped like a surfboard, priced at 8 Euros.  Its simple design lacked innovative features, scoring low in innovation but high in ease of use. The second model, priced at 16 Euros, included an LCD screen, a cover, six multi-functional buttons, an integrated microphone for voice recognition, and a battery indicator LED. This model scored higher on innovation and look and feel but lower on ease of use due to its more complex functionality.\n\nThe team's budget was 12.50 Euros per unit.  The second model\u2019s cost, initially estimated at 16 Euros, could be reduced by removing the LCD screen, bringing the cost down to approximately 10 Euros.  Removing the speech recognition feature could lower the cost further. The team debated the importance of the LCD screen, ultimately voting to remove it due to cost constraints.  They also discussed the target demographic of 20 to 40-year-olds. While the first model appealed to an older demographic, the second model, with its interactive features, was deemed more suitable for the target market.  The team also explored the idea of customizable covers, aligning with the company\u2019s focus on fashion and electronics.\n",
    "Discussions regarding the Canadian economy's uncertainty and government actions during the COVID-19 pandemic were prevalent throughout the provided meeting transcripts.  Several members raised concerns about the economic impact of the pandemic and the government's response, particularly regarding the efficacy and accessibility of financial aid programs.  Points of contention included the rigidity of eligibility criteria for programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), potentially leaving many small businesses and individuals without support.  Concerns were also raised about the potential for fraud within the CERB program and the government's handling of these cases.  The significant increase in national debt and the long-term economic implications were also discussed, with calls for greater transparency and a clear economic recovery plan from the government.\n\nCathy McLeod raised concerns about the government's handling of personal protective equipment (PPE), questioning the decision to donate PPE to China early in the pandemic while Canadian hospitals and care homes faced shortages. She also questioned the Prime Minister's approval of the sale of seniors' homes to the Chinese government, citing concerns about the quality of care and oversight.\n\nMona Fortier responded to questions regarding the government's economic recovery plan, emphasizing the importance of a green shift and the government's commitment to building a stronger and more resilient economy. She also addressed concerns about Gerald Butts's involvement in the recovery plan, stating that the government's priority is supporting Canadians' health and safety.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the government's decision to seek private sector input for its economic recovery plan, arguing that public servants and opposition parties could provide valuable insights. He also pressed for greater transparency from the government, requesting an economic update and a clear timeline for the recovery plan.  He expressed concern that waiting until the situation stabilizes would be too late for effective action.\n",
    "The industrial designer considered the tiger's hunting strategy, which involves careful planning and seeking secure hiding spots, as worthy of study for product design.  This suggests an interest in incorporating elements of strategic thinking and security into the design process.  Additionally, the designer mentioned the importance of the product's material being lightweight, much like a tiger's agile physique.\n",
    "Team members expressed satisfaction with the Transcriber tool's interface, praising its ease of use for segmenting, labeling speakers, and linking audio.  They found the ability to click on utterances and jump to the corresponding audio helpful. The team discussed potential improvements, including adding more sophisticated search capabilities like those available in THISL, incorporating speaker identification, and integrating a more intuitive interface for controlling playback speed, such as a joystick or foot pedal.  While the current version of Transcriber only displayed two simultaneous speakers, the team had developed workarounds for multiple speakers using scripting and modified conventions.  They also considered merging Transcriber with THISL's information retrieval capabilities.  Overall, despite some limitations, the team viewed Transcriber as a valuable tool and preferred it to commercial transcription services or using speech recognition software due to the expected high error rates in a meeting setting. They also discussed alternative tools like CrossPads and PDAs with wireless cards for note-taking and time-marking during meetings, but found the infrastructure and synchronization to be cumbersome.\n",
    "The design team presented various aspects of the remote control project.  Market research indicated a consumer preference for modern, sleek designs and a willingness to pay more for advanced features like speech recognition, especially among younger demographics.  However, concerns arose about the practicality and cost of implementing reliable speech recognition.  The user interface team emphasized simplicity and user-friendliness, advocating for a minimal number of strategically placed buttons.  They presented different remote control concepts, including child-friendly designs and jumbo remotes.  The industrial design team discussed technical components, proposing options like a rechargeable battery, a robust casing, and various materials.  They also explored the possibility of a scroll wheel and alternative energy sources like solar power.  The project manager facilitated the discussion and assigned individual action items, such as exploring the feasibility of speech recognition, developing a user interface design, and creating a prototype.  The team agreed to revisit the selection of features and finalize the remote control's concept in subsequent meetings.\n",
    "The Welsh Government sought feedback from a variety of stakeholders, including teachers, administrators, students, and members of the business community regarding the new curriculum for Wales. In-person events, focus groups, and online questionnaires were utilized.  The feedback has been largely positive and supportive of the proposed changes, particularly the purpose-led curriculum and the autonomy afforded to teachers.  However, some respondents suggested simplifying and clarifying the language used in the curriculum documents. There were also requests for both simplification and increased detail in various areas.  The government intends to refine the curriculum based on the feedback received, but no significant changes to the overall concept are anticipated.  This refinement process will involve quality improvement practitioners and curriculum assessment groups.\n\nOne key area of discussion revolves around the \u201cwhat matters\u201d statements, which articulate the big ideas within each area of learning and experience.  Initially, these were not intended to be included in primary legislation, but due to feedback emphasizing the need for consistency and a national approach, the government now plans to legislate for the delivery of these statements.  The specific wording of the \u201cwhat matters\u201d statements will be in secondary legislation to allow for future adjustments without requiring amendments to primary legislation.  This approach aims to balance individual school autonomy with national expectations.  For example, mental health and well-being, a key concern for many respondents, is addressed within the \u201cwhat matters\u201d statements under the area of learning and experience for well-being.\n\nAnother significant discussion point concerns the role of pioneer schools and their evolution into innovation schools. Pioneer schools focused on specific aspects of the curriculum, while the smaller group of innovation schools will focus on the practical implementation of the entire curriculum within their respective school settings.  The innovation schools will work with clusters of other schools to share best practices and provide support, an approach informed by lessons learned from Scotland's curriculum reform, where a lack of middle-tier support structures presented challenges.  Each innovation school will receive \u00a330,000 in funding.  The regional consortia will also play a vital role in supporting schools throughout the implementation process.\n",
    "The Project Manager prioritized staying within the \u20ac12.50 budget, viewing the \u20ac25 selling price as fixed.  They championed maximizing value for the customer within that price constraint, suggesting improvements to the \u20ac8 basic model were preferable to high profit margins. They expressed concerns about the speech recognition component's cost and efficacy, questioning its value. The Project Manager found the higher-priced model with the LCD screen more appealing, particularly for the target demographic, but acknowledged cost constraints might make it unfeasible. They favored a conventional button layout and questioned whether a cover would obscure the LCD screen, a key selling point.  The Project Manager also suggested exploring removable covers with varying colors and textures, aligning with the company's fashion-forward approach, but ultimately prioritized practicality and cost-effectiveness. They were less focused on specific button designs, leaving those decisions to the design team, but advocated for simplicity and sizable information display.  They also favored kinetic power supply for its ease of use and cost savings on battery replacements.  Ultimately, the Project Manager sought a balance between innovation, aesthetics, and affordability, pushing for features like the scroll wheel while acknowledging budget limitations.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed incorporating digital recordings of notes alongside audio recordings of meetings.  Initially, they experimented with CrossPads, digital notepads allowing for handwritten notes with timestamps.  However, due to poor handwriting recognition, cumbersome infrastructure requirements, and a general lack of note-taking during meetings, CrossPads were deemed impractical.  The team decided to return one of the two CrossPads they had borrowed.  They briefly considered having a dedicated scribe take notes during the meetings or summarize them afterward, but this wasn't viewed as a long-term solution.  The idea of using PDAs with wireless cards for note-taking and time-stamping was proposed as a more user-friendly alternative.\n\nRegarding video recordings, the team acknowledged the value of visual information for capturing the meeting context, speaker positions, and whiteboard content.  They proposed taking digital photos of the meeting room setup and whiteboards.  However, continuous video recording was considered problematic due to privacy concerns, increased infrastructure requirements, and lack of immediate application within the project's scope.  They ultimately decided against routine video recording, preferring to prioritize audio data collection and transcription.  The team acknowledged that other institutions, like NIST and LDC, might undertake larger-scale data collection efforts incorporating video, and they wanted to avoid duplicating efforts.\n",
    "Project financing and the \u201cdrawing board,\u201d presumed to be a digital whiteboard/SMARTboard, were discussed in two separate portions of the meetings.  First, the project manager brought up financing after the initial design presentations. He indicated that the financial details would be discussed later but reassured the team that they would go over the notes.  However, this did not happen until much later in the meetings, after the design evaluation. The project manager then presented a spreadsheet detailing the company's cost analysis for various design aspects. He highlighted decisions made due to budget constraints, such as using a standard chip instead of a more advanced one. The team discussed the trade-offs between cost and innovation, emphasizing the product's unique fashion-forward concept and interchangeable covers as justification for exceeding the initial budget.  They ultimately agreed that the product's innovative design and market potential offset the slightly higher cost.\n\nThe second discussion revolved around the digital whiteboard and digital pen. The project manager asked the team for feedback on these tools. Reactions were mixed. Some team members found the whiteboard cumbersome, preferring traditional methods of sketching and note-taking. The digital pen was criticized for its impracticality and the difficulty of sharing or integrating handwritten notes into digital documents. One member suggested that the board\u2019s poor performance might be due to malfunction. The team ultimately agreed to test a new board to determine if it would be a valuable tool in future projects.  It was generally felt that the cost of the board and special paper was too high given its current functionality.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer focused on the remote's physical attributes, emphasizing the squishy, interchangeable fruit and vegetable-shaped bases, the button layout, and the materials used.  They expressed concerns about cost constraints related to rubberized materials and multiple button colors.  They also advocated for the LCD panel and advanced chip, highlighting the user's ability to monitor actions on the TV screen.  Later, the Industrial Designer championed the use of Play-Doh during the design process, emphasizing its tactile benefits for creative exploration.\n\nThe Project Manager facilitated discussions, focusing on meeting project goals, budget constraints, and finalizing design specifications. They questioned design choices regarding the remote's shape, size, button functionality, and slogan placement, demonstrating a concern for user experience and practicality. They also sought clarification on technical aspects, like the type of chip and the meaning of \"single\" and \"double curve\" casing. The Project Manager ultimately guided the team to compromise on certain features, like the solar cells, due to budget limitations.\n\nAfter team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the final product, while not incorporating all initial ideas, was satisfactory, trendy, and within budget.  They expressed some disappointment about not using both plastic and rubber materials.  The Project Manager also noted the team's effective collaboration and problem-solving despite project constraints.\n",
    "The team's decision-making process involved brainstorming various features, evaluating their feasibility based on cost and technical limitations, and considering market trends.  Initially, they explored advanced features like touchscreens and scroll wheels, but these were dismissed due to cost and concerns about bulkiness.  They opted for a simpler design with standard push buttons and a basic circuit board to keep costs down.  Kinetic power was favored over batteries for its novelty and eco-friendliness, with a small backup battery as a fallback.  Voice recognition was initially considered but tabled due to cost and existing market saturation.  Later, it was reintroduced as a key selling point, leveraging in-house technology and market research indicating consumer interest.\n\nThe team aimed for a \"sleek and sexy\" aesthetic, contrasting with existing remotes they deemed unfashionable. They discussed incorporating current fashion trends, such as spongy textures and fruit/vegetable themes, but ultimately decided against these due to concerns about fleeting trends and usability.  A rubberized casing and buttons were chosen for their tactile appeal and durability.  Curved designs were explored, with a single curve ultimately chosen as a compromise between aesthetics and practicality.  Changeable casings were discussed as a way to incorporate fashion elements and offer customization options, but the logo requirement posed a challenge.\n\nExisting remotes were criticized for being bulky, complex, and unattractive.  Universal remotes were deemed too complex and costly to compete with.  The team sought to differentiate their product by focusing on a user-centered design with fewer buttons, ease of use, and a unique, modern appearance. They also discussed incorporating features like a tracking device to address the common problem of lost remotes.  Ultimately, they aimed to create a non-remote-looking remote, focusing on a simple, stylish design with voice recognition as a differentiating feature.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of the remote control design.  They considered environmental-friendly materials, settling on a combination of plastic and rubber due to cost and availability.  Current trends, such as soft, spongy, and ergonomic designs, influenced their preference for a rubberized feel.  Potential materials included titanium, but it was deemed too expensive and impractical.  The team debated the inclusion of an LCD screen, ultimately rejecting it due to cost and a lack of clear functionality.  They explored vibrant, natural colors, especially yellow to align with corporate branding, and considered a transparent or translucent case to create a glowing effect. A snowman-like shape with a potential folding feature emerged as a design concept.  The material and function were intertwined in discussions about the jog dial, which was favored for controlling volume and channels.  A questionnaire wasn't explicitly mentioned, but market research indicating consumer preferences for aesthetics over functionality played a significant role in the design direction.  The team also briefly discussed incorporating the company slogan, potentially through audio feedback upon activation or deactivation.\n",
    "The project manager introduced the new product as a television remote control to be sold internationally with a target production cost of under \u20ac12.50. The team used an interactive whiteboard to brainstorm.  The industrial designer raised initial technical considerations, including interoperability with other devices and moving beyond infrared technology. The user interface designer emphasized the importance of intuitive button design and visibility in the dark.  \n\nThe group discussed multi-functional versus single-functional remotes, leaning towards a universal remote compatible with various devices. Lower grades in the technological aspect stemmed from cost concerns, as advanced features like touchscreens or extensive displays would increase the price.  The locator function wasn't explicitly mentioned in this portion of the meeting transcripts. However, the discussion about the range of infrared and Bluetooth could be indirectly related to a locator function, as it addresses the remote's ability to communicate with the television from different distances and locations.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C did not directly discuss the variance.  PhD C proposed using equalized speech to make spectral distortion clearer than in PDA recordings. He planned to hand-mark overlapping zones and classify frames as \"overlapping,\" \"speech,\" or \"silence\" to study parameters for classifying speech and overlapping speech. PhD C suggested using a clustering algorithm or neural network for this classification. Professor D recommended visualizing features in two dimensions before using complex classifiers and incorporating temporal properties into the model. PhD C mentioned using a modified pitch tracker and planned to test different parameters for classification. He also expressed interest in studying the binaural problem using information from PDA recordings.  Jose's difficulties stemmed from the presence of overlapping speech, which is pervasive in the meeting recordings.  The overlaps created challenges for automatic segmentation, requiring hand-marking of overlapping zones. The discussion primarily revolved around how to improve overlap detection using various acoustic features and classification methods.\n",
    "The initial system had a total latency of 330ms.  Several components contributed to this latency: a low-frequency band filter (64ms), a high-frequency band filter (11ms), downsampling, online normalization (85ms), the neural network/PCA (80ms), and other miscellaneous processes.  Through various improvements, including the design of new IIR filters, the low-frequency band filter delay was reduced to 60ms. This, along with other adjustments, brought the total latency down to approximately 240ms, just barely meeting the 250ms requirement (although there was discussion of potentially stricter limits of 130ms or even 40-50ms being imposed).\n\nThe professor expressed concern over several aspects of the latency. Firstly, the initial latency was too high. Secondly, insufficient communication between the team and Sunil (who designed some of the components) contributed to the latency issues. Thirdly, the professor was worried about future restrictions on latency, which could necessitate significant system changes.  He questioned the amount of effort being invested in reducing latency, especially for the neural network component, suggesting that performance should be the primary focus. The professor also pointed out that in previous applications, latencies of 250ms were perceived as instantaneous by users, implying that the current latency might be acceptable in practice.\n",
    "User Interface introduced a prototype remote control with several key features.  The remote includes a joystick-like button enabling 360-degree directional movement, simulating mouse functionality (click, double-click, swing). It also features a microphone for speech recognition, an on/off switch for this feature, and a modular design allowing customization.  Users can add or remove components like an LCD screen, parental control modules, and modules for seniors with large buttons.  The modularity allows users to pay only for desired features, potentially lowering the cost.  The remote uses AA rechargeable batteries and has a charging cradle. Software innovations include a misplaced remote reminder and programmable channel/vocabulary options.  The team highlighted the remote's simplicity, offering powerful functionalities with few buttons, and its robust titanium casing. The prototype cost $15, but simpler versions could be produced for less.\n",
    "The prototype presentation showcased two versions: a rounded, blob-like design and a banana-shaped one. Both featured a simplified button layout, a central directional control mimicking a scroll wheel (though using push-button technology), and an on/off switch. The blob prototype was envisioned in hard plastic, while the banana-shaped one could be either hard plastic or have a spongy rubber casing. The team favored bright yellow with black buttons to align with company colors.  The directional control's unique design, resembling a logo and reminiscent of mobile phone navigation, was highlighted.  The team emphasized the simple, child-friendly aesthetic, aiming for a minimalist and elegant design rather than a technologically complex one.\n\nDiscussion during the evaluation centered on the prototypes' appearance, functionality, and marketability.  The team debated the ideal shape, settling on a design somewhere between the blob and the banana. Concerns arose regarding the banana shape's robustness if made with a spongy material. The team generally agreed on the prototype's ease of use, minimalist design, and potential cost-effectiveness, while acknowledging its lack of technological innovation. The \"fancy\" aspect was deemed more of an aesthetic or stylish quality.  The innovative menu-driven system, replacing excessive buttons, was highlighted.  The kinetic energy aspect remained underdeveloped, and the team recognized the need for programming expertise for menu functionality.  Cost was a significant factor, with an estimated nine pounds twenty, well within the twelve-fifty budget.\n\nThe conclusion was positive, with an average evaluation score of 1.88, indicating strong adherence to market ideals. The team considered the project a success, praising the design, teamwork, and efficient use of resources. The simple technology was a deliberate choice to maintain robustness and cost-effectiveness, and the team expressed confidence in the product's marketability.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the various features of the new remote control, including the touch screen, flip screen, battery issues, and flip-top design, all while considering budget constraints and desired functionalities.  Initially, a touch screen and LCD screen were considered for the interface, particularly for the flip-top's interior. However, due to budget limitations, these were ultimately rejected in favor of a simpler and more cost-effective rubberized button interface.  The team also explored different battery options. Rechargeable batteries, dynamo charging, and solar charging were all discussed.  Concerns arose regarding the practicality and cost-effectiveness of these options, especially considering the remote's usage patterns. Ultimately, kinetic charging, similar to that used in wristwatches, combined with a small watch battery, was chosen as the most viable solution.  The flip-top design was a consistent element throughout the discussions.  The team agreed on a plastic shell with a rubberized cover to provide a spongy feel and allow for interchangeable covers in various colors, inspired by fruits and vegetables. The idea of incorporating a small mirror into the flip-top was briefly considered but dismissed as impractical.  While voice recognition and a location-finding feature were desirable innovations, cost concerns led to their potential exclusion, pending further investigation into pricing and feasibility.  Ultimately, the final design prioritized cost-effectiveness and ease of use while still aiming for a unique look and feel.\n",
    "Schools Challenge Cymru was a three-year program focused on improving a select group of secondary schools.  The program had mixed results, showing improvement in some schools more than others, with leadership and staff changes being contributing factors in the variability.  While the program officially ended, its influence continues through the regional consortia, which absorbed many of the successful Schools Challenge Cymru advisors. The regional consortia now have a broader reach, supporting all schools, including primary schools that were previously excluded from the program. The Welsh Government views the program as a success in building regional school improvement capacity, despite some criticism about its limited three-year timeframe and concerns about a perceived \"fading out\" in the final year.  The government maintains that a transition phase was necessary to integrate the program's successes into the consortia's work, ensuring a wider application of best practices. While the program\u2019s dedicated funding returned to reserves, the Welsh Government continues to discuss and allocate resources for school improvement through the regional consortia, emphasizing a whole-system approach.  Lessons learned, such as the importance of strong leadership, comprehensive tracking systems, teacher quality, and collaborative activities, are being integrated into the national mission for educational improvement. The consortia are tasked with challenging schools on their use of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) and demonstrating impact.  Although Estyn noted some concerns about the consortia's ability to maintain the same level of intensive support, the government expressed confidence in the consortia's capacity to drive continued progress, citing examples of sustained improvement in schools like Tredegar and Eastern High.\n",
    "Dr. Blaney believes Brexit has created significant uncertainty for Welsh higher education, particularly concerning EU student recruitment and research collaboration. While HEFCW remains apolitical, he acknowledges that Brexit's impact will be judged differently depending on political viewpoints.  He notes an 8% decrease in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 2% rise in England.  He attributes this to two main factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students (though he notes Wales' deal is no worse than England's, and the fees are slightly lower) and the comparative lack of investment in Welsh university facilities compared to England. He suggests the better-resourced English institutions are perceived as offering a better student experience.  Dr. Blaney suggests prospective students should choose Wales because it offers a UK-quality degree within a safer, more supportive environment, particularly due to the smaller size of Welsh cities. He highlights the \"Study in Wales\" program, a collective effort to promote Wales as a desirable study destination emphasizing its distinct advantages.\n",
    "The mental spaces framework, as discussed in the transcripts, incorporates domains relevant to the ongoing project.  These include the tourist domain, child language learning, and general linguistic phenomena.  The \"middle layer\" being discussed appears to be the level of \"construal,\" which acts as a bridge between abstract, general constructions (such as Source-Path-Goal) and the specific meanings derived from utterances in context.\n\nThe middle layer functions by employing mechanisms like metonymy and metaphor, allowing base-level constructions to be applied to more nuanced situations. For instance, the word \u201cin\u201d can refer to physical containment (\"in the bus\") or a more abstract state (\"in trouble\").  Similarly, the question \"Where is the castle?\" can be construed as a request for location or for the castle's entrance fee. This construal process also accounts for how language users interpret metaphorical expressions, like \"I'm in a hurry,\" where the state of hurry is treated as a container.\n\nThe system aims to achieve orthogonality between base constructions and construal mechanisms. This means a new base construction should seamlessly interact with existing metaphors and metonymies and vice versa.  This approach offers scalability and avoids the need for an unwieldy number of specific rules within the grammar.  The system uses a probabilistic relational model, drawing on ontology, situation, user, and discourse models to infer the intended construal of an utterance.  The discussion suggests ongoing refinement of this model, particularly in representing the relationships between intentions, actions, and the schemas that underlie them.\n",
    "The professor discussed several aspects of the back-end and data storage.  He emphasized the need to minimize change requests to the EML team responsible for the XML structure and suggested an iterative process within the research group to refine their requests.  He also discussed the importance of a well-defined ontology for the database, noting that the current version was in German and required translation.  The professor highlighted the challenge of reference problems, even with a structured database, citing examples like \"How do I get to the Powder Tower?\" and the ambiguity of referring expressions. He also mentioned the use of hash tables or tags in the ontology to store information like the likelihood of people interacting with different object types (e.g., entering, viewing, approaching).  He questioned whether JavaBayes supported the necessary combining functions for probabilistic evidence combination and suggested exploring alternative packages if needed.  Finally, he discussed data storage, suggesting the use of non-backed-up disks with a one-time backup to tape as a solution to the increasing nightly backup times.\n",
    "Discussions surrounding the seniors care crisis highlighted the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care facilities.  Horrific conditions, including neglect, abuse, and inadequate infection control measures, were revealed by Canadian Armed Forces reports, prompting calls for national standards similar to the Canada Health Act and the removal of profit from long-term care.  While the government acknowledged the urgent need for action, they emphasized the provinces' jurisdiction over long-term care, committing to collaboration but stopping short of federal mandates.  The relationship between racism and long-term care was not explicitly discussed, although systemic racism within institutions like the RCMP was raised.  Amendments to policies protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were also discussed, with concerns raised about the government's failure to deliver on promised changes to bankruptcy insolvency laws and calls for stronger protections for workers' pensions and benefits.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay affirmed the importance of public debate on policies and programs affecting veterans and their families, emphasizing the government's commitment to providing appropriate compensation and openness to input.  However, concerns were raised about red-flagging of veterans' files and the impact of recent firearm legislation on disabled veterans.  The Minister of Seniors' statement on pandemic assistance was not included in these transcripts.  However, the government discussed various pandemic assistance programs, including the CERB, wage subsidy, and business loans, acknowledging the need for flexibility and ongoing adjustments to address gaps and ensure support reaches those most in need.  Debate arose regarding the Liberal Party's use of the wage subsidy program, with opposition parties questioning its ethical implications given the party's financial resources.\n",
    "The disagreements stemmed from differing priorities and interpretations of user needs. The Industrial Designer prioritized cost-effectiveness and proposed infrared technology, simpler components, and a wired connection, while Marketing emphasized user experience, advocating for wireless functionality and a \"fancy\" aesthetic.  The Project Manager mediated, highlighting user research indicating a preference for fewer buttons and intuitive design.  Conflicting ideas about the remote's shape, color options, and inclusion of parental controls further fueled disagreements. The Industrial Designer suggested multiple color options and animal shapes to appeal to children, but the Project Manager raised concerns about increased production costs.  Differing approaches to parental controls\u2014integrating them into the remote versus a separate device\u2014also caused friction.  Essentially, the tension arose from balancing functionality, aesthetics, and cost, as each team member prioritized different aspects of the product's design.\n",
    "Marketing devised a 7-point scale evaluation system (1 being high and 7 being low) based on criteria gleaned from earlier meetings and market research. The criteria were as follows: Is it aesthetically pleasing? Is it easy to use? Is it fashionable? Does it feel good? Is it technologically innovative? Is it trendy?  The team rated each criterion individually and then averaged the scores.  Additionally, Marketing brought forward the idea of theming the product with a line of colors, such as a \"harvest line,\" to enhance its fashionable appeal. They also suggested exploring more three-dimensional shapes beyond the initially flat design.\n",
    "Transcription is nearly finished, with only about 30 minutes left to transcribe.  A process has been established for checking and standardizing the transcripts, including spell-checking, standardizing spoken forms like \"cuz\", and marking non-speech sounds and comments. Transcribers will also extract and record digit strings.  The recordings are available and segmented by speaker turns, with plans to downsample and compress them for ASR.  Eighteen gigabytes of storage are available, and additional space can be acquired if necessary.\n\nRegarding intermediate categories and the SPG schema, the team has developed an XML schema for representing actions and their related schemas, like Source-Path-Goal.  The schema includes categories like Enter, View, and Approach, each with its own roles and potentially multiple associated schemas.  The team debated the best way to represent the relationships between actions and schemas in the XML, considering issues of redundancy, hierarchy, and ease of use for different modules.  They plan to refine the schema based on further discussion and testing, and XML examples will be provided for review next week.  The team also discussed the need for bindings between intention-specific and action-specific roles, and how to represent these in the XML.  Finally, they discussed the possibility of using multiple schemas in parallel to capture the full meaning of an utterance.\n",
    "In addressing the proposed amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, the Deputy Minister, Julie Morgan, responded to concerns across various groups.  Regarding the *duty to promote public awareness* (Group 1), she accepted the committee's recommendation to include this duty on the face of the Bill, committing to a six-year, high-intensity campaign.  However, she rejected amendments specifying target groups (e.g., visitors) or topics (e.g., parenting support), arguing these were too prescriptive and could be addressed effectively through existing channels like the parenting expert group.  She also dismissed the need for guidance on reporting concerns, stating safeguarding is a universal responsibility.\n\nOn the *duty to report on the effect of the legislation* (Group 2), Morgan agreed to a post-implementation review, outlining a multi-faceted approach including attitudinal surveys and a dedicated task and finish group.  She rejected amendments requiring a pre-commencement report on public awareness and specific report content, deeming them unnecessary given existing plans for evaluation and data collection.  However, she showed openness to discussing the content of interim reports with the committee.\n\nFinally, regarding *regulation-making powers* (Group 3), Morgan's amendment aimed to reinstate the power to make transitional provisions, a power inadvertently removed by other amendments.  She argued against broader regulation-making powers, believing them unnecessary, but agreed to further discussion with the committee before Stage 3.  Throughout her responses, the Deputy Minister emphasized ongoing stakeholder engagement, existing frameworks for addressing concerns, and the need for flexibility in implementation.\n",
    "Discussions on raising standards and improving educational attainment emphasized long-term strategies like curriculum reform and increased teacher support.  These strategies aimed to improve teaching quality, which was identified as a major factor influencing student outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged students. While standardized test scores like PISA were used as one benchmark, there was a shift away from relying solely on data-driven performance measures.  Instead, the focus broadened to include a more holistic evaluation of school performance, encompassing factors like student well-being, teacher development, and community engagement.\n\nPhilip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, highlighted his organization's role as a regulator, ensuring qualifications are designed and assessed fairly.  This included approving specifications, monitoring awarding processes, and maintaining standards across cohorts. Blaker emphasized the importance of comparable outcomes to ensure fairness during periods of curriculum change and stressed the need for appropriate timelines for reforms to avoid systemic pressures. He also raised concerns about the current textbook model, suggesting a shift towards curriculum-focused resources rather than qualification-specific ones.  Blaker advocated for a review of the current system's reliance on commercial publishers and suggested exploring alternative models, including potential Welsh Government involvement in resource development.\n\nThe lack of timely textbooks, particularly in Welsh, was a recurring concern.  While digital resources were available, their accessibility and suitability were questioned.  The WJEC acknowledged the challenges posed by multiple, simultaneous qualification reforms and short timelines for resource development.  A pilot program was mentioned where English textbooks would be held back to be released concurrently with their Welsh translations, though this approach sparked debate about potential disadvantages for English-medium learners.  Ultimately, all parties agreed on the need for timely, accessible resources, regardless of language, to support learners with diverse learning styles.  The optimal model for resource development and distribution, however, remained a point of ongoing discussion.\n",
    "Implementing consistent early childhood education and care (ECEC) provision across Wales faces several challenges.  The current ECEC system is complex, having evolved from various programs with differing objectives, including child development and parental employment support.  This complexity creates administrative burdens for local authorities, requiring extensive documentation from parents to prove eligibility for programs like the childcare offer.  Additionally, demand for ECEC services varies across Wales due to cultural factors, such as reliance on informal family care in some areas, and economic factors, with higher costs in urban centers like Cardiff potentially impacting the affordability and feasibility of a universal \u00a34.50 hourly rate for childcare.  Geographic targeting of programs like Flying Start, while aiming to reach disadvantaged children, also creates disparities in access to services.  Finally, ensuring sufficient capacity, both in terms of qualified workforce and physical facilities, is crucial for successful implementation across Wales, especially considering regional variations in the existing childcare sector. The implications for childcare services include the need for increased investment in preventative services, support for parents, and workforce development to ensure high-quality provision.  Standardizing funding rates and simplifying application processes are also key considerations for a more equitable and efficient system.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote\u2019s components.  For the case material, initial options included plastic, wood, latex, titanium, and rubber.  Titanium was deemed unsuitable for curved designs, and concerns arose regarding rubber's heat sensitivity and plastic's brittleness.  Wood emerged as the favored material, with an emphasis on exotic varieties and the possibility of customized, user-designed cases.  The team acknowledged potential drawbacks of wood, such as splintering and durability, especially for children.\n\nInterface options included push buttons, a scroll wheel (similar to an iPod), and an LCD screen.  A simple chip would suffice for push buttons, while a scroll wheel required a regular chip, and an LCD screen necessitated an advanced and more expensive chip.  The team debated the scroll wheel\u2019s practicality, especially for channel surfing.  While some saw its potential for navigating on-screen menus and adjusting volume, others favored push buttons for cost-effectiveness and ease of use.  The team ultimately leaned towards push buttons, with the possibility of revisiting the scroll wheel decision later.  An LCD screen\u2019s usefulness was questioned, given the presence of a television screen.  Its inclusion depended on cost and functionality, particularly for speech recognition training.  The team also discussed a flip screen to protect buttons and a battery life indicator light.  The final decision on components and interface design was postponed pending prototype development and further cost analysis, especially for the LCD screen.\n",
    "The professor expresses concern over the relatively high error rate (3.4%) of the current digit recognition system compared to the TI-digits database's 0.8% rate. He attributes this difference to the cleaner, less realistic nature of the TI-digits recordings and the larger amount of training data used in commercial systems. He suggests exploring how much improvement could be achieved by inputting tandem features into the SRI system or increasing the amount of training data for the HMMs. He believes that accurately identifying the factors contributing to the higher error rate (beyond noise and channel issues) is crucial, especially given that the current system incorporates adaptation, a modern advantage.  He emphasizes the need for publishable results, suggesting that focusing on the Meeting Recorder digits, which are closer to real-world scenarios, could yield more impactful findings.  He questions why the error rate is higher in this more realistic environment and suggests the team consider the amount of training data as a primary factor. He also shows interest in the discussion around zero pronunciation, confirming that both \"zero\" and \"O\" are acceptable and common pronunciations for the digit.\n",
    "The team discussed the new remote control project, focusing on design and functionality.  A key decision was to abandon plans for a touchscreen due to cost, estimated at \u20ac17.50 per unit, exceeding the target retail price of \u20ac25.  Instead, they opted to include voice recognition, leveraging existing in-house technology.  This feature, deemed more marketable and cost-effective, especially for the target demographic of 15-35 year olds, aligned with the company's focus on innovation.  The team also explored the possibility of internet connectivity for program-driven interface, using the TV screen for feedback. However, the remote's functionality would be restricted to TV controls only, excluding DVD players or VCRs, due to time constraints.  Universal compatibility was also a concern.  The team favored a smaller, easy-to-use design, prioritizing essential buttons like power, channel, and volume, with additional functions accessible through a menu button or voice commands.  Aesthetics were emphasized, aiming for a sleek, stylish design with multiple color options and a potential \"locator\" function.  The team briefly discussed alternative input methods like a scroll wheel but ultimately favored traditional buttons alongside voice control.  The project name \"Mando\" was chosen. The next steps included developing prototypes and further refining the user interface and component design.\n",
    "Vaughan Gething expressed concern over the mental health and well-being of children and young people during the COVID-19 pandemic and acknowledged the likelihood of a pandemic-related spike in suicides.  He stated that the Welsh Government had commissioned a review, conducted by the delivery unit in conjunction with a national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths occurring since the start of the pandemic. This review aims to determine the pandemic's effects on mental health and well-being, particularly its link to any increase in suicides among children and young people. Gething anticipated the review's report to be available by the end of the month.  Regarding perinatal mental health, he mentioned a round-table discussion with the NSPCC showcasing good practices in supporting new mothers and families. He highlighted efforts to ensure consistent perinatal support across Wales through phone and online services due to concerns about physical contact.  Gething acknowledged a decrease in women accessing mother and baby unit provisions, attributing it to fear and lockdown restrictions rather than a lack of need. He committed to considering this factor in future planning.  He also confirmed the government's commitment to establishing in-patient perinatal mental health provisions, though the timeline remained uncertain due to pandemic-related disruptions. He commended the staff's dedication to providing these services during uncertain times, recognizing the increased challenges in perinatal mental health care during the pandemic.\n",
    "Implementation of the new curriculum will begin in 2022.  There was concern that focusing too heavily on accountability frameworks could detract from the aims of the new curriculum.  There was additional concern over a lack of consistency across schools in delivering the curriculum and how that might affect student outcomes. To address this, the \u201cwhat matters\u201d statements, which outline broad concepts for each area of learning and experience, will be given legal status to ensure consistent implementation across Wales.  These statements will be included in secondary legislation, allowing for future adjustments without requiring complete legislative overhaul. The legal mandate to deliver these statements, however, will be enshrined in primary legislation.  There were no discussions regarding making improvements that present more of a challenge.\n\nIn the meeting, the transition to post-16 education was discussed, with an emphasis on ensuring alignment between pre-16 and post-16 systems.  Further Education institutions have been involved in the curriculum's development to ensure a smooth transition.  Regarding Pupil Referral Units (PRUs), the new curriculum will establish a minimum set of expectations, including the four purposes of the curriculum, cross-cutting themes (literacy, numeracy, digital competency), and health and well-being.  Beyond this minimum, individual pupil needs will be assessed in conjunction with the child and their family to determine the most appropriate additional learning.  There was discussion on networking within the regional consortia to provide support to schools. No specific networking within PRUs was discussed beyond ensuring that they benefit from the new curriculum and integrating their approach with the broader educational landscape.  The transition arrangements will include an evaluation of existing guidance, with a focus on ensuring consistent implementation and addressing any gaps.  Additionally, the concept of a 0-25 service model was discussed as a way to reduce the number of transitions and improve overall care.\n",
    "The group discussed disposable income in the context of the target demographic. They noted that younger people (15-25) had more disposable income because they typically did not have large expenses like mortgages or car payments. This made them more willing to spend money on non-essential items like a new remote control, even one that cost more due to features like voice recognition.  The infra-red functionality was seen as a standard and cost-effective transmission method for the remote.  There was discussion of other options, but infra-red was the existing standard for televisions, which made it the easiest and cheapest to implement.  There were concerns about line-of-sight issues with infra-red if voice recognition was implemented, as the user might be holding the remote in a way that would block the signal.\n",
    "The group expresses significant concern about the effectiveness of using free school meal (FSM) eligibility as a measure of disadvantage. While acknowledging it as the \"best available proxy\" in the absence of a more precise alternative, Kirsty Williams recognizes its limitations in accurately targeting pupils in need. The group discusses potential future replacements, including those based on universal credit, but emphasizes the need for public consultation before any changes are made.  They also discuss the inflexibility of the current annual assessment in January, exploring the possibility of a more responsive, multi-year system to aid schools in long-term planning.\n\nThe impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement for FSM children is viewed as positive but insufficient.  Estyn reports improvements in attendance, but a persistent gap remains between FSM and non-FSM pupils.  Successful interventions highlighted include schools employing teaching assistants to escort children to school and engaging with families to address barriers to attendance.  However, concerns arise regarding the sustainability of such initiatives and their adaptability to older students. While the PDG is being used to fund these interventions, the group acknowledges that a multi-agency approach and broader societal changes are necessary for significant improvements.  They also note a concerning trend of secondary schools focusing PDG resources on Key Stage 4 interventions, rather than earlier, preventative measures.\n",
    "The professor discussed several aspects of speech recognition, referencing prior work and current research.  He mentioned support vector machines in the context of a student project, where they were being explored as a potential alternative to recurrent neural nets for mapping MFCCs to phonological features.  He noted that support vector machines are reputed to be effective with limited training data, offering a more succinct model representation than neural nets or Gaussian mixture models.  While acknowledging prior work using support vector machines for probability estimation in speech recognition, he didn't express a strong opinion on their overall suitability for the task.  The discussion of speech rate algorithms primarily focused on analyzing and mitigating the effects of reverberation and noise in far-field speech recognition.  The professor emphasized the importance of spectral subtraction techniques, various noise estimation methods, and the potential benefits of multi-band processing, referencing algorithms like RASTA and PLP. He did not explicitly connect speech rate algorithms with support vector machines, suggesting these were separate lines of inquiry.\n",
    "The professor believes speech applications like talking to a remote recognizer benefit from latency-reducing strategies like echo cancellation, despite the challenges posed by factors like speaker movement and noise.  He suggests exploring \"block echo cancellation\" as a potentially viable approach, distinct from complete room acoustic inversion.  He emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of echo cancellation, especially in noisy and reverberant environments, highlighting the tendency of inverted room transfer functions to become unstable.  He contrasts this with the alternative \"party line\" approach of using robust features and multi-stream methods that tolerate reverberation without attempting to create a clean signal.  The professor also underscores the need for manual marking of speaker overlaps as ground truth for evaluating automatic overlap detection based on measures like energy increases and LPC residual energy. He acknowledges the time-consuming nature of this process but stresses its importance in guiding the development of effective overlap detectors.\n",
    "The team discussed various user interface options for the new television remote. Initially, they considered advanced features like voice control, LCD touch screens, and multi-device functionality. However, due to budget constraints, time-to-market pressure, and user feedback emphasizing simplicity, they decided against these complex features.  The team opted for a more traditional button-based approach, prioritizing ease of use for their target demographic, which included older users.\n\nThey explored different button layouts, considering dedicated buttons for essential functions like channel switching, volume control, and an on/off button. The inclusion of a \"previous channel\" button was also discussed. To address user frustration with lost remotes, they decided to incorporate a backlighting feature.  A key design challenge was balancing simplicity with functionality.  The team debated between a traditional numerical keypad and a scroll wheel for channel selection, ultimately favoring the scroll wheel.  They also discussed integrating teletext and subtitle functions into a single button.  The final design decision involved a simplified button layout, a scroll wheel, backlighting, and an LCD screen.  The team believed this design would appeal to a broader audience while keeping production costs manageable.\n",
    "The project manager believed the lightweight plastic was not a problem and considered the rubbery changeable cover a key element of the design.  They felt the rubbery material provided a unique \u201cspongy\u201d feel that differentiated the product and increased durability. The manager initially suggested delivering the product in black to cut costs but was open to other colors as long as the product hit the target budget. The shape, initially conceived with a double curve, was simplified to a single curve (\u201cbanana curve\u201d) to reduce manufacturing costs. The project manager prioritized the single curve and rubbery feel, believing these features were essential for market differentiation and aligned with consumer preferences for a unique tactile experience. They viewed these design elements as crucial for making the product stand out in the market.\n",
    "Researchers are using spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering to fix the system.  They are smoothing along time and frequency, applying the procedure on FFT bins with a Wiener filter, and working on mel bands with spectral subtraction.  They are also adding noise after cleaning the mel bins.  Currently, the software is being set up and the default system gives a score of 53.66, which is 1% off the best proposal.  There was no explicit stationary noise handling before.  The neural net may operate on the output of either Wiener filtering or spectral subtraction, or it may operate on the original depending on whether it is server side or terminal side.  The neural net transforms all the features used, creating new FFTs with noise removed.  Transformed and untransformed features are used, and the goal is to have a firm path forward by next week.  The VAD boundaries provided by default are okay but not great.  Dropping beginning and end frames improved the baseline by 14%, while the current VAD improved it by more than 20%.  The VAD adds a latency of 40ms plus ranking, which is another 10ms, so the total delay is now determined by the delay of the VAD.  There didn\u2019t seem to be a penalty for making it causal.  Wiener filter is 40ms delay and LDA is 100ms delay.  One group says total latency is 130ms while another group says 250ms. Latency is a secondary issue to performance.  Frame dropping can be done server side or by sending additional frames before and after on the terminal side.  The current system marks speech/non-speech and drops frames after delta features are computed.  Guenter\u2019s noise estimation got worse when plugged into the system.  There needs to be a compromise between depending on the first 15 frames and depending on a pause.  The channel zero VAD was used for noise estimation and frame dropping, and there is no split on which one helped more.  It is important to have something that works well in general and not rely on the first 15 frames.  Next steps include keeping the same neural network for VAD but training it on more data and adding better features. The final net comes after LDA, and it can be used for final frame dropping but not for noise estimation.  The initial decision for silence/speech happens quickly, and it is used for frame dropping if there is more than 500ms of non-speech.  The same method will be kept, but noise estimation could be improved.  The neural net will be included at the end later in the month.  The plan is to sort out where to go next with the work before Hynek\u2019s next trip.\n",
    "Discussions across the meetings covered a range of legislative, economic, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n\nProposed legislation included Bill C-7, which would remove safeguards around euthanasia, and Bill S-204, criminalizing organ harvesting abroad.  Petitioners voiced concerns about both bills.  Firearms legislation was also debated, with disagreements on the effectiveness of banning \"military-style assault rifles.\" Some argued the ban targets law-abiding citizens while others emphasized public safety, citing support from police organizations.\n\nEconomic discussions focused on government support for various sectors.  Concerns were raised about delays in infrastructure project approvals and the need for aid to municipalities, particularly for transit services.  The tourism and fishing industries, significantly impacted by the pandemic, sought additional support beyond existing programs.  Debate arose regarding aid to the energy sector, with some advocating for a \"green recovery\" and others emphasizing the need for continued support for oil and gas workers.  The agricultural sector also requested increased assistance, particularly potato farmers facing surplus due to restaurant closures. Small businesses struggled to access relief programs, with issues around payroll requirements and landlord participation in rent relief.  There were calls for streamlining these programs and expanding eligibility, including for sole proprietors.  The impact of the pandemic on the airline industry and the issue of ticket refunds were also raised.  Finally, there was a discussion of leveraging the forestry industry for economic recovery and the energy transition.\n\nSocial impacts of the pandemic included trial delays potentially leading to criminals being released, the vulnerability of indigenous communities, and the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on seniors in long-term care homes.  There were calls for increased support for seniors, including through OAS and CPP increases and RRSP withdrawal flexibility.  Mental health support for essential workers, protection of temporary foreign workers, and aid for Canadians with cystic fibrosis were also discussed.  Finally, there was a debate regarding the use of contact tracing apps and privacy concerns, and the need for a national strategy to address homelessness.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote control's design and functionality extensively.  Initially, they considered including advanced features like those found on newer televisions but questioned their relevance for a standard remote.  User research indicated a preference for basic functions like channel selection, volume control, and teletext, particularly among the target demographic of 36-65 year-olds.  The team agreed to prioritize a simple design with basic TV functions, aiming for a trendy aesthetic to appeal to a younger market. They debated incorporating DVD/VCR controls and functions for other devices but ultimately decided against it to maintain simplicity and focus on core TV features.  The team also explored adding a unique element, such as a can opener, a noise-making feature, or flashing lights, to differentiate the remote.  Changeable covers were considered to allow for personalization but raised concerns about production costs and market size.  The final design decisions included a single-curved shape, rubber buttons for a spongy feel, and a prominent, possibly apple-shaped, standby button incorporating color.  A simple circuit board was chosen to minimize costs, with voice recognition as a potential add-on. The placement of the LCD screen and button layout were also discussed, prioritizing ease of use for elderly users.\n",
    "The marketing team suggested lemon or lime colors to align with emerging European fashion trends, specifically the growing popularity of fruit and vegetable themes in clothes and furniture.  They believed incorporating this trend, combined with soft, spongy materials, would create a \"fancy look and feel,\" which market research identified as the top consumer preference for remote controls.  The team aimed to create a cohesive marketing identity, using the lemon/lime theme to inspire the product's shape, material, and color, while ensuring the innovation contributed to aesthetics rather than functionality.  They wanted to avoid a \"functional look\" and differentiate their product from competitors who were likely still using darker colors and harder materials.  The bright colors also addressed the consumer desire for easy-to-find remotes.  While the team didn't want the remote to literally resemble a piece of fruit, they wanted to evoke the associations of vibrant, natural colors and soft textures that consumers connected with lemons and limes.\n",
    "The team concluded that the remote control should be designed for ease of use by elderly people, prioritizing simplicity and functionality over advanced features.  A standard button layout will be used, likely incorporating large, easy-to-press buttons for essential functions like power, channel, and volume. Teletext functionality will be included due to its continued use by the target demographic, particularly for subtitles.  While voice control and a touchscreen were discussed, these features were ultimately rejected due to cost concerns and potential usability issues for older users.  A small LCD screen was considered to aid in explaining button functions and improve usability, but a final decision was deferred.  Similarly, a docking station with a \"find the remote\" function and recharging capabilities was discussed but not finalized due to budget constraints. The design will incorporate the company's logo and color scheme (grey and yellow) and will potentially feature interchangeable covers to allow for personalization.  Minimizing repetitive strain injuries was discussed, leading to considerations of button placement and remote control shape, but specific ergonomic adjustments haven't been finalized.  The team decided against a buttonless remote to avoid alienating users accustomed to traditional remotes.  Market research indicated a willingness among older users to pay more for a visually appealing remote, suggesting that aesthetics will be a key consideration in the final design.\n",
    "Discussions regarding the future of institutions centered on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 and its potential repeal or amendment by the Post-Compulsory Education and Training Bill.  Concerns arose regarding the Act's effectiveness in achieving its objectives: regulating institutions, safeguarding public good, maintaining fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy.  The discussion included whether the Act sufficiently addressed national outcomes and the role of the annual remit letter in driving these objectives.  Private providers and the requirement for regulated institutions to be charities were also discussed, with the Minister indicating charitable status would likely continue.  Part-time and postgraduate fees were also raised, with no current plans for regulation.  HEFCW\u2019s powers of intervention were considered inflexible and difficult to use, especially regarding swift interventions.  The Minister aimed to ensure the new commission had flexible regulatory powers, including advice and guidance, alongside more punitive measures. The discussion acknowledged the need for a graduated escalation of interventions.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues arose in the context of university governance. The Minister noted the underrepresentation of women on governing bodies (44 percent) and emphasized the need for greater diversity, including student and staff voices. The Minister also discussed attracting more women to postgraduate study through student finance reforms, highlighting a 58 percent increase in postgraduate applications.  Additionally, there was a 30 percent increase in BME learners.\n\nThe committee discussed housing affordability for students, particularly underrepresented groups.  Universities committed \u00a328 million from fee and access plans for student support, including accommodation bursaries.  Examples included Trinity Saint David's \u00a31,000 bursary for care leavers and Bangor University's targeted support, extending beyond term time.\n\nMember discussions focused on the Higher Education Act's effectiveness, financial sustainability of institutions, powers of intervention, and governance. Concerns were raised about the balance between institutional autonomy and national outcomes, the inflexibility of HEFCW's powers, and the need for greater diversity in governance. The impact of potential EU funding loss on research was also a key discussion point, with recommendations for mitigation and a focus on embedding Wales in UK-wide research conversations.\n",
    "The discussion centered on how to improve the relatively low accuracy of digit recognition within the meeting recordings. One participant noted the best accuracy achieved was 3-4%, significantly lower than the near-microphone accuracy of the SRI system, which benefited from a large amount of training data (mostly non-digit data used to train HMMs). The group questioned whether the SRI system used word models or sub-phone states for digit recognition (it used allophone models with online unsupervised adaptation, which, if removed, decreased performance by 50%). It was suggested that tandem data be fed into the SRI system to improve performance.  The group also discussed the discrepancy between the 0.8% error rate on TI-digits and the 3-4% error rate in the current system. They speculated the difference arose from the TI-digits being recorded in a controlled, unrealistic setting with clean speech, whereas the current data was more realistic, containing background noise and disfluencies. The group decided to explore other approaches to digit recognition if current performance levels persisted.  Finally, there was a brief exchange about whether the digit \"0\" should be read as \"zero\" or \"oh.\" The decision was to retain both pronunciations to mimic real-world usage.\n",
    "Marketing, the industrial designer, the user interface designer, and the project manager all recommend a speech recognition interface for the new remote.  Marketing states that between 75% and 90% of the target demographic (15-35 year-olds) are willing to pay more for speech recognition. This feature also addresses the common problem of losing the remote, as a verbal cue would allow the user to locate it.  The industrial designer concurs, suggesting a microphone array and a simple vocabulary, as well as a physical on/off switch for the feature. The user interface designer acknowledges the benefits of speech recognition, particularly the ability to trigger actions without physically finding the remote.  However, they also raise the concern of interference from ambient sounds, especially television dialogue triggering unintended actions. They suggest that a sufficiently sophisticated speech recognizer could overcome this challenge, making it a valuable marketing tool. The project manager supports the inclusion of speech recognition, believing it to be a desirable innovation that would appeal to management and consumers. They offer to connect the team with companies like Intel or IBM for technical expertise and support.\n",
    "The meetings did not include any discussion of consortia, regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, Jassa Scott, Auditor General, Bill Blair, firearms seizures at Pearson Airport, or social stability measures.  The political background and aims of the group were also not discussed. The meeting transcripts primarily consist of individual members of parliament presenting petitions on various topics and raising concerns during question periods. The topics raised included marine protected areas, indigenous rights, vaccine adverse effects, artist compensation in the digital age, medically assisted dying, religious freedom in public service, gun control, organ harvesting and trafficking, senior support, COVID-19's impact, rural internet access, social safety nets, entrepreneurship, RCMP's relationship with indigenous people, limitations on parliamentary processes, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Huawei technology, Canada's foreign policy, the state of the economy, the forestry industry, softwood lumber, COVID-19 relief measures, small business support, airline regulations, sports betting, newspaper competition with Canada Post, high-speed internet access, shipbuilding costs, military assistance in long-term care facilities, the carbon tax's impact on farmers, veterans' disability benefits backlog, and anti-racism initiatives.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's functions. Initially, they focused on basic functionalities such as power, channel selection, volume control, and mute, along with functions for VHS/DVD players (play, rewind, fast-forward, stop, pause).  They also considered including menu navigation for TV and DVD player settings like brightness.\n\nA key realization was the frequent misplacement of remotes. This led to brainstorming a \"lost-and-found\" function. Ideas included a beeping mechanism activated by a button on a charging base (similar to cordless phones), a whistle/clap-activated response, or even speech recognition where the remote responds to a specific phrase like, \"Where's the remote?\".\n\nDuring project evaluation, they discussed improvements based on user feedback. Users desired a simpler, more user-friendly remote with fewer, larger buttons.  The team considered reducing the number pad to just one through six, relying on channel up/down for higher channels. They also discussed incorporating a menu button for less frequently used functions, potentially with an LCD display.  Speech recognition was also considered, particularly for younger demographics, but concerns about cost and complexity were raised.\n\nFinally, new functions like parental controls (PIN code or channel blocking) were briefly discussed.  A \"favorites\" option for quickly accessing preferred channels was also mentioned.  Integrating the company color and slogan into the remote's design was a mandatory requirement from management.\n",
    "During the finance discussions, the group deliberated over the special colors of the buttons on the remote control prototype.  Initially, the design included several specially colored buttons, with the primary focus being a red \"apple\" button. However, due to budget constraints, the team decided to reduce the number of special colors to just two, primarily for the volume buttons, which would be a different color from the standard buttons. The other buttons on the hidden panel would remain standard colors to minimize costs.\n\nMarketing expressed dissatisfaction, not with the color changes themselves, but with the overall budget limitations that prevented the remote from aligning with the company's high-tech image. They felt that a \"cheap\" remote didn't fit with Real Reaction's other cutting-edge products and that the limited budget restricted their ability to create a truly innovative and fashionable design.  Specifically, Marketing believed a single, inexpensive remote control clashed with the company's image of producing high-quality, innovative products.\n",
    "Regarding the Welsh dimension, witnesses suggested that resources should be developed bilingually from the outset, rather than translated, to avoid clunky or difficult-to-understand wording.  One witness noted the importance of nurturing Welsh authors to ensure the Welsh dimension is adequately represented in curriculum materials, particularly in light of the new curriculum's emphasis on this aspect.\n\nThere was a consensus that employers lacked a clear understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate.  Suggestions for improvement included reviewing the qualification with significant employer input, focusing on employability and entrepreneurial skills, and better communication with employers about the qualification's value. Some witnesses felt the Welsh Baccalaureate's value was overshadowed by other programs like Career Ready and WorldSkills, which offered more direct engagement with employers.\n\nThe discussion around an independent inspection body for Wales did not appear in these transcripts.  Instead, the conversation centered on Estyn\u2019s role in evaluating schools and the Welsh Baccalaureate. There was concern that variability in the quality of Welsh Baccalaureate programs among schools stemmed from inconsistencies across the education sector.  The qualifications regulator, in conjunction with the WJEC, aimed to address this through greater consistency in delivery and by making the Baccalaureate a dedicated performance measure for schools.\n",
    "The group generally found the provided presentation materials inconvenient and insufficient for collaborative design work.  They felt restricted by the meeting structure, which emphasized individual work followed by presentations, rather than collaborative brainstorming.  Specifically, the reliance on PowerPoint presentations and pre-populated slides limited their ability to visually explore ideas and build upon each other's contributions.  They would have preferred a more fluid approach using whiteboards or shared digital spaces where ideas could be sketched, discussed, and iterated upon in real-time. The digital pens, while intuitive to use, were considered clunky and disruptive due to the page-turning and note-taking process.  The team also found it cumbersome to be limited to in-meeting communication, expressing a need for more flexible communication channels to facilitate quick questions and idea sharing outside of formal meeting times.  While the Play-Doh used for prototyping was highly praised for its tactile and creative benefits, the overall sentiment was that the provided digital tools and meeting structure hindered collaborative teamwork and creative exploration.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed incorporating an LCD screen into the remote's design.  Initially, there was concern about the cost of LCD screens and the more advanced chip required to operate them, potentially making the remote too expensive.  However, the team acknowledged that an LCD screen offered several advantages. It allowed for a sleeker, more modern design that could be perceived as \"fancy\" by consumers, potentially justifying a higher price point.  Also, LCD screens simplified the interface by allowing for dynamic menus and reducing the number of physical buttons, which could be appealing to younger demographics.  The team ultimately decided to proceed with the LCD screen, contingent on receiving cost information and ensuring it aligned with their target market and overall budget.  They acknowledged the need for a backup plan involving traditional buttons if the LCD proved too costly.\n",
    "The group began by introducing themselves and their roles (industrial designer, user interface, marketing, and project manager). They then reviewed the project from the previous meeting: a snowman-shaped remote control with kinetic and battery power, rubber buttons, a jog dial, and the company slogan. Due to cost, the snowman shape and kinetic power were abandoned. The group brainstormed alternative designs, deciding on a simpler LCD screen with a scroll wheel and confirm button to access advanced features like brightness and contrast. They discussed the remote's size, aiming for a palm-sized device with 1 cm buttons.  The slogan placement and case color were also discussed.\n\nNext, the group evaluated the project's feasibility using an Excel pricing sheet. They discovered they were over budget and had to make further cuts, including removing the LCD screen and advanced chip. The final design became a single-curved case with a simplified button interface and a single color.  They decided to rely on the TV screen to display the selected functions.\n\nThe group then evaluated the project process, discussing room for creativity, leadership, and teamwork. They felt the structured environment and pre-determined roles limited their creative input.  The leadership was considered too controlling, hindering teamwork and collaboration. They also discussed the effectiveness of the tools provided, finding the whiteboard helpful but underutilized, while the digital pens and multiple computers proved distracting. The group concluded by suggesting improvements for future projects, such as more relaxed brainstorming sessions, earlier prototyping, and better communication tools.\n",
    "The team discussed rechargeable units as a possibility for the remote. The industrial designer mentioned standard double A and triple A batteries, dynamo charging, solar charging, and kinetic charging. Dynamo charging was considered impractical. Solar charging was deemed expensive and not resistant to drops. Kinetic charging, similar to that used in watches, was seen as a viable option, as the small movements of picking up and putting down the remote could generate sufficient power. The team also considered a dual power option combining standard batteries with solar charging, but this was dismissed as detracting from the remote's aesthetic appeal. Ultimately, the team favored kinetic charging with a small watch battery, pending cost analysis and further investigation.  They also discussed the possibility of rechargeable lithium batteries lasting 20 years, even with a touchscreen, but questioned the cost and market viability.\n",
    "The group discussed the nonuniformity of microphones and how it affected various aspects of the project, including transcription, speaker identification, and discourse analysis.  They acknowledged the superior quality of the head-mounted microphones compared to the lapel microphones, especially for transcribers. The discomfort of the current head-mounted microphones was also noted.  They decided to acquire one head-mounted Crown CM311AE headset with a different, more comfortable headband as a trial. If deemed preferable, they would then order nine identical Crown headsets for uniformity.  A secondary issue concerned accommodating more than eight speakers.  The current system only supported two eight-channel boards, limiting the number of microphones. To address this, they proposed a handheld wireless microphone to be passed around to additional speakers. They would investigate compatibility with the existing receiver or if a separate system was required.\n",
    "Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty\u2019s Chief Inspector at Estyn, expressed concern regarding the challenges secondary schools face, particularly around deficits, staffing issues, and preparing for the new curriculum.  He noted that secondary schools are in a more challenging position than primary schools in adapting to the curriculum changes, partly due to funding constraints limiting their capacity for professional development and planning.  He advocated for a two-pronged approach to address these challenges, emphasizing improvements to teaching and learning, and a community-focused approach for schools, acknowledging the difficulty of academic progress when students face significant home-life difficulties.  Rowlands also highlighted concerns about the quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools, which have shown little improvement, and the need for additional support for struggling schools.  He suggested that additional funding should be prioritized for teacher training and for schools facing the greatest challenges.  Finally, he acknowledged concerns regarding student well-being in secondary schools, particularly the decline in student confidence regarding emotional and mental health support.  He attributed this decline to a number of factors including increased challenges faced by teenagers, their more discerning observations regarding well-being support in school, and the difficulty secondary schools have in providing adequate pastoral care, particularly during times of tight budgets.\n\nKirsty Williams AM, the Minister for Education, discussed the challenges of ensuring student safety during the pandemic.  She emphasized that the decision to close schools was difficult but necessary, based on public health advice.  She outlined the Welsh Government's plans to repurpose schools to support vulnerable children and the children of key workers, ensuring the continuation of free school meals and special needs provision. Williams acknowledged the difficulties faced by vulnerable children at home, and the efforts being made to reach out to families and provide support through hubs and check-ins.  She discussed the importance of testing, tracing, and quarantine measures for the next phase of pandemic response, and the need to build confidence among parents and staff before reopening schools more broadly.  Williams highlighted the challenges of remote learning, particularly the digital divide and lack of access to technology for less affluent families, and the efforts being made to address this through national procurement and distribution of hardware and connectivity solutions.  She also discussed the cancellation of exams and the approach being taken to ensure fair grading for students, taking into account teacher assessments, coursework, and moderation.  Finally, she addressed concerns about the mental health and well-being of students and staff, emphasizing the need for ongoing support and the provision of online counselling and other resources.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer focused on the remote's physical form and usability. They initially expressed concern about balancing design with functionality, noting the limitations of form in achieving all desired functions. They questioned the practicality of a hinged, spherical design, suggesting it would likely remain open most of the time.  The Industrial Designer also highlighted the importance of considering the remote's stability and durability, especially given its intended use by children. They emphasized the need for a compromise between stability and design, suggesting a flat bottom to prevent rolling. They also raised the issue of user interaction, proposing the remote should be easily grasped and used without needing to look at it, suggesting an intuitive design. The Industrial Designer questioned the necessity of a lid, citing stability concerns and the likelihood of it being left open. They also pointed out the balance between product durability and sales, acknowledging that more breakages could lead to increased sales. Finally, they advocated for a design that clearly indicates which end should be pointed at the television for optimal functionality.\n",
    "The committee members and Welsh Government officials expressed serious concerns regarding Erasmus+ funding in the context of Brexit.  They emphasized the importance of Erasmus+ for Welsh students and the potential negative impact of losing access to the program. They acknowledged that only 40% of Cardiff University student mobility funding comes from Erasmus+, with the university covering the remaining costs.  The committee discussed whether universities should commit to funding international mobility programs from their own fee income. While some universities already incorporate mobility targets in their fee and access plans, the committee recognized the established nature and efficiency of Erasmus+ and the potential difficulties in replicating it.\n\nRegarding tuition fee refunds, the committee and government officials did not explicitly discuss refunding a portion of tuition fees to students. However, they extensively discussed the financial pressures on universities resulting from Brexit, including potential drops in EU student enrollment due to changes in fee structures. The Welsh Government emphasized its commitment to the Diamond reforms, designed to make higher education more affordable and accessible for students from poorer backgrounds, including providing a living wage through grants and loans without parental contributions. The committee also raised concerns about the financial sustainability of universities, given existing deficits and uncertainties surrounding Brexit's impact on funding and student recruitment.  The overall focus was on ensuring the long-term financial stability of the higher education sector and mitigating the potential negative effects of Brexit on student access and university resources, rather than direct tuition fee refunds.\n",
    "Meeting discussions centered on data collection strategies for Meeting Recorder development, including using CrossPads for note-taking and capturing visual information of meeting spaces.  Participants debated the ethical and legal implications of data release, proposing methods for obtaining informed consent from meeting participants before sharing transcripts with researchers.  They also discussed generating meaningful queries for the system, considering summaries, participant-identified \"interesting\" points, and action items as potential query sources.  The limitations of relying solely on summaries were acknowledged, as they might not capture information relevant to future queries.  Using CrossPads, while potentially useful, was contingent upon project lead availability.  The importance of diverse meeting types and participant demographics for data collection was also emphasized, along with the need for efficient data formats and storage solutions, including the possibility of bleeping sensitive information.  Finally, the group touched on transcriber feedback, noting the importance of accurate transcripts for both system development and participant approval.\n",
    "Expressions of thanks were extended to the House of Commons, specifically for adapting to virtual meeting formats and continuing their work throughout the pandemic.  Gratitude was also directed towards the Canadian Armed Forces for their service in Operation LASER, assisting in long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis.  Several members commended the military's efforts in providing care to seniors and reporting on the conditions within these facilities.  This recognition stemmed from the military's deployment to long-term care homes in Ontario and Quebec, where they addressed critical staffing shortages and provided essential support.\n",
    "The group discussed the functions, characteristics, and design requirements of a television remote control.  Consumers desire remotes with intuitive interfaces, fewer buttons, and aesthetically pleasing designs that complement their living spaces.  Channel and volume buttons are the most frequently used features, while power, though less used, is considered highly relevant.  Users expressed frustration with losing remotes and the learning curve associated with new devices.  Some also noted that repetitive button pressing could lead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI).  The inclusion of an LCD screen and speech recognition capabilities appealed more to younger demographics.  A docking station was also considered.\n\nThe prioritized functional requirement is simplifying the user experience by reducing the number of buttons.  This could involve a scroll wheel for channel selection, potentially combined with volume control, to replace the traditional number pad.  Although some members raised concerns about older users' comfort levels with a scroll wheel, others argued that clear advertising could overcome this hurdle.  The scroll feature would address the user frustration of repeatedly pressing the channel button.  Additionally, an LCD screen could display help functions, further simplifying the user experience.\n",
    "The upcoming team meeting will focus on finalizing the design of the remote control.  The team will make a final decision regarding the remote's details, including the look and feel, the user interface, and specifications like dimensions and button layout.  They will revisit the initial design goals, including kinetic power, rubber buttons, a jog dial, and incorporating the company slogan.  Cost is a major constraint, and the team has already made compromises, such as eliminating the LCD screen and advanced chip to reduce the price.  They will further discuss the remote's shape, size, and the possibility of using different colors or button shapes to enhance its stylishness while adhering to the company's branding.\n\nMarketing brought up the issue of repetitive strain injury (RSI) related to prolonged remote control use.  This prompted a discussion about ergonomics and the need to design a remote that minimizes the risk of RSI.  The possibility of touch-sensitive buttons was suggested.\n\nReflecting on past meetings and progress, the team found the current meeting format less conducive to creativity.  They felt restricted by the structured agenda and limited communication outside of formal meetings.  The team also discussed the effectiveness of the tools used, finding the whiteboard helpful but underutilized.  They suggested having a physical prototype earlier in the design process to facilitate brainstorming and discussion.  The digital pens were considered intuitive but somewhat clunky.  The team also found having multiple computers distracting and suggested a more collaborative environment for future projects.  They expressed a desire for more brainstorming and idea exchange throughout the design process.\n",
    "Lab test findings regarding button design were not discussed in these meetings.  The groups extensively discussed the finder button (for locating the remote), initially favoring a sound-emitting function. Concerns arose about its efficacy if the television volume was high and cost-effectiveness.  A \"clapping\" technique was considered, mimicking a sound peak.  The team ultimately decided to include the function if feasible within cost constraints, tasking the industrial designer with exploring solutions but acknowledging the added technical complexity.  The inclusion of a \"home\" button on the television itself was dismissed as impractical.\n\nThe teams discussed button design details, including shape, size, color, and tactile feel. They considered a joystick or a four-directional button as alternatives to traditional buttons, prioritizing ease of use and a trendy appearance to attract younger consumers. The number of buttons was debated, with options ranging from a minimal set with shift functions to a full ten-digit keypad.\n\nThe group favored a simple, trendy design with a few buttons, distinctive lighting effects, and the sound-emitting finder function.  They sought to balance user-friendliness with innovative features.  Regarding lighting, they agreed on LEDs for their power efficiency and aesthetic appeal, discussing the possibility of illuminating all buttons rather than individual ones.  They also explored lighting adaptive options, such as a glow-in-the-dark concept, but ultimately prioritized the finder function over extensive lighting features.  The final prototype featured raised buttons with symbols for international marketability and a prominent on/off button.  A unique \"oyster-shaped\" holder was also incorporated into the design.  Cost constraints led to some design compromises, including using a plastic casing instead of rubber and potentially sacrificing the ideal placement of the LCD screen for ambidextrous use.\n",
    "The team discussed the DAT format as the delivery method for audio data to IBM for transcription.  They acknowledged the limitations of using only close-talking microphones for overlap detection and expressed the need for distant microphones to capture a more realistic acoustic environment. The team also discussed the importance of capturing subject intention during data collection.  They considered inferring intention from linguistic features, context (situational and discourse), and even time of day.  They also explored using a belief-net to combine these factors and infer intention, with the initial focus on distinguishing between \"Vista\" (viewing), \"Enter\" (entering), and \"Tango\" (close approach) modes. The crude parser output (M-3-L/intention lattices) was deemed insufficient for deep understanding, requiring additional information such as object type and discourse history.  To gather richer data, they planned to conduct user studies in a controlled environment, presenting subjects with scenarios and tasks to elicit natural language queries and intentions.  The team planned to use a belief-net to model the relationship between linguistic features, context, and intention, with the goal of improving the system's ability to understand user requests.  They also considered collecting additional data from various sources, including note-taking during meetings, post-meeting summaries, and potentially collaborating with other research groups or using \"found data\" such as broadcast recordings.  To address the transcription bottleneck, they suggested using close-talking microphones to generate a first-pass transcription, followed by manual correction and refinement. They also discussed the possibility of using echo cancellation techniques to improve audio quality and explored alternative data collection methods such as using CrossPads and capturing visual information like board content and participant positions.\n",
    "The group discussed various aspects of the remote control's general specifications and case design.  A key decision involved rejecting changeable cases due to the company's logo needing to be on each case, negating the cost-saving benefit.  They opted for a single-curve, rubberized case in fruit and vegetable colors for a \u201cspongy feel\u201d to align with current fashion trends, prioritizing \u201cfancy look and feel.\u201d  The team decided on a simple printed circuit board with push buttons to keep costs down, forgoing the scroll wheel, although this feature was revisited several times.  An LCD screen located on the top part of the flip-top design was chosen for displaying the menu, with frequently used buttons like volume and channel located on the bottom part of the flip case for thumb access.  Voice recognition, specifically a \u201cfind-me\u201d function, was considered a desirable feature, but cost remained a concern.  The team aimed for a sleek and simple design, prioritizing ease of use while incorporating trendy elements.  They decided against shaping the remote like a fruit or vegetable, opting instead for vibrant colors.  The standby button was singled out as a possible location to subtly incorporate the trend, perhaps by shaping it like an apple.  The team acknowledged the need to balance functionality with aesthetics and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "Huw David expressed support for the Bill, emphasizing the state's role in protecting children from harm and highlighting the changing cultural norms in Wales, where physical punishment is increasingly rejected by parents. He stressed the importance of careful implementation with adequate resources, particularly given the strain on social services.  David acknowledged potential unintended consequences if implementation is not managed effectively, but believed these could be mitigated with proper resourcing.  He supported a major awareness campaign to educate families and ensure support services are available for parents struggling with discipline.  He didn't believe explicit inclusion of awareness campaigns and support services in the Bill was essential, trusting the Welsh Government's commitment, but later advocated for their inclusion as a duty on the government.  David believed the current law creates ambiguity for vulnerable children who may not understand the boundaries of acceptable discipline. He clarified that the Bill aims to establish a clear line, empowering children to seek help if needed.  He also noted that the Bill does not intend to criminalize parents or lead to extensive social service involvement in families' lives, emphasizing a proportionate response to any reported incidents.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the two-sided remote control's design and functionality.  A major consideration was the target market.  Initially, the team aimed for a broad market with a multi-device remote. However, due to time-to-market constraints, they narrowed their focus to a TV-only remote control, specifically targeting elderly users (60-80 years old). This decision stemmed from market research indicating that this demographic constituted a significant portion of the market and were less critical of advanced features.\n\nThe team explored various features, including:\n\n* **Reduced Button Count:**  Driven by findings that most users only utilize a small percentage of buttons on a remote, the team aimed for a simplified button layout.\n* **Backlighting:**  The possibility of illuminated buttons for use in the dark was suggested.\n* **Waterproof/Shockproof Capabilities:**  While waterproofing was considered, concerns about added cost and existing user practices (covering remotes with plastic) led to it being potentially bundled as an optional accessory. Shock resistance was deemed important due to potential drops.\n* **Two-sided Design/Ergonomics:**  A two-sided design was proposed to address potential Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) and accommodate both left and right-handed users. The final decision favored a traditional single-sided layout for ease of use.\n* **\"Lost Remote\" Feature:**  A beeping function to locate a misplaced remote, potentially integrated into a docking station, was favored.\n* **LCD Screen:** A small LCD screen to display button information for ease of use by elderly users was considered essential.  A larger, more complex screen (similar to a mobile phone) was discussed but dismissed due to cost and relevance to the target market.\n* **Docking Station:**  A docking station was considered highly valuable, serving both as a charging station and a location for the \"lost remote\" function.\n* **Kinetic Energy vs. Battery:** Kinetic energy charging was discussed but ultimately rejected in favor of a standard battery rechargeable via the docking station.\n* **Interchangeable Covers:**  Interchangeable covers (wood-like and grey-black) were proposed to enhance aesthetics and appeal to the target demographic.\n* **Voice Control:**  Voice control was initially considered but ultimately deemed too costly for this specific product and market.\n\nThe final design leaned towards a simple, user-friendly remote with a small LCD screen, docking station, and interchangeable covers.  The focus was on functionality, ease of use, and appealing to the specific needs and preferences of the elderly target market.\n",
    "Group 3's amendments centered on the Bill's commencement and transitional provisions.  Julie Morgan introduced amendment 3, aiming to reinstate the existing power for Welsh Ministers to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions related to Section 1's implementation. This power was initially removed due to the proposed removal of the Minister's ability to set the commencement date via an Order. Amendment 6 ensured this reinstated power would come into effect the day after Royal Assent.  These were presented as technical amendments, with Morgan stating they were needed to ensure the statutory instrument had the necessary functionality, despite the shift away from the Minister setting the date.  She argued against broader powers, claiming they weren\u2019t needed.  She confirmed her willingness to discuss this further before Stage 3.\n\nSuzy Davies proposed amendment 3A as a probing amendment.  She questioned whether the proposed powers were sufficient, given the additions of an awareness campaign and reporting duties to Section 1. Davies suggested broader regulatory powers might be required for effective implementation of the amended Section 1, going beyond simply transitory provisions.  Amendment 3A served as a placeholder, anticipating further discussion in Stage 3 regarding the scope of powers needed for implementation. Davies expressed concern about the Assembly's limited influence over the content of the awareness campaign, particularly if the government chose to introduce specifics through regulations without Assembly input.  She favored a more collaborative approach, ensuring the Assembly's involvement in shaping the awareness-raising efforts.  Suzy Davies acknowledged the government's stated preference for not having wider powers but was concerned about unforeseen connections to other bills or circumstances that may necessitate such powers.  She also sought clarification about the process for discussing these concerns further before Stage 3.\n",
    "Brexit significantly impacts Welsh higher education institutions, primarily through decreased EU student applications, creating financial pressures.  The shift in student support arrangements, eliminating tuition fee grants for EU students, is a major contributing factor to the application decline, putting Welsh institutions on par with England but removing a previous recruitment advantage.  This is compounded by pre-existing funding gaps between Welsh and English institutions, the demographic dip in 18-year-olds, and uncertainties surrounding the Augar review in England.  \n\nExecutives are actively working to mitigate these challenges.  A Welsh Government HE Brexit working group collaborates with institutions to identify risks and potential impacts, informing governmental policy and discussions with the UK government. Institutions are developing contingency plans and exploring alternative funding sources, with a focus on promoting Welsh HE internationally through initiatives like the Global Wales program.  They are also actively working to maintain access to research funding, particularly Horizon Europe.  HEFCW monitors institutional financial health, including forecasts, reserves, and debt management, intervening when necessary to protect student interests.  Efforts are also underway to increase transparency around fee income usage.\n\nWhile the meeting transcripts do not contain any specific questioning about local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks, they do not contain information regarding projects awaiting government approval in Canadian provinces.\n",
    "Discussions across multiple meetings reveal several key concerns regarding Canada\u2019s vulnerable populations, especially the elderly, and the role of government in providing support.  Long-term care homes emerged as a significant point of concern, with reports from the Canadian Armed Forces exposing neglect and substandard conditions in several facilities.  This prompted calls for national standards, increased federal oversight, and investigations into the for-profit model prevalent in the sector.  While the federal government acknowledged the gravity of the situation, representatives repeatedly emphasized provincial jurisdiction over long-term care, committing to collaboration and support but stopping short of direct intervention.\n\nFinancial support for seniors and vulnerable individuals was another recurring theme.  Concerns were raised about the adequacy of existing programs like Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), with calls for increases to these benefits to address the rising cost of living exacerbated by the pandemic.  While the government announced a one-time payment for seniors, it was criticized as insufficient and a temporary fix.  The exclusion of people with disabilities from this payment also drew criticism.  The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) was discussed, with questions about its accessibility for various groups, including seniors, and concerns about potential fraud.  Debate arose regarding the government's approach to supporting businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with criticism directed at eligibility criteria and the perceived prioritization of larger corporations.  The government defended its programs, citing their broad reach and flexibility, while acknowledging the need for ongoing adjustments.\n",
    "The marketing expert believes the product fulfills user requirements and aligns with company strategy regarding customer needs, technology, and environmental safety.  She notes current fashion trends favor fruit and vegetable shapes and simple designs, aligning with the product's banana shape and minimal buttons. However, she expresses concern about the limited design options, suggesting a wider variety of fruit shapes would broaden appeal, referencing the diverse shapes of candies as an example. She questions the product's innovativeness due to the lack of an LCD screen and features like solar power, despite the inclusion of voice recognition. She also believes the product's ease of use is average, acknowledging voice recognition's learning curve while noting its potential for advanced users. Regarding robustness, she considers the rubber casing a positive attribute. She also highlights the potential of voice recognition to expand functionality and compares the product favorably to similarly shaped wireless phones with higher price points.  Overall, she believes the product is good but could benefit from expanded design choices and more innovative features.\n",
    "The Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was enacted with four primary objectives: regulating Welsh institutions, safeguarding public good derived from government funding, maintaining a focus on fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy.  Debate centered on whether the Act successfully achieved these aims. Concerns arose regarding the Act's limitations in driving national outcomes, with some arguing that reliance on annual remit letters, rather than robust legislation, was necessary to influence institutional behavior.  The effectiveness of fee and access plans was questioned, with a preference expressed for longer-term, outcome-focused approaches rather than annual input-based plans.  The Act's treatment of private providers was also discussed. The requirement for regulated institutions to hold charitable status, thereby excluding some private providers, was debated, though the government indicated its intention to retain this provision.  Finally, the regulation of part-time and postgraduate fees was considered, but no urgent need for intervention was identified, given current fee levels and the success of recent student finance reforms.\n",
    "The group discussed and presented evaluations of their remote control design based on several criteria.  These criteria included ease of use, fashionable appearance, tactile feel, technological innovation, and whether the product was \"squishy and fruity,\" reflecting a desired playful and trendy image.  A seven-point rating scale was used, with one being the highest score.  The team generally agreed on scores of two or three for \"fancy look and feel\" and technological innovation, acknowledging the limitations of the prototype and some removed features. They gave a higher rating, around seven, for ease of use and \"fashion,\" confident in the intuitive design and fruit-inspired theme.  Robustness was also rated highly, due to the rubber casing.  The overall evaluation was deemed positive, with an average score estimated around 69% or 70%, indicating satisfaction with the design despite some compromises.  Additional discussion focused on the design process itself.  The team felt somewhat restricted by the initial brief and the meeting format, believing it hampered creativity and teamwork. They suggested more flexible brainstorming sessions and better communication tools to improve collaboration. The use of physical prototypes earlier in the process was also recommended to facilitate discussion and idea generation.  They found the digital pens clunky and the reliance on PowerPoint presentations limiting, preferring the whiteboard for its interactive potential.\n",
    "Participants generally agreed that CD backups, while common for distributions like those from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), are unreliable for long-term archival due to degradation, particularly with burned CDs.  They favored tape backup for archival, with the existing robotic system seen as convenient.  The discussion touched upon automating the process and minimizing impact on the nightly backups, potentially by using non-backed-up disks and a separate manual tape burning utility.\n\nThe probability computation discussion centered on optimizing a speech recognition system, specifically using Baum-Welch training with a fixed number of iterations.  Concerns were raised about potential overfitting, the impact of pruning thresholds given different likelihood ranges between PLP and mel cepstrum features, and the influence of boot models trained with different feature sets.  The use of vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and its impact on male versus female speech recognition accuracy was also discussed.  Further experimentation with a larger training dataset and VTLN applied during training was planned.\n\nThe SmartKom experimental setup involves a \"Wizard of Oz\" paradigm where a participant interacts with a simulated computer system, believing it to be automated until a simulated \"breakdown\" reveals a human operator.  This design allows for comparing human-computer and human-human dialogue within the same session.  The setup includes far-field and close-talking microphones, with debate on whether to include this data within the existing meeting corpus or treat it as a separate entity given its scenario-based nature. The group also discussed incorporating aspects like time of day, landmark properties (\"nice walls,\" enterable), and user context (tourist, business) as features in a belief network for intention recognition within the navigation task.\n",
    "The team opted against placing channel and volume buttons on both sides of the remote due to concerns about ease of use.  While acknowledging potential design benefits, they felt that such a layout would increase complexity for the user. The Project Manager's suggestion of a reversible remote, usable by both right- and left-handed individuals, was deemed unnecessary. The team concluded that the remote's basic functions were simple enough to be operated with either hand, regardless of a person's dominant hand.\n",
    "The team discussed cost reduction strategies throughout the meetings.  Initially, they explored a basic remote control design costing eight Euros, significantly below the 12.50 Euro target. The project manager suggested reinvesting the saved amount to increase the remote's value. The team explored various features like an LCD screen, integrated microphone, and removable covers.  However, cost concerns led to discussions about abandoning certain features. The speech recognition system, initially included, was deemed too expensive at three Euros per unit and ultimately removed. The LCD screen's inclusion was debated due to its cost, but the team recognized its market appeal, particularly for the target demographic of 20-40 year-olds.  To reduce production costs, the team considered using a plastic casing instead of rubber and simplifying the design to a single-curved form.  They also explored reducing the number of buttons and potentially removing the LCD screen.  Ultimately, the team prioritized the LCD screen and aimed to maintain a single-curved design with a plastic casing to stay within the revised budget of 12.50 Euros.  The final design included a scroll wheel, locator, basic TV functions, and a cradle.  The locator's inclusion was uncertain due to cost constraints.  The team's decisions reflect a focus on balancing cost reduction with maintaining desirable features for market appeal.\n",
    "The meeting participants discussed voice recognition primarily in the context of transcribing their meetings.  A \"no frills\" recognizer, trained on Switchboard data, achieved encouraging results on 20 minutes of transcribed meeting audio, with word error rates comparable to Switchboard evaluations.  However, this recognizer lacked adaptation, cross-word models, and trigrams, relying only on bigrams.  It was noted that the language model included Broadcast News data, though with less weight than Switchboard.  Concerns arose regarding the recognizer's handling of meeting-specific terminology like \"PZM\" and \"Jimlet,\" for which no language model existed.  Further work was suggested, including language model adaptation using meeting transcripts, and exploring the impact of using full-band acoustic models versus telephone bandwidth models.  The quality of lapel microphones was deemed significantly lower than head-mounted microphones, impacting transcription accuracy.  The possibility of using microphone arrays was discussed but tabled due to infrastructure complexities and the primary research focus on impromptu speech scenarios.  Finally, the importance of accurate force alignment for extracting prosodic information and speaker overlaps was highlighted, along with the need for linguists to assess the quality of the alignment boundaries.\n",
    "The team discussed various battery options for the remote control, including standard double and triple A batteries, dynamo charging, solar charging, and kinetic charging. The Industrial Designer (ID) felt that double and triple A batteries were too bulky, a dynamo would be silly and take up too much space, and solar charging, while potentially useful, presented design challenges due to the size and fragility of solar cells.  They also noted the expense of solar cells. The ID favored kinetic charging, similar to that used in watches, believing it would provide sufficient power for the remote\u2019s infrequent use. The team also considered a dual charging system with both solar and standard batteries, but the ID felt this would detract from the design\u2019s aesthetics. The ID believed the kinetic charging option, coupled with the remote\u2019s unique shape and portability, offered an original and practical solution.  The team ultimately decided on kinetic charging with a watch-type battery.  Although concerned about the kinetic battery's ability to hold a charge, the ID noted that kinetic watches, despite constant movement, do not run out of power overnight.  The team agreed to conduct market research regarding customer acceptance of a kinetic charging option.  A charger, specifically the kinetic charging method, was chosen for the industrial working design because it aligned with the goals of creating a small, portable device with a unique shape. It also offered a long-lasting power solution without requiring replaceable batteries.\n",
    "The team developing the remote control never explicitly discussed submitting their project to a conference.  They were tasked by the company's leadership to design a new remote control.  During the project debriefing, they discussed the success of their teamwork, design, and innovative features like the interchangeable covers and considered the possibility that their design might be adopted by major electronics companies.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM did not directly discuss funding allocated to consortia.  She did, however, discuss HEFCW funding allocations and cuts, expressing concern about the potential impact on part-time learning. She highlighted that the Welsh Government has made efforts to support part-time students through parity of support with full-time students and expressed pride in the increased uptake of part-time courses.\n\nRegarding university governance, Williams acknowledged concerns raised by the University and College Union.  She noted that the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 does not directly address governance but highlighted ongoing efforts to improve it. These included her direct engagement with university chairs, an independent review of governance led by Gillian Camm, and exploring the inclusion of a regulatory condition for good governance in the forthcoming PCET Bill.  She also expressed concern about the lack of diversity in university governing bodies.\n\nWilliams stated that she had no formal policy on university mergers, emphasizing her focus on a healthy and sustainable higher education sector. She acknowledged the potential disruption mergers can cause and indicated a preference for collaboration between institutions.  She noted that HEFCW was undertaking a review of past university mergers to inform future policy.\n\nDiscussions about university admission problems focused primarily on teacher training.  Williams cited difficulties in recruiting and retaining teachers, particularly for secondary schools and Welsh-medium education.  Proposed solutions included increasing financial incentives, establishing an advisory board on teacher recruitment and retention, exploring employment-based training routes, introducing a part-time PGCE, and implementing recommendations from an evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE.  She also emphasized the importance of increasing diversity in the teaching workforce, including attracting career changers.  There was discussion about the sharp decline in individuals entering teacher training for Welsh-medium instruction and the need for ambitious targets and a \"step change\" to reverse this trend.  The discussion also covered the importance of supporting existing teachers with Welsh language skills to teach through the medium of Welsh.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's energy source, technology, and overall design.  They initially considered kinetic energy, appreciating its novelty and convenience, but acknowledged cost and development constraints.  Standard batteries remained a viable alternative.  Solar energy was deemed impractical due to potential light limitations and incompatibility with the desired spongy casing.  The team favored a rubber exterior for its tactile appeal and ergonomic benefits, possibly with a hard inner shell to protect components.  Titanium, while stylish, was deemed too expensive and unsuitable for complex shapes.  Push-button technology, a company strength, was selected for the interface, supplemented by an on-screen menu navigable via a four-directional button with a central \"enter\" function. This approach simplified the remote's physical design, reducing cost and complexity.  A minimalist aesthetic was preferred, possibly resembling a child's remote, with bright, vegetable-inspired colors and a spongy, perhaps fruit-shaped, cover. The company's colors might be incorporated into the buttons.  An LCD screen on the remote was rejected in favor of displaying information on the television screen.  This streamlined the remote's design and leveraged the existing TV interface.  The team concluded the meeting with clear design directions, assigning further development to the industrial and user interface designers, with the marketing expert focusing on product evaluation.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed technical issues, including the types of chips to use, the incorporation of an LCD screen and a speaker, and the possibility of voice control.  They also explored different power source options, including batteries, solar cells, a hand crank, and kinetic power.  Ultimately, they leaned towards a hybrid approach with a battery supplemented by kinetic power generated through user movement.\n\nA significant portion of the discussion revolved around the remote's design.  Inspired by current fashion trends, the team considered a fruit or vegetable theme, particularly focusing on a lemon or banana shape due to the company's yellow corporate color. They also debated the use of materials, favoring a combination of plastic and rubber to achieve a soft, comfortable feel.  The placement and design of buttons, including the possibility of a jog dial for channel and volume control, were also key discussion points.  The team aimed for a sleek, modern aesthetic, avoiding the bulky, button-laden appearance of traditional remotes.  They also explored ways to incorporate the company logo and slogan, considering options such as placing them on the casing or having the device speak the slogan when activated.  Although an email mentioned a sample sensor/speaker chip and voice control technology that could respond to user questions, these features were not finalized.  A prototype was planned using modeling clay to further refine the chosen concept.\n",
    "The last meeting primarily focused on data collection strategies and user interface design for the Meeting Recorder project.  A key discussion revolved around generating meaningful queries for the system.  Participants debated using summaries for query bootstrapping, noting their limitations, especially the potential bias towards information deemed important at the time of summarization, which might not align with future research needs.  Alternative suggestions included capturing participant's \"most interesting\" takeaways, leveraging \"action item\" phrases, and incorporating note-taking timestamps for query generation.\n\nData collection methods were also reviewed.  Using CrossPads for time-stamped notes was discussed, but concerns about noise and infrastructure were raised.  Digitally photographing whiteboards and table arrangements was proposed to provide meeting context, along with potentially anonymizing participant faces for privacy.  The team also briefly touched upon incorporating video data, acknowledging potential participant reluctance.  Regarding data storage, the group was nearing capacity on their current setup, with plans to consult with Dave Johnson about acquiring and integrating additional disk space.  Finally, a brief update on transcription efforts was provided, with some data awaiting processing by IBM, while other portions were being transcribed internally.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies AM expressed several concerns regarding the childcare offer.  David was worried about the administrative burden on local authorities of collecting wage slips, birth certificates, and other documentation to determine eligibility.  He questioned the feasibility of implementing a centralized, HMRC-like system by 2020, as well as the uneven distribution of demand and the potential fragility of the childcare sector.  David also raised the issue of the affordability of add-on costs such as food and transportation for low-income families given the national rate of \u00a34.50.  He questioned the fairness of this system, suggesting subsidies for grandparents providing childcare or a lower top-end income limit for eligibility.\n\nIrranca-Davies defended the current system, highlighting its phased rollout and the lessons learned from early implementation. He stressed the Welsh Government\u2019s focus on registered childcare providers to ensure quality, and acknowledged ongoing discussions about the inclusion of registered grandparent carers.  He expressed confidence in the foundational sector\u2019s ability to expand capacity and defended the \u00a34.50 rate as appropriate and welcomed by providers.  Irranca-Davies acknowledged the potential for add-on costs to create inequities, but argued that parents are accustomed to navigating these differences and that the current model provides transparency and affordability for the government.  He emphasized that the bill allows for future adjustments to be made to the program.  Both he and Jo-Anne Daniels also pointed out that the \u00a34.50 rate is higher than the average rate in England, and that it has been positively received because it avoids the complexities of England's variable rate system.\n",
    "PhD C worked on on-line normalization, experimenting with different means for silence and speech, controlled by a voice activity detector (VAD).  They observed that the means differed more for C-zero and C-one coefficients. C-one exhibited strange behavior, with the silence portion's mean varying across different noises. PhD C also explored adjusting the time constant, making it smaller at the utterance's beginning for faster adaptation.  They also investigated differences between systems, noting the LDA filters were not the same, and using filters derived from clean speech resulted in a significant performance jump.  PhD C also experimented with adding white noise energy below the utterance\u2019s maximum energy, observing a smoothing effect on the MFCCs, but no significant change in recognition.  The professor suggested examining error types to gain more insight than simply observing whether changes improved overall performance.\n\nPhD F primarily discussed phase normalization. Initial attempts using a long-term mean subtraction approach yielded poor results.  They were also working with other researchers on language modeling for a far-mike speech recognition system, and planned to adapt a Broadcast News net on data resembling read speech.  PhD F also discussed alternative phase normalization methods, such as using complex arithmetic and avoiding polar representation.  They experimented with phase unwrapping, but obtained worse results compared to no unwrapping.  They also raised the issue of scaling complex numbers before taking the logarithm.\n\nPhD C's qualifying exam preparation focused on \"cheating\" experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of intermediate categories in speech recognition.  They planned to use TIMIT and manipulate LNA files, setting probabilities of non-voicing phones to zero.  They also intended to extend the experiments to digits and explore inter-phoneme events. The professor preferred the quals to continue to include distant speech information.\n",
    "The meeting discussions centered on refining a speech recognition system, particularly for noisy environments.  One key area was the integration of multiple feature streams, including a novel approach using tandem neural networks.  The researchers discussed the advantages of combining standard features like PLP with neural network outputs, aiming to capture complementary information.  While this approach showed promise in some conditions, it sometimes led to increased deletion errors, especially in highly mismatched noise conditions.  The team explored various strategies to mitigate this, including adjusting the weighting of different feature streams within the recognizer, refining the neural network architecture, and potentially incorporating a VAD (Voice Activity Detector) flag as an additional input feature.\n\nAnother significant discussion point was the use of Noisy-ORs within the VAD. While not explicitly mentioned as \"Noisy-ORs,\" the concept was implicit in discussions about combining multiple VAD decisions based on different frequency bands or features. This approach aimed to improve VAD robustness by allowing any single band or feature to trigger a \"speech present\" decision.  Furthermore, the participants considered alternative VAD implementations based on signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and energy ratios before and after noise compensation, aiming to reduce latency.\n\nThe transcription formalization involved detailed documentation of the various feature extraction steps, neural network training configurations, and experimental results. This included specifics about the features used (PLP, MSG, MFCC), the neural network architecture (number of hidden units, context frames), the training data (TIMIT, SPINE, Macrophone), and the evaluation metrics (accuracy, deletion rates).  The team emphasized rigorous record-keeping of the numerous experiments conducted to understand the impact of different design choices and optimize system performance across various languages and noise conditions.\n",
    "Meeting participants discussed several options for improving data collection for Meeting Recorder.  They considered incorporating note-taking via CrossPads, a digital pen and paper system, but concerns arose regarding the system's infrastructure demands, including time synchronization and data format conversion.  The quality of handwriting recognition and the added burden on meeting participants were also cited as drawbacks.  An alternative suggestion involved using PDAs with wireless cards for note-taking, potentially simplifying the synchronization process.  However, this idea was not fully explored.  The group also debated the value of collecting meeting summaries.  Suggestions included asking participants to briefly summarize the meeting orally or identify the most interesting point learned.  These summaries could serve as a starting point for generating queries, although concerns were raised about potential bias and participant burden.  The professor emphasized the need to deploy a functional, even if rudimentary, system quickly to allow users to generate queries based on their actual needs.  He believed this approach would provide more valuable insights than theoretical discussions.  The professor also advocated for collecting visual data, such as photos of whiteboards and seating arrangements, to provide context, despite potential privacy concerns.  Regarding backups, the group discussed moving Meeting Recorder data to non-backed-up disks and implementing a separate manual backup system to reduce the load on the main backup system.  Finally, the inclusion of SmartKom data, a separate dialogue collection effort, in the Meeting Recorder corpus was debated.  While acknowledging potential benefits for acoustic studies, the professor argued against its inclusion due to the different nature of the data and potential confusion.  He suggested using the same tools and procedures for processing the SmartKom data but storing it separately.\n",
    "Discussions regarding HMRC primarily focused on the Welsh Government\u2019s decision to discontinue its partnership with HMRC for the childcare offer system.  Sian Gwenllian AM questioned the rationale behind this decision, highlighting the committee's prior understanding that HMRC could accommodate Welsh language standards.  Nicola Edwards explained that technical difficulties arose regarding the integration of Welsh language characters within HMRC's IT systems.  Specifically, the multiple IT systems involved, including those of the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, and the Post Office, presented challenges in ensuring compliance with Welsh language standards across the board.  However, Julie Morgan AM emphasized that the primary reason for the shift away from HMRC was the desire for greater flexibility in the childcare offer.  She stated that utilizing HMRC would have imposed limitations on expanding the offer, particularly concerning the inclusion of parents in education and training programs.  Jo-anne Daniels added that the costs presented by HMRC were significantly higher than initially estimated, and that working with local authorities would be more cost-effective while also keeping investment within Wales.  Local authorities, initially favoring HMRC due to the reduced administrative burden, were ultimately persuaded to support the change.  The Welsh Government intends to establish a permanent system with local authorities, with an estimated cost lower than that proposed by HMRC.  The committee expressed concern over the change in approach, given previous assurances regarding HMRC's suitability.\n",
    "The professor expressed interest in involving linguists in the project to contribute to dialogue and task design.  He suggested focusing on a belief net structure capable of handling the \"Vista, Enter, Tango\" distinctions for tourist destinations.  He also emphasized the importance of knowledge engineering to simplify the belief net's structure and avoid combinatorial explosion.  Regarding Grenada, the professor inquired about the proper payroll procedures for the individual assisting with subject organization and data collection, praising her performance in the role-playing experiment. The new form arrangement should use numbered bullets for clarity.  Grad A proposed a belief net structure based on image schemas (Trajector-Landmark, Source-Path-Goal), incorporating factors like intention, location properties, context, discourse elements, and world knowledge. Grad B questioned certain node definitions and expressed concern about the combinatorial explosion resulting from directly connecting numerous nodes to the mode selection.  Grad B did not offer a specific opinion on the proposed belief net structure, but participated in the discussion about its implementation and data collection.\n",
    "Grad E expressed concerns about the complexity of the project's data representation, specifically regarding the XML schema for action schemas and image schemas.  They requested more concrete examples to better understand the syntax and purpose of the schema, particularly how modules interact and the role of construal in interpreting user utterances. Grad E also emphasized the importance of considering spatial reference frames and their potential impact on language understanding, citing research on differences between English and German interpretations of spatial relations.\n\nGrad A, while acknowledging the validity of focusing on construal, cautioned against overgeneralizing its application. They highlighted the challenge of distinguishing between construal and pragmatics, particularly in examples like the \"bakery\" scenario where multiple interpretations are possible. Grad A suggested exploring metaphorical uses of spatial terms within the tourist domain and emphasized the need for a balance between theoretical rigor and practical applicability in the thesis proposal.  Furthermore, Grad A advocated for prioritizing computationally relevant examples for the target audience of computational linguists and other computer science professionals.\n",
    "The User Interface team prioritized a sleek, user-friendly design.  They advocated for a simple push-button interface with minimal buttons to avoid complexity, favoring a scroll wheel for channel selection and a clear LCD screen. They also suggested integrating teletext and subtitle functions into a single button. Recognizing the potential of voice control, they proposed including speech recognition, primarily as a remote-finding feature, acknowledging the existence of more sophisticated voice control technology in competing products. They also championed the idea of a kinetic power supply, eliminating the need for battery replacements. Regarding aesthetics, they leaned towards a single-curved, rubberized case for a modern look and spongy feel, suggesting the standby button could incorporate a trendy design element, like an apple shape, without compromising usability.  They also proposed a sticker for the company logo.  Ultimately, they favored a design that balances functionality, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness, keeping the design simple and avoiding features that might quickly become outdated.  The final decision, incorporating input from other teams, included a single-curved rubber case with simple push buttons, a scroll wheel, an LCD screen, a kinetic power supply, and voice recognition, using a simple circuit board to minimize costs. The apple-shaped standby button was adopted, and the company logo would be added as a sticker. Radio wave interference was discussed and dismissed as a concern due to the ability to select a frequency range without interference issues and the use of identification codes within the signal to prevent conflicts between remotes.  The extra budget was allocated to the LCD screen and scroll wheel, with voice recognition considered a low-cost addition.\n",
    "The professor views mean log magnitude spectral subtraction as a type of filter, specifically a high-pass or band-pass filter designed to remove low-frequency components.  They suggest that constraining the filter to only mean subtraction may limit its effectiveness compared to filters with more complex temporal and spectral behaviors.  The professor emphasizes the importance of considering the filter's startup behavior, especially in interactive systems like SmartKom, where utterances may be shorter than the training window.  They suggest a ramp-up approach where the mean is computed over progressively longer time windows, mimicking a filter's startup behavior.  Regarding Wiener filtering, the professor questions its efficacy when combined with online normalization and LDA, particularly given the system's existing performance without Wiener filtering. They note the importance of accurate noise estimation, suggesting the use of close-talking microphone data for this purpose.  The professor advocates exploring alternative noise compensation techniques like spectral subtraction and subspace methods, considering smoothing and VAD improvements to mitigate issues like musical noise.  They highlight the trade-off between latency and performance, advising a conservative approach to latency considerations.  Finally, the professor discusses using neural networks for noise suppression, acknowledging their potential but also the challenge of target selection and generalization across different noise types.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote control's function, focusing on user preferences and technical feasibility.  Marketing research revealed that users prioritize channel and volume control, find most remotes unattractive, and often lose them.  Therefore, the team explored simplifying the remote by focusing on essential functions, potentially using an LCD screen to access less-used features. They debated incorporating \"find me\" functionality, like a whistle-activated sound, to address the frequent misplacement issue.\n\nRegarding channel selection, the team acknowledged the increasing number of available channels and the user's desire to quickly navigate them.  They considered a slider or roller mechanism for scrolling through channels, possibly coupled with favorite channel presets.  However, using numbered buttons remained an option due to user familiarity and the ability to access any channel directly.  The kinetic function of a roller mechanism for channels and volume was a point of discussion, balancing ease of use with production costs.\n\nThe team also debated between infrared and radio waves for the remote's communication. While radio waves offered advantages like not needing line-of-sight, infrared was cheaper and the established standard.  Cost considerations were a recurring theme, influencing decisions about features like LCD screens and speech recognition. Though younger demographics favored advanced features, the team prioritized simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and broad user appeal.\n",
    "The team proposed a snowman-shaped remote control.  Initially, it was to have no LCD display, kinetic power and battery operation, rubber buttons with internal LED backlighting, and a jog dial. Due to cost constraints, the design shifted to a single-curved casing with a basic LCD screen, a scroll wheel, and a confirm button.  The advanced functions, initially planned as separate buttons, were accessed through the LCD screen and jog dial. The LCD panel would simply display the function name or related symbol (e.g., sun for brightness).  The team also decided to remove the rubber buttons and use standard plastic buttons to cut costs.  Further cost reductions were achieved by eliminating the LCD panel and using the television screen to display function selections, relying on an advanced chip. The final design included a single large button area with twelve functions, a single-colored case, two-colored buttons, and the company logo embossed on the side.  The dimensions were approximately 3 cm wide, 2 cm tall, and 3.5 cm deep.\n\nThe Industrial Design team aimed to create a fashionable and attractive product that would appeal to consumers visually, similar to the iPod.  They believed the design should be cool regardless of functionality.  Marketing agreed with the importance of visual appeal and user-friendliness, emphasizing the need for a design that draws consumers in.  They agreed that the remote should be simple to use, avoiding the complexity that requires extensive instruction manuals. Marketing expressed concerns about deviating too far from the standard button grid, fearing it might confuse consumers, but suggested exploring different button shapes.  They also proposed a product line with varying color schemes (e.g., harvest, vibrant).  Both teams were satisfied with the final design and agreed on the appearance for the design presentations.\n",
    "Grad G did not participate in these meetings. The professor expressed several opinions. He believed it was more important to determine how to handle different interpretations of \u201cwhere is X?\u201d than to determine the correct interpretation. He felt that using an ontology to make inferences from dialogue history was novel. He stated that local rules for a thesis could be determined by the student writing the thesis. He believed the professor should write the first cut of the revised formalism document. He felt that construal would need to be considered when drafting the constructions proposal. He thought it was important to note constructions that change the probabilities of EVA decisions. He felt that conditional probability within the Bayes net was equivalent to spreading activation and that intervening objects reset this probability. He suggested the term \"semspec\" and noted the semspec needed markings for emphasis and questions.  He supported Grad A's solution to simulating questions, calling it Skolemization. He suggested a paper titled \"Towards a formal cognitive semantics\" be written for linguists unfamiliar with the project. He felt the core group should be limited to 3 or 4 members. He wanted to make sure the project used insights from cognitive linguistics to create generalizable models. He suggested thinking about the decision variables, keeping nodes narrow to avoid combinatorics, and creating a compact decision node above the final one. He wanted the way properties were extracted to be generalizable across tasks and for deep semantic information to be pulled from constructions. He felt it was worthwhile to meet in the same room to allow for use of the display. He felt the subject Litonya did a good job in the experiment and took it seriously. He felt the tasks needed refinement and that linguists should contribute to the project.  He felt it wasn't necessary to prepare a big presentation for Wednesday's meeting. He wanted the belief net to be expanded out into more layers and for Grad A to merge the old and new belief nets. He felt Grad A should use \u201cintention\u201d as a node instead of \u201cintention business\u201d or \u201cintention tour.\u201d  He noted the values would be probabilities. The professor felt that Grad D could design code for a \"cognitive dispatcher\" module to find missing parts of complect object trees. He also felt there was a need for an intermediate representation that could be used across different inputs and outputs. He stated that deterministic rules could be used for gathering information but not for making final decisions. He did not oppose adding the \u201cwhat\u2019s this?\u201d domain. He suggested Grad D contact Lila about payroll information for Litonya. He felt Litonya was a better subject than expected. He also felt Litonya should take on organizing subjects. He approved of Grad D signing the group up for the Wednesday meeting slot. He suggested using the meetings to talk about system stuff with computer scientists and dialogue issues with linguists.\n\nThe professor did not express an opinion on capturing subject intention, MSG, or pronouncing zero. He did think Fey did a good job in the experiment and that she should",
    "The Industrial Designer stressed the importance of a simple and inexpensive design for the children's remote.  They suggested using an FPGA chip for functionality and infrared communication, initially dismissing Bluetooth due to cost concerns.  However, they acknowledged the potential of Bluetooth for PDA control and expressed interest in exploring its feasibility further.\n\nThe Industrial Designer prioritized selling their own remote control and questioned the necessity of advanced features like lighting adaptive options. They advocated for a user-friendly interface with minimal buttons, suggesting a screen-based navigation system on the TV.  They also proposed incorporating speech recognition, acknowledging the technical complexity but seeing its potential value.  The Industrial Designer emphasized the need to anticipate future technologies, like internet-enabled TVs, and design the remote control with adaptability in mind.  They also suggested the use of titanium and push buttons, citing manufacturing cost concerns with rubber and LCD screens respectively, although they remained open to exploring other materials and an LCD information display.  Finally, the Industrial Designer championed a trendy, \"fancy\" design, even suggesting fruit and vegetable shapes and colors, prioritizing aesthetics to appeal to younger demographics.\n",
    "Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders did not participate in these meetings, therefore there is no information on their views regarding inspections.  The meetings covered a wide range of topics but primarily focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact.  Discussions touched upon the economic fallout, government support programs for businesses and individuals, the reopening of the House of Commons, access to rural internet service, systemic racism within institutions like the RCMP, and the need for a fiscal update.  \n\nWhile there were discussions about systemic racism, particularly within law enforcement, and the allocation of government funds to address this issue, Justin Trudeau did not specifically elaborate on a governmental fund or his thoughts on a revolution in national institutions in these particular meetings.  The focus of the systemic racism discussion revolved around the need for police reform, particularly within the RCMP, the collection of race-based data, and addressing the over-policing and over-incarceration of Black and Indigenous people.  There was a call for a review of the RCMP budget to reallocate resources from policing towards community services.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote control's design from technical, functional, and user interface perspectives.  Technically, the internal components were detailed, including the energy source, integrated circuit, infrared transmitter, and potential for speech recognition.  The limitations of cost and current speech recognition technology were acknowledged.  Functionally, the remote was envisioned as a universal controller, capable of operating multiple devices like TVs, VCRs, and stereos.  The team explored the possibility of incorporating advanced features like an LCD screen and considered the trade-off between cost and market appeal.  User interface discussions focused on simplicity and ease of use, emphasizing a minimal number of strategically placed buttons.  The team also discussed user preferences for remote control aesthetics and the importance of a trendy design to attract younger consumers.  Concerns about existing remote control issues like lost remotes and complex button sequences were also raised, suggesting the need for innovative solutions.  The target demographic was identified as the 20-40 age group, who are presumed to have disposable income but may not be willing to pay high prices for a universal remote.\n",
    "The team discussed and evaluated the project's process, work division, and production plan in detail.  Initially, they aimed for a snowman-shaped remote with kinetic power, backlighting, and a jog dial. However, cost constraints led to revisions.  The LCD screen and advanced chip were removed, opting instead for on-screen TV feedback.  The team decided on a single-curved case with a rubber coating instead of a double-curved case with rubber buttons, reducing costs. The final design included a simplified button layout, a single color for the case, and the company logo.\n\nThe team expressed concerns about the limitations of the project\u2019s structure hindering creativity.  They felt restricted by budget constraints and the institutional meeting room environment. While they appreciated the provided structure, they believed a more relaxed and collaborative atmosphere would foster more creative input. The division of tasks and the restriction of communication to formal meetings were perceived as counterproductive to teamwork.\n\nThe team found the provided technology, such as digital pens and the projector, to be helpful but also a source of distraction.  They suggested that earlier prototyping and more whiteboard use would have facilitated better communication and brainstorming. The team also discussed the effectiveness of leadership, noting that while guidance was provided, the structured framework felt somewhat disempowering. They proposed that more freedom and delegation could enhance team ownership and creativity.  Overall, the team felt the project was productive, despite the constraints and limitations they encountered.\n",
    "PhD D did not present a multilingual model; rather, PhD C discussed a classification model for overlapping speech. PhD C proposed using a clustering algorithm or neural network to classify speech, overlapping speech, and silence.  He suggested using a variety of parameters such as MFCCs and PLP and proposed studying simple features like energy and harmonicity in two or three dimensions to gain insight into feature effectiveness.  The professor suggested focusing on fewer features initially and incorporating temporal properties using Markov models or time-based features.  They discussed using the LPC residual energy to identify multiple speakers and the potential of incorporating speaker location information derived from the two microphones in the PDA.  PhD C proposed starting with equalized, mixed speech to study spectral distortion and then moving to PDA files. Concerns about the low signal-to-noise ratio in PDA files were discussed.  PhD A questioned the effectiveness of beam-forming for overlap detection with PDAs, and the limitations of PDA microphone placement were acknowledged.  The discussion explored using cross-correlation of the two PDA microphones and using microphone arrays, but the professor reiterated the focus on impromptu discussions in non-instrumented environments.\n\nRegarding future directions, the group discussed collecting more data from diverse meeting types.  They explored the idea of using CrossPads for note-taking, capturing digital pictures of the meeting setup, and collecting oral summaries from participants.  Collecting queries based on participants' stated interests was discussed, along with concerns about introducing bias.  The desire for a system allowing meeting participants to query past meetings was emphasized.  The professor suggested using summaries as a starting point for query generation and proposed analyzing word frequencies within summaries to identify potential query topics.  The group also considered using indicator phrases like \"action item\" to guide query generation.  The importance of generating queries based on information deemed important at the time of the meeting, as well as information that becomes relevant later, was highlighted.  The potential for using oral meeting summaries as additional training data for speaker identification was also mentioned.\n\nFinally, the discussion about releasing meeting data focused on anonymizing speaker names and the implications for discourse analysis.  Concerns were raised about the feasibility of anonymizing names while maintaining the integrity of the audio and transcript for discourse research.  The idea of bleeping out names was suggested, but it was noted that this would complicate aligning the transcript with the audio.  The need for a consistent licensing policy for data release was emphasized.  The discussion also touched on the possibility of creating multiple versions of the released data with varying levels of anonymization.\n",
    "Ms. Jenny Kwan's concern, though not explicitly stated in these transcripts, likely centers around the disconnect between the development of programs like the Together for Children and Young People programme and their actual implementation on the ground.  Throughout the meeting, Ms. Shillabeer, the programme's chief executive, highlights several areas where this gap is evident.  While frameworks and guidance have been developed, consistent delivery is not guaranteed across Wales. For instance, despite the development of community intensive service teams and the specialist CAMHS framework, inconsistencies remain in crisis care and psychological therapies.  Furthermore, while the programme has facilitated workshops and planning groups for early help and enhanced support, the actual implementation of these strategies after the programme ends in October remains unclear. The lack of clarity regarding legacy arrangements, particularly the potential role of regional partnership boards, underscores this gap between planning and execution.  Ms. Kwan's likely point is that without clear lines of responsibility, adequate resources, and a commitment to consistent application, well-intentioned programs might not translate into tangible improvements in children and young people's mental health services.  The rapid increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, coupled with workforce challenges, further exemplifies this potential disconnect, as program development struggles to keep pace with the growing demand and the complex needs of the \"missing middle.\"\n",
    "The Project Manager seemed pleased with the final product design, highlighting the jog dial as a positive feature. They expressed satisfaction with the market research and design evaluation process, aiming for a balance between creativity and cost-effectiveness. The Project Manager believed the team successfully incorporated market trends and user preferences, achieving a score of about 70% against the project goals.\n\nHowever, the group felt the project's structure hindered creativity.  They believed the emphasis on individual work, separated by formal meetings in a sterile environment, limited their ability to brainstorm and collaborate effectively.  While they appreciated the project manager's leadership, they perceived it as overly structured and controlling, limiting their ownership and freedom. They also felt the reliance on PowerPoint presentations and individual note-taking hampered collaborative idea generation, suggesting a shared whiteboard or early prototyping might have been more beneficial.  They found the digital pens clunky and the abundance of computers distracting.\n\nThe group discussed drawing a panther, appreciating its powerful and stealthy qualities. The marketing expert initially suggested it but expressed uncertainty about its feasibility. The industrial designer questioned the difficulty of drawing a panther, while the user interface designer humorously suggested it might appear happy if depicted having just eaten.  Ultimately, the panther was not chosen as the subject of the drawing exercise.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote control's features and their relation to key concepts.  A major focus was the balance between functionality and simplicity.  The team acknowledged the importance of core functions like channel and volume control, prioritizing their ease of access and use.  There was a strong preference for minimizing the number of buttons, driven by user research indicating that most users utilize only a small percentage of buttons on typical remotes.  An LCD screen, possibly touch-sensitive, was considered crucial for consolidating functions and providing a modern interface. This approach aimed to address user frustrations with complex remotes and the difficulty of learning new ones.  The inclusion of a microphone for speech recognition was debated, with younger demographics showing high interest but concerns arising about cost and implementation complexity.  A docking station was proposed to address the common issue of losing the remote and to provide convenient recharging.  The team also explored the possibility of incorporating a help function on the LCD screen to aid users in understanding the remote's functionality.  Overall, the team sought to create a remote that was both user-friendly and technologically advanced, catering to a younger target market while remaining accessible to older users.\n",
    "The Canadian tourism sector, a significant economic driver, particularly in rural communities, faced unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Border closures, travel restrictions, and lockdowns across the country led to massive layoffs, business closures, and the potential loss of entire tourism seasons for many businesses. Seasonal businesses, heavily reliant on specific timeframes for revenue generation, were particularly vulnerable due to ineligibility for government aid programs designed for traditional business models. Tourism-dependent communities experienced unemployment rates as high as 85%.\n\nThe government acknowledged the devastating impact on the tourism industry and promised targeted support.  Initial measures included general business support programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), and the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA). However, many tourism businesses, especially small and seasonal enterprises, struggled to access these programs due to eligibility criteria related to payroll thresholds, business accounts, and revenue decline calculations.  The government pledged flexibility and adjustments to address these gaps, including increasing funding for regional development agencies to support local tourism initiatives. While the government acknowledged the need for a sector-specific aid package for tourism, the details and implementation of such a plan remained delayed, causing anxiety within the industry.  The government also emphasized collaboration with provinces and territories to coordinate reopening strategies and address the unique challenges faced by tourism-based economies.  However, concerns persisted regarding the lack of clarity on border reopening criteria and the long-term recovery plan for the tourism sector.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote\u2019s design, energy source, components, functionality, and prototype. Market research showed that a fancy look and feel was the highest priority, followed by technological innovation and ease of use.  A fruit or vegetable motif, spongy materials, and bright colors were trending. The team explored various shapes (flat, single curved, double curved) and materials (plastic, rubber, wood, titanium) for the casing.  Due to the spongy material requirement, rubber was chosen, limiting energy options.  Solar cells were ruled out due to incompatibility with a rubber casing. Kinetic energy was considered but ultimately rejected due to practicality concerns, leaving batteries as the primary power source.\n\nFor components, the team decided on an advanced chip to support an LCD screen and a spinning wheel for navigation. Push-buttons were included for essential functions like channel numbers and volume, with the remaining controls accessible via the LCD menu. Voice recognition was also incorporated.  The final design was a rubber, banana-shaped remote with a minimalist exterior. The LCD screen and spinning wheel were revealed by peeling back the spongy outer layer, mimicking a banana peel. The team decided to use company colors for the buttons and vegetable colors for the remote's main body. A prototype was to be created using modeling clay.\n",
    "The group discussed the upcoming DARPA meeting and the annual report. For the report, status reports and papers were reviewed. Additional clarification will be sought from individuals as needed.  Regarding the contents of the paper being prepared for the meeting, the discussion centered on the analysis of meeting transcripts and the use of prosodic and word-based features for tasks such as predicting interruptions.  The close-talking microphones were noted to provide better pitch tracks compared to Switchboard data, which had issues with halvings, doublings, and dropouts.  The paper will include preliminary results suggesting the effectiveness of certain features. The statistics included 62 hours of collected meeting data. The total amount transcribed was not available. Further, there was a discussion of the word error rate in digit recognition, which was described as trimodal. One mode corresponded to native speakers with near-zero error rates, another to non-native speakers with moderate error rates, and a third to \"pathological\" cases with very high error rates, possibly due to recording issues. Excluding these extremes, the average error rate was around 1.4%.",
    "The group agreed that the multi-English (TIMIT) trained network performed best on the TI-digits corpus, but the hand-labeled nature of TIMIT compared to the Viterbi-aligned other corpora made it difficult to isolate the benefit of language matching from the benefit of accurate labels.  Viterbi alignment itself wasn't considered a major problem, but the single pronunciation model used for alignment was a potential issue.  Noise dependency was also raised as a concern but not fully explored due to similar noise conditions across training sets.  They found that combining multiple features, especially MSG, didn't improve accuracy, possibly due to a bug related to pre-emphasis filtering or DC offset in the Italian data.  For current progress, they trained 79 MLPs on ten databases, with varying features, hidden layer sizes, and targets, but only 286 distinct tests had been run. They noted progress in online normalization significantly improved accuracy, often matching or exceeding the gains from using neural networks.  Delays were attributed to the large number of experiments being conducted and the complexity of integrating their work with the OGI system.  A key next step was testing the most successful configurations across all test sets, not just Italian, and exploring different methods for combining features, including adjusting stream variances.  Future work involved connecting their system to OGI's, addressing language and noise dependency by exploring alternative training targets (articulatory, soft, regression-based), and using multi-band training on noisy data.  They also discussed resource constraints, specifically disk space, and planned to transition to non-backed-up disks with a one-time backup to tape.\n",
    "\"Triple R\" was favored over \"Triple RC\" because it conveyed the impression of three remote controls, aligning better with the product's customizable cover concept.  \"Triple RC\" sounded like a single remote.\n\nThe target age group was set at 15\u201335. This decision stemmed from market research indicating a higher likelihood of younger demographics paying more for features like voice recognition, coupled with their relatively larger disposable income compared to older groups burdened with more financial commitments.  While the 25-35 age group was acknowledged as having more purchasing power, the enthusiasm and disposable income of the 15-25 group, particularly university students, were key factors.  The team also anticipated attracting older individuals (35+) who desired a trendy product.  The marketing team's focus on young people stemmed from this research and the aim to align with the company's image of fashionable electronics.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection revolved around the possibility of using voice recognition to select channels by name (e.g., \"ITV one\") rather than by number.  This was seen as a potential differentiator.  However, concerns were raised about the practicality of this feature, given the prevalence of channel names in TV advertising, which could trigger unintended channel changes. The team also discussed the inclusion of a \"beeper\" function to locate a lost remote, potentially activated by a button on the TV or a separate device included in the packaging.\n",
    "Market research revealed that 75% of remote control users \u201czap\u201d frequently, while 50% use only 10% of the remote\u2019s buttons.  Additionally, 50% reported frequently losing the remote.  34% stated that remotes take too long to learn.  Regarding desired features, 90% of the 15-25 age demographic and 76% of the 25-35 demographic expressed willingness to pay more for speech recognition. Interest in an LCD screen was also noted, though the research lacked specific data.\n\nDesign discussions focused on balancing functionality with cost, considering the target price of 12.50 Euros.  The group debated the necessity of numerous buttons, considering speech recognition as an alternative.  Inspiration from mobile phone design, particularly larger buttons, was suggested.  A universal remote concept arose, aiming to control multiple devices (TV, VCR, stereo) within the given price range.  The incorporation of an LCD screen for enhanced functionality and a rechargeable battery were discussed as potential selling points but with cost implications.\n\nThe group explored the need for a revolution in remote control interaction.  Existing designs were deemed \u201cawful,\u201d and the team aimed to create a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing product.  Streamlining features was a priority, exemplified by the suggestion of combining the power and enter functions.  A docking station was proposed to address the issue of lost remotes and enhance the design.\n\nFinally, the necessity of such a revolution was questioned, given that most televisions come with remotes.  The team discussed whether to target younger demographics or the larger 40+ market, who may be less technologically inclined.  The inclusion of teletext was debated, given its declining relevance in the face of the internet.  The team ultimately agreed to research the needs and preferences of the elderly, potentially creating a specialized product for that market.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM outlined her plan for quality assurance, emphasizing co-construction with the profession.  Quality improvement practitioners will conduct workshops to refine the curriculum based on feedback, followed by an editorial process in both English and Welsh, aiming for publication in January 2020.  She highlighted the shift from pioneer schools to a smaller group of innovative schools and subject experts for refining the curriculum framework.  Williams AM addressed concerns about balancing autonomy with national expectations by proposing legislation for \"what matters\" statements and a statutory framework for progression in each Area of Learning and Experience (AoLE).  This ensures a consistent national approach while allowing flexibility in teaching methods.  She confirmed mental health and well-being is included within the health and well-being AoLE and will be a statutory requirement for schools.  Responding to concerns about the sufficiency of their actions, Williams AM stressed their commitment to listening to partners and addressing concerns about certainty and a national approach. She highlighted the significant \u00a324 million investment in professional learning, the largest since devolution, empowering schools to address specific needs.  The selection of 16 innovation schools, representing diverse sectors and linguistic backgrounds, focuses on practical implementation and sharing best practices within clusters, supported by regional consortia.\n\nBethan Owen's comment on the high-risk category was not mentioned in the provided transcripts.\n\nThe five principles explained by Kirsty Williams AM were not explicitly stated as a distinct set within the provided text. However, key themes throughout her discussions included: co-construction with the profession, a purpose-led curriculum, autonomy and agency for teachers, a focus on equity and closing the attainment gap, and a commitment to ongoing professional learning.\n\nNew examinations and school qualifications will align with the curriculum, with Qualifications Wales leading a national conversation on qualification reform starting in November.  The Minister stressed qualifications should arise from the curriculum, not dictate it.\n\nWilliams AM responded to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions by highlighting the extensive engagement with stakeholders, including teachers, young people, and businesses. She emphasized the commitment to ongoing refinement and improvement, using feedback to inform decisions and ensure the curriculum is fit for purpose.  The Minister also pointed to the substantial financial investment in professional learning and the collaborative approach with regional consortia and innovation schools as evidence of their commitment to successful implementation.\n",
    "The team expressed satisfaction with the final product's appearance and technological features, particularly the voice recognition and jog dial.  They were pleased with the spongy feel of the prototype, achieved with a rubber coating.  The team also liked the interchangeable faceplate concept. However, they were disappointed about having to abandon the solar cell feature due to budget constraints. They felt restricted by the initial brief, which limited them to a TV remote concept, and by the tight budget.  While they appreciated having pre-prepared PowerPoint slides and digital pens, they felt these tools, along with the meeting room setup, hindered creative collaboration. They would have preferred a more flexible, iterative design process with increased opportunities for informal communication and brainstorming.  The team found the Play-Doh models helpful for conceptualizing and exploring ideas in a tactile way.  They suggested that earlier prototyping and more use of the whiteboard would have facilitated better teamwork and idea generation.  The digital pens, while novel, were considered clunky, and the abundance of laptops was seen as a distraction.  Overall, the team felt the structured nature of the project, while efficient, limited their creative freedom and collaborative potential.\n",
    "The SRI system uses channel adaptation, specifically mean subtraction, which is a form of channel normalization.  One participant, Dave, observed that mean subtraction makes PZM signals louder after re-synthesis, questioning if this gain control explains improved Aurora baseline system performance. Another participant, Morgan, countered that simply increasing signal amplitude wouldn't impact performance, suggesting improved signal-to-noise ratio as the reason.  Further discussion explored whether normalization issues or signal spikes from table hits, combined with mean normalization, could improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The participants also discussed using mean subtraction with a long-term mean calculation (12 seconds) and explored the performance drop with shorter time windows.  They questioned the benefit of training with 12 seconds if testing uses shorter windows, given that normal speech rarely reaches 12 seconds.  The concept of caching utterances for ongoing adaptation was raised, along with the idea of a second pass with a longer time window after an initial pass with a shorter window or no mean subtraction. This second pass could refine results based on the full utterance.\n",
    "The meeting participants discussed several technical issues. One discussion centered on the ideal filtering exponent difference in spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering for noise suppression. Different approaches, including operations on mel bands or FFT bins, and adjustments for over-subtraction, were considered.  The team decided to unify their noise suppression software and choose a single set of parameters to move forward with.  Another discussion focused on the Voice Activity Detector (VAD). The current VAD\u2019s performance, achieving a 20% improvement over the baseline by using probabilities from clean signals on far-field utterances, was deemed better than an alternative that achieved only a 14% improvement. Latency, currently 40ms plus 10ms for rank ordering, was also discussed, along with potential improvements through training on more data and adding features like RASTA.  The team considered integrating a neural network, debating whether it should operate on original or spectrally subtracted/Wiener filtered output, and whether it should be server-side or terminal-side.  They also discussed the amount of latency acceptable for the neural network, noting that some standards suggested 130ms while others allowed 250ms.  Frame dropping by the VAD was also a topic. One suggestion was to send all frames, marking those to be dropped, as sufficient bandwidth was available. Currently, an additional bit flags speech/non-speech, with frames dropped after delta computation.  Noise estimation methods were evaluated, but a compromise between relying on the first 15 frames and pauses was still needed.  The postdoc\u2019s new headphones were deemed too large for one participant\u2019s head, affecting acoustic quality. Finally, the deadline for one project was next week, coinciding with Hynek\u2019s return. This deadline was set to finalize a research path before Hynek\u2019s subsequent trip to Europe.\n",
    "Special schools are not specifically addressed in the meeting transcripts regarding their role in the new purpose arrangement. However, the transcripts do mention special schools in relation to their generally high performance and the observation that those serving children with emotional and behavioral difficulties face greater challenges.  \n\nLooked-after children (LAC) are discussed extensively. The Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for LAC is now allocated to regional consortia rather than directly to schools. This shift aims to provide a more strategic approach and prevent funding from being lost when a LAC changes schools. The consortia use the PDG for LAC in various ways, including training on attachment disorder, school-to-school best practice sharing, and individual bursaries.  Regional consortia also employ LAC coordinators.  There are concerns about the lack of awareness of this PDG among schools and the need for greater scrutiny of its use and impact.  The Welsh Government has commissioned an external evaluation of the PDG for LAC, and there are ongoing discussions about creating a dataset to track adopted children and ensure appropriate support.  It was noted that special schools and PRUs face unique challenges and require dedicated support and resources.  It was also noted that there is a lack of sensitivity in some schools towards adopted children and a need for more training and awareness in this area.\n",
    "The prototype was not formally introduced in these meetings.  The team discussed the functions and design of a new remote control, including market research showing user interest in features such as a way to locate a lost remote and speech recognition.  The idea of a universal remote was discussed at length.  The price point of 12.50 Euros was a limiting factor for including higher-end features like an LCD screen, but the team explored the possibility of creating a universal-type remote with a lower price point than competitors by supporting a limited number of devices (e.g., TV, VCR, and stereo).  The younger demographic (15-25 years) expressed a high level of interest in paying more for speech recognition, and the team considered incorporating elements from mobile phone design to appeal to this group.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer made several comments on the appearance and structure of the remote. They discussed the placement of the slogan, suggesting it could be placed on the side or bottom. They also estimated the size of the remote and buttons based on the user's hand size, proposing button dimensions of approximately one centimeter. The Industrial Designer questioned the width of the remote and confirmed the height. They also suggested simplifying the LCD panel to display basic functions with symbols or pictures.  Later, the Industrial Designer advocated for changing the button shape rather than the positioning, believing customers were accustomed to traditional layouts. They expressed concern about unfamiliar designs impacting shelf appeal. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of the remote's tactile feel and suggested a more ergonomic shape molded to the hand. They confirmed the placement of the power button, infrared section, and cover.  They also proposed widening the base of the remote for better stability and adding another logo. They championed the remote's unique look and how it met the criteria for being different. Finally, the Industrial Designer explored alternative sales channels like internet promotion and ordering for customization and discussed the importance of user testing and timing the product launch.\n",
    "The provided transcripts do not contain information regarding the allocation of $75 million toward addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking.  There is no mention of a \"solution to risk appetite.\"\n\nWhile the transcripts extensively discuss racism, they do not explicitly convey Hon. Chrystia Freeland's perspective on systemic racism.  However, she emphasizes the importance of addressing the situation in long-term care homes, disproportionately impacting racialized communities, and highlights government investments in fighting anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, and unconscious bias.  She mentions the UN's International Decade for People of African Descent, applications for capacity building in Black Canadian communities, the anti-racism secretariat, and an immunity task force providing disaggregated data.  Other members speak about the need for race-based data collection and the impacts of systemic racism on various communities.\n",
    "Thilo's segmenter is working very well.  It has high recall, even if the precision is low due to over-generation. This is viewed as beneficial for training noise models in the recognizer. The developers plan to move to performing recognition on automatic segmentations provided by the segmenter.  Previously, hand-segmentations were used, which was considered \"cheating.\" There are plans to retrain or adapt the models for background noise to the meeting environment and to make use of Thilo's posteriors.  There was a discussion regarding the need for more hand-labeled data to have a ground truth for segmentation work, as the current pre-segmentations, while helpful, sometimes need adjustments, particularly for short utterances.  Overall, the segmenter is viewed as a significant time saver and a major step forward for the project.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) and Industrial designers disagreed on price due to the inclusion of interchangeable casings. While the UI designer believed this catered to user preferences for aesthetic variety (like different fruit and vegetable themes) and aligned with trends, the Industrial designer was concerned about the added cost. The disagreement on the redesign stemmed from the UI designer's focus on aesthetics and trends, favoring a fruit/vegetable-inspired look, while the Industrial designer prioritized practicality and cost-effectiveness, leading to a simpler, flatter design.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red because they were readily available for the prototype and could be incorporated into the \"banana\" (yellow and black) and \"watermelon\" (red and green) color schemes.  They later acknowledged these colors weren't ideal and envisioned a more sophisticated palette for the final product.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the UI designer's fruit-shaped product because they felt limiting the design to only a few fruit options would restrict consumer choice. They argued that offering a wider variety of shapes, as seen in other product categories like candy, would be more appealing to a broader market.  They believed most electronics companies offered several design options, even if they shared a common style or branding.\n",
    "Dafydd Evans, Kay Martin, and Nick Brazil all express serious reservations about the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment.  Evans states outright that employers lack a clear understanding of the qualification, finding even its name unhelpful. He suggests the \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" is a more transparent title.  Brazil supports this, noting that in his interactions with employer boards, the Welsh bac is rarely, if ever, mentioned as a desired qualification. Employers, he says, prioritize professional qualifications and demonstrable skills over the Welsh bac.  Martin concurs, pointing out that employers primarily seek core qualifications relevant to specific industries, along with essential literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.  She highlights other programs, like Career Ready, that more effectively engage employers and provide valuable work experience.\n\nWhile all three acknowledge the initial vision of the Welsh bac as promising, they agree that it has become overly focused on outcomes and bureaucratic processes rather than skills development.  They question its value, especially given the existence of alternative, more successful programs.  Brazil raises the crucial point that funding mechanisms incentivize pursuing the Welsh bac despite its shortcomings.  He and Martin suggest that its rigorous demands place undue pressure on learners, particularly those also resitting GCSEs, and that it may not be the most effective use of their time.  Brazil questions the necessity of the Welsh bac when other programs address employability skills more effectively.  Ultimately, they all see a need to review and potentially restructure the qualification to better serve its intended purpose.\n",
    "The team explored additional functions and design ideas for the remote.  A key area of focus was speech recognition, driven by market research indicating strong consumer interest, particularly within the 15-35 age demographic.  Concerns were raised about the technology's cost, reliability, and potential for misinterpretation of ambient sounds.  The team also debated the necessity of an LCD screen, ultimately deciding against it to reduce costs, opting instead to rely on the television's display for feedback.  They discussed incorporating advanced features, like audio and display settings, potentially hidden or accessible via a menu.  A suggestion to categorize controls into three groups\u2014audio, visual, and device\u2014gained traction for simplifying user experience and design.  The team also emphasized the importance of aesthetics, aiming for a sleek, fashionable design in line with the company's image, while also prioritizing ease of use and maintaining a reasonable price point.  They briefly touched upon the power source, leaning towards standard batteries for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, unless high power consumption became a factor.\n",
    "The project manager, Sarah, aimed for a trendy, user-friendly remote control appealing to a broad demographic, from children to the elderly.  A key concern was balancing functionality with cost, given the target selling price of 25 Euros and a production cost cap of 12.50 Euros.  They questioned whether this price point represented a premium or mid-range product, especially considering international market variations.  \n\nSarah saw the potential for a unique selling point, acknowledging the need for the remote to be perceived as valuable despite its basic functionality.  They favored including teletext, even if becoming outdated, unless it significantly impacted cost.  Open to innovative features like voice activation or a power cradle, Sarah emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness.  They also stressed the remote's compatibility with multiple TV brands.  Ultimately, Sarah considered prioritizing design and durability over complex features, potentially lowering the profit margin to achieve a competitive price point and build brand recognition for Real Reaction.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) expressed several concerns regarding cost constraints and other practicalities of the remote control project.  Initially enthusiastic about innovative materials like titanium and unusual designs like spongy fruit and vegetable shapes, UI acknowledged the impracticality of these ideas due to cost and manufacturing limitations.  They favored incorporating the company's colors (yellow and black) and suggested a chunky, plastic design with a simple interface.\n\nUI was particularly interested in minimizing the number of buttons while maximizing functionality.  They proposed using a scroll wheel similar to an iPod and displaying menus and options on the television screen rather than on the remote itself.  This approach, they argued, would be cost-effective and user-friendly.  They also stressed the importance of clear, unambiguous button design to avoid user confusion.\n\nRegarding the energy source, UI supported the kinetic battery option, citing its potential for a lighter, more convenient remote. However, they also recognized the dependence on cost and development time.  Finally, UI advocated for a durable, high-quality feel for the remote, even if it meant using less expensive materials like plastic, emphasizing the importance of perceived value to the consumer.\n",
    "The disagreements stemmed from differing priorities and interpretations of market research. Marketing emphasized the \"fancy look and feel\" identified in the research, prioritizing aesthetics and innovation over pure functionality. This led them to suggest features like a light-up design, vibrant colors, and soft, spongy materials, drawing inspiration from emerging fruit and vegetable trends in fashion. They also championed a jog dial for channel and volume control, prioritizing a modern, sleek aesthetic.  They expressed concern that the Industrial Designer's initial proposals felt too similar to existing remotes, pushing for more high-tech features to distinguish the product.\n\nThe Industrial Designer, however, prioritized simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and technical feasibility.  They cautioned against overly complex features, highlighting the potential cost increase associated with an LCD screen and a more sophisticated chip required for the jog dial.  They also raised concerns about the practicality of kinetic energy, citing potential user inconvenience and the need for a battery backup.  While acknowledging the market research regarding soft, spongy materials, the Industrial Designer pointed out technical constraints related to incorporating such materials with certain power sources and internal components.  The titanium casing, initially favored by the Industrial Designer for its durability, was ultimately deemed too expensive and limiting in terms of design flexibility.  This difference in approach\u2014Marketing's focus on aesthetics and innovation versus the Industrial Designer's focus on practicality and cost\u2014led to disagreements about the best way to incorporate market trends and technological advancements into the final product.\n",
    "Discussions regarding HEFCW's powers of intervention focused on their effectiveness and flexibility. HEFCW described the powers as \"threatening,\" \"inflexible,\" and \"difficult to use,\" particularly for swift interventions.  They expressed a preference for informal measures, facilitated by the small size of the higher education sector in Wales.  Concerns were raised about the limited range of interventions, perceived as a stark jump from informal measures to severe sanctions.  The Minister acknowledged the feedback and expressed a desire for the new commission to have a graduated series of interventions, ranging from advice and guidance to more punitive measures.  The Minister also highlighted the importance of the commission building strong relationships with the sector, mirroring the current dynamic between HEFCW and institutions.  The effectiveness of fee and access plans was also questioned, with concerns about their bureaucratic nature and focus on inputs rather than outcomes.  The Minister indicated a preference for moving towards longer-term, outcome-focused agreements.  Regarding closure decisions, universities in Wales operate autonomously.  While the Welsh Government maintains contact with the sector and encourages collaboration, the ultimate decision to close rests with individual institutions.  The Minister confirmed ongoing dialogue with stakeholders like Universities Wales to address concerns and refine approaches.  The emergency legislation introduced due to the pandemic grants the government additional powers to temporarily close or direct the operation of educational institutions, but the specifics of how these powers might be used were not detailed in these transcripts.\n",
    "The team plans to market their remote internationally, aiming for a \u20ac50 million profit.  Their initial strategy involved setting a retail price of \u20ac25 with a \u20ac12.50 profit margin per unit, requiring them to sell 4 million units.  However, the inclusion of an LCD screen (\u20ac2-\u20ac3) brings the production cost closer to the original \u20ac12.50 budget. To achieve their profit goal, they discuss raising the price to \u20ac50, acknowledging the need to factor in transportation, promotion, and labor costs, which are currently excluded from the production cost.  They also debate the feasibility of capturing 25% of the estimated 8-9 million unit market. To potentially increase sales and reduce per-unit costs, they propose an online sales and customization model, allowing customers to personalize the remote's appearance.  This approach eliminates storage costs and offers greater flexibility.  Additionally, they suggest synchronizing the product launch with a major event like the World Cup and partnering with companies like Sony Pictures for targeted campaigns.  This would allow for additional user testing and potentially boost sales beyond the initial 2 million unit target.\n",
    "Discussions regarding policies for free-school-meal children during the pandemic included a focus on food provision, physical education, and measures to support vulnerable children.  The Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, emphasized the government's commitment to ensuring no child missed out on education or free school meals, even during school closures.  Initial plans focused on emergency responses, with schools and local authorities working rapidly to provide meals and safe spaces for children of key workers and vulnerable children. Longer-term strategies aimed to create a seamless system of free-school-meal provision, even during holiday periods, to address the ongoing needs of families.\n\nFor vulnerable children, including those on the at-risk register, those with additional learning needs, young carers, and children potentially witnessing domestic abuse, plans included discretion for teachers and headteachers to identify and include children needing support.  Local authorities worked with social services and schools to identify these children and ensure their safeguarding needs were met.  Special schools remained open for vulnerable children and children of key workers, with risk assessments conducted to determine appropriate support.\n\nPhysical education and other activities were incorporated into the plans for children attending school hubs.  These activities aimed to provide a planned and worthwhile experience for children while their parents performed essential work.  The government also addressed concerns about the mental health and well-being of children during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of routine, communication, and access to online support services like the Meic website.  Funding was allocated to local authorities to enhance counseling and therapeutic services for children and families.  Additionally, the government explored ways to provide technology and internet access to digitally excluded learners to ensure continuity of learning.  The discussion also included how to best communicate expectations to parents regarding home learning.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) considered a curved design for the remote control keypad and an ergonomic overall design to achieve a \"sleek and sexy\" look, influenced by trends in mobile phone design. The team also favored rubberized materials for both the casing and buttons to achieve a \"spongy feel\" which was on-trend.  They agreed on \"easy to use,\" \"fashion,\" \"easy to find,\" and \"robust\" as key features based on market research indicating consumer frustration with complex, easily lost remotes, and a desire for visually appealing electronics.  \"Easy to use\" was further supported by the finding that users only utilized a small percentage of available buttons.  The \"easy to find\" feature stemmed from the frequent problem of lost remotes.  \"Robust\" was not explicitly discussed but implied through material and design choices aimed at durability.\n\nUI evaluated the remote's fashion primarily through trend-watching reports, which initially suggested fruit and vegetable themes. However, the team deemed this impractical for button design and opted for a more subtle approach to incorporating trends, focusing on shape, material, and color. They discussed the possibility of interchangeable cases in various colors to follow evolving fashion trends without requiring a complete redesign of the remote's core components.  The company's color scheme and logo were also to be integrated into the design.\n"
