    " Mean subtraction in SRI experiments involves the process of removing the mean log magnitude spectral subtraction, which is a technique used to improve the quality of the noisy speech signal. This process aims to eliminate the noise and enhance the speech signal by subtracting the mean log magnitude spectrum of the noisy speech from its original spectrum. However, there are some challenges associated with this technique, such as the difficulty in estimating the noise and the impact of the noise estimation on the overall performance of the speech recognition system. To address these challenges, researchers have explored alternative approaches, including the use of Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction. Wiener filtering is a technique that involves estimating the noise and then subtracting it from the noisy speech signal to produce a cleaner signal. Spectral subtraction, on the other hand, involves subtracting the estimated noise from the noisy speech signal, but with some modifications to avoid producing negative values. Another approach is the use of Vector Taylor Series (VTS), which is a mathematical technique used to represent the noisy speech signal as a sum of clean and noise components. By representing the noisy speech signal in this way, researchers can estimate the noise and clean speech components separately, allowing for improved noise reduction and speech recognition performance.
