    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design of the new remote control to enhance user comfort and appeal. The ergonomic design was aimed at making the remote control easy to hold and operate, aligning with the goal of creating a product that is \"easy to use.\" The curved design was also believed to contribute to a \"fashionable\" appearance, which was important given the emphasis on aesthetics in consumer electronics. The discussions highlighted the importance of creating a sleek and sexy look that would appeal to consumers and differentiate the product in the market.\n\nThe reasons for agreement on the \"easy to use,\" \"fashion,\" \"easy to find,\" and \"robust\" features were based on market research and user feedback. Simplifying the remote by reducing the number of buttons and focusing on essential functions was seen as a way to address user frustrations with complex remotes. The inclusion of a tracking device was suggested to address the common issue of remotes being lost, making it \"easy to find.\" The focus on a robust design was intended to ensure durability, an important feature for consumers.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by considering current trends and consumer preferences. The marketing team conducted research into fashion trends, noting that consumers were interested in products with modern, cool looks and unique designs. They discussed incorporating trendy elements, such as a spongy feel or unique button shapes, while balancing these with practicality to avoid complicating the user experience. The decision to potentially offer interchangeable cases was also discussed as a way to keep up with changing fashion trends without altering the core product design."
