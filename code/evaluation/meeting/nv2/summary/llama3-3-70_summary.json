    "Dr david blaney's opinion on the impact of brexit on wales ' higher education system\n\ndr. David blaney : \nwell , i think it 's fair to say that there are financial challenges facing our universities in wales . They result from three main causes : one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18 - year - olds , which is deeper and longer in wales than it is elsewhere in the uk . Another is the current uncertainty as a result of the augar review in england , and whether or not that might play into wales . \n\nThese challenges are not unique to wales ; the majority of the uk universities are actually taking out cost one way or another . Before the diamond review of fees and funding in wales , there was a pre - existing funding gap in resource between england and wales , and even now , that gap remains .\n\nUniversities have reserves , but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates , so they ' re not immediately realisable . The key measure that we look at is operating cash , which is about 7 .6 per cent of income , which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for english institutions for the same year .\n\nThere are differences in the way that universities have secured funding arrangements , but the governance oversight of those arrangements is structured to look at the liquidity ratios , and the repayment terms of borrowings , which can become an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have .\n\nWe have a role to play in this as well , by providing information to help governing bodies be properly informed , and by encouraging them to engage in continual refreshing of their governance arrangements .\n\nDr . David blaney believes that the welsh government will implement the diamond review proposals , and that the introduction of the diamond settlement is going to be really important . The minister has made a commitment to the sector to deliver the diamond settlement , and we expect all of the institutions to work together to deliver that settlement .\n\nBethan owen added that we also need to look at how we can be more transparent about the use of fee income , and that we need to work with",
