    "The mental spaces discussed in the meetings can be broadly categorized into domains such as time, space, and abstract concepts like hypothetical scenarios or metaphorical interpretations. These domains are interconnected and often overlap, allowing for complex linguistic expressions and interpretations. For example, time is frequently construed spatially, as in phrases like \"where was Heidelberg in the Thirty Years' War?\" which uses spatial language to discuss temporal events. Similarly, abstract concepts like \"trouble\" can be metaphorically construed as a container, as in \"I\u2019m in trouble,\" where \"trouble\" is treated as a bounded space.\n\nThe middle layer in this framework functions as a bridge between the abstract mental spaces and the concrete linguistic constructions. It facilitates the mapping of abstract concepts (e.g., metaphorical or metonymic interpretations) onto specific linguistic forms. This layer is crucial for construal, the process by which speakers and listeners dynamically interpret language based on context, ontology, and discourse models. For instance, the middle layer would handle how the phrase \"I\u2019m out of film\" is interpreted not just literally (as a lack of film) but also metaphorically (as a state of resource depletion). It ensures that linguistic constructions, such as prepositions or verbs, can be flexibly applied across different domains (e.g., \"in the bus\" vs. \"on the bus\") by adjusting the underlying construal mechanisms. This layer thus enables the system to handle both literal and metaphorical uses of language efficiently.",
