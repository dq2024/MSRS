    "Latency in systems is an important aspect of education, but it requires a balance between providing support for students who are underachieving and those who are more able and talented. The welsh government has introduced reforms to improve educational outcomes, but there is still room for improvement. Estyn inspections have shown that some schools are not using the pdg effectively, and there is a need for better evaluation of how the grant is being used. The pdg has been successful in improving attendance and reducing exclusion rates for some cohorts of students, but there is still a gap between the attainment of students eligible for free school meals and those who are not. The key stage 4 results indicate that there is still work to be done to close this gap. The latency and numeracy skills of teachers are crucial in helping students to make progress, but the curriculum and pedagogy also play a role in developing these skills. Community relationships and parental involvement are also important in helping students to make progress. The use of data and research findings can also help inform decision making in education, but there is a need for more evidence on how the pdg is being used and what its impact is. The welsh government should continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the pdg and make adjustments as needed. The development of new curriculum and assessments should also be monitored and evaluated to ensure that they are fit for purpose and are having the desired impact. The engagement of schools with regional consortia and other agencies can also help to identify best practice and share knowledge and experience. The development of leadership skills and the effective use of resources can also help to improve educational outcomes and reduce inequalities. The welsh government should continue to support schools in developing these skills and reducing inequalities, and should also continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the pdg and make adjustments as needed. The pdg can be used to target specific groups of students, such as looked-after children and adopted children, but it should be used in a way that is transparent and accountable. The w",

    "250-300 words \nin response to the question posed about the meetings:\nthe welsh government is taking several lessons from the schools challenge cymru program, a three-year investment in improving educational outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. While the program has shown some positive results, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of the program in narrowing the attainment gap. The government recognizes that more needs to be done to support disadvantaged pupils, particularly in terms of literacy and numeracy.\n\nOne lesson learned is the importance of targeting support effectively. The government acknowledges that some schools have been using the pupil development grant (pdg) more flexibly, with some schools using it to support pupils who are not eligible for free school meals. However , the government emphasizes that the pdg should be targeted at pupils who are eligible for free school meals .\n\nAnother lesson learned is the need for more effective use of data and evaluation . The government notes that while some schools have made good use of the pdg , others have not evaluated its effectiveness properly . The government emphasizes the need for schools to evaluate the impact of the pdg and to use data to inform their decisions .\n\nThe government also recognizes the importance of supporting more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals . The government notes that some schools have been using the pdg to support more able and talented pupils , but more needs to be done to ensure that these pupils receive adequate support .\n\nFurthermore , the government emphasizes the need for more effective partnerships between schools and communities organizations . The government notes that some schools have been successful in partnering with community organizations to support disadvantaged pupils , and that these partnerships should be replicated in other schools .\n\nOverall , the welsh government is committed to continuing to support disadvantaged pupils and to improving educational outcomes . The government recognizes that more needs to be done to address the attainment gap , but is committed to working with schools and community organizations to achieve this goal . \n\nIn response to the follow-up questions \nthe government is committed to continuing to support disadvantaged pupils and to improving educational outcomes .

    "1. The opinion of the group on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure\n\nthe group's opinion on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure is that it is a good starting point, but it has its limitations. While there is a strong correlation between children who are eligible for free school meals and those who are disadvantaged, it is not a perfect measure, and there are other factors that can influence a child's attainment and well-being.\n\n2 . Evaluating the impact of pdg on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals\n\nthe pdg has been used to improve attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, but there is still a gap in attendance and attainment between children receiving free school meals and those who are not. \nSome schools have used innovative approaches, such as employing staff to work with families and providing support for children who are absent from school. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and what works for one school may not work for another. Factors such as the quality of teaching, the curriculum, and the school's approach to supporting disadvantaged children can all impact on the effectiveness of the pdg.\n\n3 . Targeting the pdg more effectively\n\nthe pdg should be targeted more effectively at children who are eligible for free school meals, and schools should use a combination of approaches, including universal interventions and targeted interventions, to support these children .\n \nIndividual interventions should be targeted at children who are eligible for free school meals, but universal interventions, such as training all staff in growth mindset or attachment disorder, can also be beneficial for these children. Schools should demonstrate that universal interventions has a disproportionate effect on children eligible for free school meals.\n\n4 . Ensuring that schools have the appropriate systems in place to demonstrate the use of pdg\n\nschools should have systems in place to demonstrate the impact of the pdg on children receiving free school meals, including tracking progress, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and making data-driven decisions. This will help to ensure that the pdg is being used effectively and that schools are making a positive impact on the lives of disadvantaged children .\n\n5 .

The chief inspector of estyn, meilyr rowlands, stated that while there have been some small improvements overall, the attainment gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and those not eligible for free school meals remains significant. However, he also noted that the pdg has not been used effectively by all schools, with some schools still struggling to make effective use of the funding.\n\nThe main issues discussed were the effectiveness of the pdg in improving educational outcomes for students eligible for free school meals, the extent to which it should be spent, and the extent to which it is currently being spent. Meilyr rowlands stated that the pdg is most effectively used by schools that have good leadership, but even in these schools, the funding is not always used effectively. He also mentioned that the pdg is not just for students eligible for free school meals, but also for other disadvantaged groups such as looked-after children and adopted children.\n\nMeilyr rowlands also discussed the importance of community engagement in improving educational outcomes for students eligible for free school meals, stating that schools that do engage well with their communities and families tend to have better results. He also mentioned that the evaluation of the effectiveness of the pdg is difficult, as it depends on how the funding is used, and whether it is used effectively or not.\n\nOverall, the meeting provided an overview of the effectiveness of the pdg in improving educational outcomes for students eligible for free school meals, and identified areas for improvement, including",

    "The discussion on on-line and phase normalization, and the opinion of phd c and the professor on phase normalization and quals is as follows : \nphd c stated that they have been working on on-line normalization for a while now, trying different means for c-zero and other coefficients. They also tested training with two different means for silence and speech, but found that it did not help much. They attribute it to the fact that the mean for c-zero and c-one are more different than for other coefficients. They speculate that it may be because of noises in the background which cause different means for silence and speech.\n\nThe professor expressed interest in knowing why phase normalization does not work well and suggested that it might be due to problems with arithmetic. He also mentioned that there may be potential ways to deal with phase by working with complex numbers and then dividing them out or taking the log of the complex numbers. \n\nPhd g expressed that they have been experimenting with phase normalization, but it has not been successful so far. They plan to continue experimenting with it.\n\nGrad a mentioned that they plan to do some experiments to determine the effectiveness of different categories for speech recognition and plan to use those results to improve speech recognition.

    "The disagreements between marketing and the industrial designer arose due to differing opinions on future product ideas, specifically regarding the use of kinetic energy and the decision to make the product upgradable. The industrial designer proposed using kinetic energy, citing examples of modern watches that harness kinetic energy, but expressed doubts about its feasibility for a remote control that would often be stationary. In contrast, the marketing representative emphasized the importance of creating a product that is both stylish and functional, suggesting that the kinetic energy idea might not be practical. Additionally, the team discussed the pros and cons of making the product upgradable, with the industrial designer noting that while upgradability is desirable, it may not be feasible with certain materials, such as latex, which would prevent the use of solar cells as an energy source. Overall, the team aimed to strike a balance between innovation, aesthetics, and practicality in their design decisions.",
