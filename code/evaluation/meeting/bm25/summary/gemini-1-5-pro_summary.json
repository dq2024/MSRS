    "The group expressed a need for several changes regarding transcriptions.  First, they needed to improve the encoding and representation of overlapping speech.  The current interface limited the transcribers' ability to fully detail overlaps, lacking start and end points for each overlap.  They discussed the possibility of modifying the existing interface or adopting a new tool, with \u201cmusical score notation\u201d presented as an ideal format for representing multiple channels and a single timeline.  They also discussed using IBM\u2019s transcriptions as a first pass, potentially refining them through alignment or further analysis.  Second, they noted the need to enhance the connection between speaker names used in the dialogue and speaker identification tags.  This was particularly important for discourse analysis, where linking references to individuals with their subsequent utterances is essential. Simply replacing names with anonymized tags would hinder this type of research.  Finally, the professor suggested using the transcribers for more detailed analyses beyond phonetic transcription, such as a deeper examination of overlapping speech, given the current availability of funding for temporary staff.  He also recommended exploring additional features for identifying overlaps, such as pitch-related and harmonic-related features, given the challenges encountered with energy-based approaches.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of sleek, stylish, and sophisticated remotes for younger demographics, particularly those aged 15\u201335.  They considered voice recognition a key feature for this market, citing survey data showing high interest among younger users and their willingness to pay a premium for it.  This age group's higher disposable income, due to fewer financial commitments like mortgages or car payments, was also highlighted. The team believed that even a moderately priced remote around 25 Euros would be affordable for this demographic.  However, they acknowledged the need to balance advanced features with affordability and practicality, recognizing that not all users would embrace voice control.  The team also explored alternative input methods, like touch screens, but cost concerns led them to favor retaining traditional buttons alongside voice recognition. The inclusion of both features would position the remote as a premium product, justifying a higher price point and potentially attracting a wider market.\n",
    "Discussions regarding the Canadian economy's uncertainty and the government's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic were prevalent throughout the provided meeting transcripts.  Concerns were raised about the economic impact of the pandemic, the government's response programs (CERB, CEWS, CEBA, rent relief),  and the perceived inadequacy of support for various sectors like tourism, agriculture, and small businesses.  Specific issues included the rigidity of eligibility criteria for programs, the slow rollout of funds, the lack of a fiscal update, and the potential for fraud within the CERB program.  The impact of the carbon tax on farmers was also a recurring point of contention.\n\nCathy McLeod repeatedly questioned the government's economic policies, criticizing the lack of a fiscal update and the inadequacy of support for the forestry industry.  She expressed concern about the economic impact of the pandemic and the government's perceived lack of transparency.\n\nMona Fortier, responding on behalf of the government, emphasized the government's commitment to supporting Canadians and businesses through various programs. She defended the government's actions, highlighting the speed at which aid was distributed and the ongoing efforts to adapt and improve programs. She also stated that a full economic update would be provided when clear projections were possible.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie also pressed the government for a fiscal update, expressing concern that waiting for stability would be too late. He questioned the government's decision to seek private sector input for its recovery plan, suggesting that public servants and opposition parties could offer valuable insights.  He also emphasized the need for the government to be transparent about the costs of the pandemic and its economic recovery plan.\n",
    "The industrial designer considered the tiger's scary and strong characteristics worthy of studying for the product design.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the transcriber interface and alternative tools.  They found the French tool, Transcriber, to be generally useful with a nice Tcl-TK interface. Its ability to link utterances with the audio, identify speakers, and mark repairs was praised. However, the interface only allowed for two simultaneous speakers, which was problematic for meetings.  A team member wrote a script to overcome this limitation, converting a multi-speaker convention into Transcriber's format, allowing for editing after the fact.\n\nThe team also considered automatic speech recognition (ASR) software but acknowledged its low quality for meeting transcription.  The possibility of using ASR for initial time marking, followed by human correction, was proposed.  Commercial transcription services were deemed too expensive, especially given the multi-speaker nature of the meetings.  Linguistics students were considered a more cost-effective option.\n\nAdditional features and interface improvements for Transcriber were suggested, such as adjustable delays for marking boundaries, volume-based marker insertion, speaker identification, and analog input devices for faster navigation.  The team debated the value of investing time in developing such tools versus manual transcription efforts.  The use of pre-segmented audio was found to significantly reduce transcription time.  The format of the transcripts, particularly regarding speaker identification, overlapping speech, backchannels, and non-standard pronunciations, was discussed extensively, with the goal of balancing detail with transcription efficiency and ASR compatibility.  Finally, the team briefly discussed creating a website to organize and distribute meeting data and transcripts.\n",
    "Meeting participants discussed remote control design specifications, including components, user interface, and market trends.  The design team considered materials like plastic, wood, latex, titanium, and rubber for the casing. Button options included pushbuttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. Internal components included simple, regular, or advanced circuit boards and chips, and kinetic, solar, or traditional batteries. The user interface presentation focused on essential functions, such as channel and volume control, and additional features accessible through menus, possibly using a small LCD screen on the remote or an on-screen television display. Market research indicated a growing consumer preference for fashionable remotes, with fruit and vegetable shapes and spongy textures trending. Participants debated the practicality and cost-effectiveness of these trends, along with the inclusion of a scroll wheel and the target demographic.  A universal remote compatible with various devices was deemed potentially too complex and costly, with a focus on televisions suggested.  The company's corporate color, slogan, and a possible tracking device were additional considerations.  Participants also discussed the remote\u2019s shape, size, button placement, and ergonomics, with a preference for one-handed operation.  The possibility of a two-piece design, with one part for quick channel and volume control and another for additional functions, was also explored.\n",
    "Early implementer areas for the Welsh Government's childcare offer have provided valuable lessons.  A primary challenge is the administrative burden of requiring parents to submit documentation like wage slips and birth certificates to prove eligibility. This process is cumbersome for local authorities and particularly challenging for families with complex situations.  Additionally, implementing the offer in select areas within a local authority has created confusion and frustration for families residing outside the designated pilot zones.  They question why they lack access while neighbors receive childcare support.  Similarly, those within the pilot areas question why they qualify for certain benefits but not the childcare offer. These experiences highlight the need for a streamlined, centralized system.\n\nThe current administrative burden stems from the individualized eligibility checks and constant adjustments based on fluctuating work patterns and salaries.  The Welsh Government acknowledges these difficulties and seeks to transition to a model similar to that used by HM Revenue and Customs.  This centralized approach would simplify the process for parents and local authorities by sharing information between government departments, minimizing paperwork and confusion.  The government intends to learn from the phased rollout and apply those lessons to the full rollout in 2020.  The phased approach allows for adjustments based on economic and cultural factors, such as the tradition of informal childcare provided by family members in some areas.  It also allows the government to address capacity concerns, regional variations in childcare costs and types, and workforce development needs as they arise.\n",
    "The Project Manager spearheaded the discussion on the product's features, focusing on balancing innovation with cost constraints.  They championed the voice recognition aspect, initially conceived as a remote locator, seeing its potential as a key selling point and a differentiator in a competitive market.  However, they expressed reservations about the practicality of relying solely on speech control due to potential interference and usability issues.  They advocated against incorporating an LCD screen, deeming it an unnecessary cost for a universal remote with limited displayable information.  Regarding button design, the Project Manager favored a classic rubber button approach to minimize microchip usage and keep costs down while maintaining durability.  They also expressed a preference for the proposed plastic casing with a rubberized outer shell for enhanced grip and robustness, aligning with the company's image of durable products.  The Project Manager acknowledged the market research indicating a preference for larger remotes but aimed for a compromise between size and aesthetics.  Cost constraints led to the difficult decision to abandon the solar cell feature, despite its alignment with the initial \"environmental\" marketing strategy.  Ultimately, the Project Manager prioritized the charging cradle and voice recognition as the core unique selling propositions for the remote.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed improving audio quality for various research purposes, including dialogue analysis and prosody studies. They decided to standardize on head-mounted microphones for better signal capture and consistency, addressing concerns about variations introduced by different microphone types and placements.  They also discussed the challenges transcribers faced with varied audio quality, particularly from lapel microphones.  The team acknowledged the benefits of microphone arrays and video recording, but deemed them impractical for their current focus on impromptu meetings and available resources. They also explored the possibility of partnering with researchers interested in microphone arrays and video data, offering meeting access and transcripts.  While video recording was deemed desirable by some for studying non-verbal communication, concerns about human subjects' issues and lack of a dedicated researcher to manage the process hindered its implementation.  The team prioritized improving the existing audio setup and explored software solutions to enhance audio quality, such as post-processing waveforms and speaker separation techniques. They also considered collecting data from more diverse meeting types to enrich their corpus.\n",
    "The team discussed project finance at length, noting the need to create a realistic budget for the remote control project.  They considered various cost-saving measures, such as using a regular chip instead of an advanced chip, eliminating the LCD screen, and simplifying the casing design. They also discussed target pricing for the remote and how it would affect their marketing and sales strategies.  The ultimate goal was to present a financially sound plan to management.\n\nThe SMARTboard, a digital whiteboard, was utilized during the meetings.  The team found the digital pen aspect of the SMARTboard more intuitive and user-friendly than the board itself. They suggested integrating the drawing capabilities directly into PowerPoint for a more seamless workflow.  The digital pen allowed for real-time sketching and annotation, which proved helpful, particularly for design discussions and sharing visual ideas with the team. However, there were some technical issues with the SMARTboard, including difficulty drawing on the lower portion of the screen and lines not appearing where expected.  Despite these challenges, the team generally found the digital pen to be a valuable tool.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer, Nathan, focused on the remote's physical attributes. He advocated for high-quality, durable materials like a rubber coating, highlighted the slide-out panel for advanced functions, and suggested interchangeable faceplates for customization. He also expressed concern about the remote's cost and proposed alternative button types to reduce expenses.  He was disappointed by the decision to remove the solar panel feature due to budget constraints.\n\nThe Project Manager, Marty, guided the discussions, focusing on market viability and cost-effectiveness.  He emphasized the need for a universal remote compatible with various formats and devices.  He also stressed the importance of an original and trendy design to align with the company's strategy.  From the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the prototype remote generally met the design criteria, functioning as expected and possessing the desired aesthetic qualities. The pull-out panel presented some initial challenges but ultimately proved user-friendly.  The voice recognition feature also worked well within the required range.  He noted the product was over budget, requiring adjustments such as the removal of the solar cells to meet the target cost.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not contain a discussion of remotes. The meeting was focused on education reform in Wales.  Specifically, the meeting covered teacher training and professional development, curriculum development, student assessment, school performance measures, and support for disadvantaged students.  The meeting participants discussed how schools were using pupil development grant funding, the effectiveness of that funding, and how schools could better target resources to improve outcomes for students eligible for free school meals.  There was also discussion of the effectiveness of the Schools Challenge Cymru program, the role of Estyn in inspecting schools, and the impact of government reforms on the education system.\n",
    "The team discussed various aspects of a new remote control design.  A key discussion point was the selection of environmentally friendly materials.  While a titanium casing was initially considered, market research indicated a preference for natural, spongy materials, possibly rubber, aligning with the current trend of incorporating fruit and vegetable themes in design.  The team also explored the possibility of using solar power or kinetic energy as a power source, potentially combined with traditional batteries.\n\nColor was another important consideration.  The younger target demographic (15-35 years old) expressed a preference for colorful designs, suggesting the use of vibrant, fruit-inspired colors for the remote casing. Exchangeable covers, similar to those available for the Siemens C25 phone, were also suggested.\n\nThe team debated the inclusion of an LCD screen but decided against it due to cost and redundancy, given that TVs already display channel and volume information.  A central question was the feasibility and practicality of incorporating voice recognition. While the technology was popular among younger users, concerns were raised about interference from television audio and the need to point the remote at the TV for infrared functionality.  Alternatives like a beeper function for locating the remote were discussed.\n\nRegarding the remote's layout, traditional push-buttons were favored for ease of use, though the inclusion of scroll wheels and a scroll bar was considered. The placement of volume buttons on the side, similar to Nokia phones, was also suggested to improve ergonomics.  The team ultimately decided on a double-curved design with rubber buttons, voice recognition as an optional feature, and a regular chip (as opposed to the more advanced, LCD-supporting chip).  A prototype was to be developed based on these specifications.  Finally, a questionnaire was distributed to gather further feedback and refine the design.\n",
    "The project manager introduced the new television remote control project, emphasizing the goals of originality, trendiness, user-friendliness, affordability, and profitability. The user interface designer, Kendra, highlighted the importance of simplicity and clear labeling, while the industrial designer focused on signal reception and dependable functionality.  The team discussed the pros and cons of multi-functional and single-functional remotes, with Kendra favoring a combined TV/DVD player functionality.  There's no mention of lower technology grades in these transcripts. However, the team decided against incorporating LCD screens or voice control to keep costs down and development streamlined.  The addition of a locator light was discussed for ease of use in dark rooms.  The industrial designer suggested a pear or banana shape for the remote, which the team viewed as ergonomic and innovative.\n",
    "PhDs A and C did not participate in these meetings.  These transcripts are from a Welsh Government meeting and a Canadian Parliament meeting.  Neither meeting included discussion of variance, Jose, overlaps, or problems and difficulties faced due to overlaps.\n",
    "The meeting discussions centered around system latency, specifically focusing on challenges encountered with the PDA microphones. The professor expressed concern over the latency introduced by various components in the system, including the LDA filters and the online normalization recursion for mean estimation. Although the team explored strategies to mitigate the latency, such as low-pass filtering before downsampling and accounting for the recursion delay, no definitive solution was reached. The professor emphasized the need for better coordination between the two research groups to address the latency issue more effectively. He pointed out that the strict latency requirements had not been adequately considered, leading to the other group consuming the entire latency budget without realizing the impact.\n\nThe duration of the latency was not explicitly stated, but the discussions highlighted that the feature vectors were calculated every 10 milliseconds, raising concerns about the filters' effectiveness at 50 Hz.  The professor's primary issue was the lack of coordination and consideration for the strict latency requirements, resulting in an unsatisfactory situation.  He advocated for a more collaborative approach to find a suitable resolution.\n",
    "User Interface introduced two remote control designs: a multi-function remote and an easy-to-use remote. The multi-function remote offered numerous possibilities but lacked tactile feedback. Conversely, the easy-to-use remote had fewer options but provided a satisfying button feel. User Interface favored the easy-to-use model due to its user-friendliness and potential for trendy design.  They proposed combining aspects of both remotes while eliminating teletext buttons to align with updated project requirements.  A key feature of the proposed design was a simplified user interface with a minimal number of buttons, contributing to cost-effectiveness and allowing for a focus on aesthetics and other features.  The team explored innovative control methods, such as a stick or a four-directional button, to replace traditional buttons and enhance user experience.  Ultimately, the goal was to create a remote that appeared simple and user-friendly on the surface but incorporated sophisticated underlying functionality.\n",
    "The prototype remote was initially conceived as a universal remote. However, due to cost and complexity concerns, the team decided to focus on a TV remote. Two versions of the prototype were developed. The first, deemed impractical, was a sphere requiring two hands to operate: one to hold the base and the other to rotate the ball to change channels.  This version also included a microphone array for voice control. The second, ultimately accepted prototype, nicknamed the \u201cmushroom\u201d or \u201cpineapple,\u201d due to its shape and color scheme, features a rounded, ergonomic design comfortable for one-handed use. A prominent, rotating top portion, resembling a mushroom cap or pineapple crown, allows for channel surfing, while a smaller, more precise scroll wheel facilitates fine-tuning. This version retains voice control as a secondary function and incorporates solar cells for power.  The color scheme includes the corporate colors of yellow and red, with the slogan \u201cWe put the fashion in electronics\u201d displayed prominently. While concerns were raised regarding the cost of the solar cells and the unconventional design, the team ultimately agreed that the unique appearance and user-friendly interface would be marketable.  The marketing team will conduct further research on consumer preferences regarding the design and functionality of the remote.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the incorporation of a touch screen, ultimately deciding against it due to budget constraints.  Instead, they opted for a flip-top design with an LCD screen on the top and rubberized buttons on the bottom.  This approach allowed for a balance of advanced features and cost-effectiveness.  The LCD screen provided a modern interface, while the rubberized buttons maintained a familiar tactile experience.\n\nBattery life was a major concern.  Several options were explored, including standard batteries (AA and AAA), dynamo charging, solar charging, and kinetic charging. Dynamo and standard batteries were deemed too bulky or impractical. Solar charging, though appealing for its environmental friendliness, was considered expensive and vulnerable to damage from being dropped.  The team eventually settled on kinetic charging, using a small watch-type battery, believing it offered a good balance of cost, size, and convenience.  However, market research on the feasibility and consumer perception of kinetic charging was proposed.\n\nThe flip-top design itself was discussed in terms of its form factor and materials.  A shell-like shape was favored for its novelty.  While titanium was considered for the casing due to its strength and light weight, plastic was ultimately chosen for its cost-effectiveness and flexibility in design.  To address the consumer desire for a \"spongy feel,\" a removable rubber sleeve was proposed. This would allow for customizable colors and textures, aligning with the trend-watching research from Paris and Milan that highlighted fruit and vegetable colors and spongy materials.  The rubber sleeve also provided a cost-effective way to offer different styles and potentially address concerns about the \"fancy look and feel\" desired by the target market.\n",
    "Schools Challenge Cymru, a three-year program, yielded mixed results with some schools demonstrating significant improvement while others lagged.  The Welsh Government acknowledges the variability of the program's success, attributing it to factors such as school leadership, the complexity of the challenges faced by individual schools, and the effectiveness of the support advisers assigned to them.  A key lesson learned is the crucial role of strong school leadership in driving improvement.\n\nThe program invested heavily in regional school improvement capacity, which is considered a positive and lasting legacy. This investment aimed to address the limited capacity of individual local authorities and nascent regional consortia to support school improvement.  The government maintains that the program's lessons, including the importance of robust tracking systems, teacher quality, and collaborative working, are embedded in the national mission for educational improvement and disseminated through regional consortia.  Several successful advisers from Schools Challenge Cymru transitioned to roles within these consortia to broaden the application of their expertise.  The government contends that the current system of challenge, advice, and support, along with the schools categorization system, enables more targeted and intensive support for schools needing intervention, including primary schools, which were not included in the original Schools Challenge Cymru program.  While some stakeholders suggested a longer program duration, the Welsh Government emphasizes the program's initial design as time-limited, with a focus on building regional capacity for sustained improvement.  The government also highlights instances of sustained improvement in schools after the program's conclusion, citing examples like Tredegar Comprehensive School and Eastern High.\n",
    "Dr. Blaney believes that Brexit has had a demonstrably negative impact on Welsh higher education.  He notes an 8% decrease in EU student applications to Welsh universities compared to a 2% rise in England.  He attributes this to two main factors. Firstly, changes to student support arrangements, where EU students are no longer eligible for tuition fee grants, create uncertainty even though the overall cost of studying in Wales is now comparable to, or even slightly cheaper than, England.  Secondly, he acknowledges the superior facilities and campuses in many English universities due to higher levels of investment, which makes them more attractive to prospective students, both domestic and international.\n\nTo counter this trend, Dr. Blaney highlights the \"Study in Wales\" campaign. This initiative emphasizes the strengths of Welsh universities, including smaller, safer campuses, a supportive environment, and the prestige of a UK degree. He believes this targeted approach will help distinguish Wales within the broader UK higher education landscape.  While acknowledging the difficulties in competing with better-funded English institutions, Dr. Blaney stresses the Welsh sector's commitment to providing high-quality education in a welcoming environment.\n",
    "The mental spaces framework, as discussed in the transcripts, incorporates multiple layers.  The bottom layer, \"scenario,\" details the specific predications and events within a given utterance. It utilizes image and X-schemas, with slots like \"agent,\" \"aspectual type,\" \"perspective,\" and image schema roles (\"container,\" \"path,\" \"goal,\" \"force,\" etc.).  Information structure elements like focus are also included.  The middle layer, \"reference,\" connects the utterance-specific elements to a broader discourse context. It contains information about the referents mentioned in the utterance (e.g., \"Harry,\" \"the room\"), including grammatical features (number, gender), status (e.g., in child language), and discourse segment information. Crucially, this layer links to a separate, more general list of entities in the overall discourse, handling discourse status (active, accessible, inaccessible) and managing how referents are tracked across utterances.  This middle layer acts as a bridge, mapping specific mentions in the utterance to their broader discourse context and potentially to entities in an ontological knowledge base.  It helps resolve references, manage information status, and track entities across the discourse. The top layer, encompassing the discourse situation context record, is not fully detailed in the transcripts but represents the broader discourse and situational context.  It includes active entities in the discourse and potentially links to general cultural frames and other background knowledge.  Mental spaces, including conventionalized ones like \"past\" and more complex ones like hypothetical scenarios, are to be integrated into this framework, potentially by treating context itself as a type of mental space.\n",
    "The professor expressed concern about the Meeting Recorder's back-end processing speed due to his limited Tcl-TK programming skills. He planned to collaborate with Don to address this issue, specifically focusing on indexing meeting transcripts by meeting type and user ID.  He also discussed the need for increased scratch disk space to accommodate the expanded meeting data required for transcription, chunking, and permission forms.  The professor suggested using newly acquired Sun Blades or utilizing available space on existing machines like Samosa to alleviate the storage limitations.  Longer-term solutions involving disk server expansion and network integration were also mentioned but require consultation with Dave Johnson, the system administrator.\n",
    "Discussions surrounding the seniors care crisis highlighted the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on marginalized communities, particularly within long-term care facilities.  Concerns were raised about elder abuse and neglect, exemplified by significant death tolls in facilities like Camilla Care.  While there was a call for improvements in long-term care, some members expressed concern over the removal of vital safeguards in euthanasia regulations.  The intersection of racism and long-term care was also discussed, with one member asserting that the Indian Act of 1876 enshrined racism into Canadian law and that systemic racism continues to affect Indigenous peoples, leading to tragic outcomes.\n\nAmendments to policies protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were debated. Concerns arose regarding the impact of corporate bankruptcies on workers' pensions and benefits, with calls for stronger legal protections.  There was also discussion about the need for more flexible employment insurance programs for forestry workers, similar to those available for oil and gas workers. The Canada Summer Jobs program was a recurring topic, with questions raised about funding delays, the impact of COVID-19 on student hiring, and concerns about Indigenous communities being denied funding.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay's perspective, gleaned from discussions about veterans' affairs, emphasized the importance of public debate concerning policies and programs affecting veterans and their families.  He stated his willingness to consider input on veterans' compensation and affirmed the government's commitment to providing appropriate support. Questions arose regarding the ombudsman's report comparing veteran benefit regimes and the practice of \"red-flagging\" veteran files.\n\nThe Minister of Seniors' statement on pandemic assistance was not explicitly mentioned in these transcripts. However, discussions touched upon pandemic-related assistance for seniors, such as increased GIS and OAS payments, and the need for further support for the most vulnerable seniors. Additionally, the importance of supporting those who care for seniors, including long-term care staff and family members, was acknowledged.\n",
    "The disagreements stemmed from differing priorities and a lack of clear direction initially.  The Industrial Designer prioritized cost-effectiveness, suggesting infrared technology and a wired remote, while also proposing wireless for practicality. This conflicted with Marketing's user research, which revealed a strong user preference for wireless remotes and a dislike of excessive buttons.  The Project Manager, initially unclear about the remote's scope, added to the confusion.  While the Industrial Designer focused on technical feasibility and cost, Marketing emphasized user experience and aesthetics (e.g., a \"fancy\" look, potentially with interchangeable faceplates).  Further disagreements arose concerning color options (yellow versus other colors) and the inclusion of teletext functionality, which the Project Manager ultimately deemed unnecessary.  The debate over integrating control for other devices highlighted the tension between creating a simple, user-friendly remote versus a multifunctional, potentially complex one.  Ultimately, they agreed to prioritize a good television remote, possibly catering to a niche market like users with disabilities, before considering more complex functionalities.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation by first collecting criteria based on user requirements and trends identified through market research and the company's marketing strategy.  These criteria included a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, incorporation of current fashion trends (specifically spongy texture and fruit/vegetable colors), minimization of RSI, and ease of location.  Marketing then led the team through an evaluation process where each member rated the design against these criteria on a scale of 1 to 7 (1 being high and 7 being low).  Individual ratings were recorded and averaged to determine the overall score for each criterion.  The team discussed the ratings and whether modifications were needed before proceeding with prototyping and marketing.\n",
    "Transcription and recordings are about to be collected.  A new scenario has been developed to elicit natural user intentions. Subjects will choose high-level tasks, take notes on a schematic map, and then interact with the system to achieve their chosen goals.  This approach aims to avoid subjects simply parroting pre-written task descriptions.\n\nRegarding the SPG (Source-Path-Goal) schema's integration, an XML schema is under development.  It includes Action Schema, SPG Schema, and intermediate categories like \"Enter,\" \"View,\" and \"Approach.\"  Action Schema is a broad category, while the SPG Schema holds specific features like Source, Path, and Goal. Intermediate categories like \"Enter\" fall under the SPG action category and will have corresponding schema definitions.  The current implementation has limitations, such as not handling multiple simultaneous intentions well, and the team is discussing alternative schema organizations.  The goal is to create a flexible system that can represent multiple schemas and actions in parallel, accommodating complex user goals and intentions.  XML examples are being developed for the next meeting to clarify the schema's syntax and usage.  Additionally, bindings between frame-specific roles (e.g., \"viewed thing\") and more general SPG roles are being considered.  The team is actively discussing how to best represent hierarchical relationships and identify identical elements across different schemas using mechanisms like X-path.\n",
    "In addressing the proposed amendments, the Deputy Minister, Julie Morgan, responded to concerns across groups related to the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers.  Regarding public awareness, she committed to a six-year, high-intensity campaign starting after Royal Assent. She argued against amendments specifying target groups (like visitors) or topics (parenting support) within the Bill, stating these could be addressed by the expert groups advising the government. She believed the term \"awareness\" was sufficient and \"understanding,\" as used in the Scottish Bill, was unnecessary.  She also felt specifying how to report concerns about physical punishment was redundant, as safeguarding was already a public duty.\n\nOn reporting the legislation's effect, the Deputy Minister agreed to a post-implementation review, structured as a continuous process rather than a single report.  This would include attitudinal surveys and data collection through a dedicated task force.  She agreed to discuss with the committee the contents of an interim three-year report, addressing the concern about the initially proposed seven-year timeframe. She resisted a pre-commencement report on the awareness campaign, claiming it would conflict with the agreed timeline.\n\nRegarding regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister proposed an amendment restoring the power to make transitory provisions connected to Section 1 coming into force.  She argued this was technical and maintained that no procedure was necessary for this power. She did not see the need for wider regulation-making powers but agreed to discuss the matter further with the committee before Stage 3.  Throughout, she emphasized collaboration with stakeholders and the thoroughness of the impact assessments, citing evidence from other jurisdictions to support her positions.\n",
    "Discussions on raising standards and improving educational attainment highlighted concerns about the availability of learning resources, particularly textbooks, for new qualifications.  The rapid pace of reforms, influenced by England's schedule, created pressure on the system, leaving insufficient time for resource development and teacher preparation. The emphasis on digital resources, while valuable, raised concerns about digital literacy and equitable access for all learners, especially those in areas with limited broadband access.  There was disagreement on the necessity of textbooks as core resources.  While some viewed them as essential, especially for traditional learners, others expressed concerns about \u201cteaching to the test\u201d and advocated for textbooks as broader curriculum resources, potentially developed at the subject level rather than aligned with specific specifications.  The current model, where new textbooks are published for each specification change, was questioned, with some suggesting a shift towards a curriculum-focused model, similar to practices in some US states or a de-emphasis on textbooks as seen in Hong Kong.\n\nPhilip Blaker emphasized Qualification Wales' role in regulating awarding bodies, focusing on qualification design, assessment delivery, and maintaining standards through processes like comparable outcomes.  He suggested reviewing the current regulations, which preclude examination bodies from commercial links with textbook providers, and raised the possibility of a common core of bilingual resources.  Blaker also stressed the importance of system readiness, advocating for realistic timelines in future reforms to avoid repeating past issues.  He suggested that Qualifications Wales has the power to delay qualifications, but not the curriculum, if implementation conditions aren't suitable.\n\nThe lack of timely textbooks, particularly in Welsh, was a recurring theme.  The Welsh Government provides funding for Welsh translations, but concerns were raised about the efficiency of the translation process, the quality of translated materials, and the delays in publishing Welsh versions.  A trial was mentioned where English textbook publication would be delayed to coincide with the Welsh version's release, but this approach was met with criticism, especially when English textbooks were already late.  The WJEC expressed willingness to explore different models, including producing Welsh-medium textbooks first.  The discussion also touched upon the broader issue of resource development for the new curriculum, with emphasis on early planning, stakeholder collaboration, and the role of Welsh Government in supporting bilingual resource creation. There were concerns about the tight timeline for curriculum implementation and the need for clarity on the curriculum's content to facilitate resource development. The role of commercial publishers, the need for government subsidies, and the potential for the WJEC to expand its role in resource development were also discussed.\n",
    "Discussions highlighted the difficulty of consistently implementing good practices across Wales, especially regarding childcare services.  Varying historical levels of childcare provision and localized decision-making by authorities created an uneven playing field.  The geographical targeting of Flying Start, while beneficial for included areas, raised concerns about equity for disadvantaged children outside those zones, especially given data indicating a significant percentage of children in poverty falling behind developmentally.  Ensuring consistent access to technology for vulnerable children needing to contact social workers and other key professionals was also identified as a challenge.  The complexity of the current childcare system, with multiple funding streams and eligibility criteria, was acknowledged as needing simplification.  Finally, the discussion touched upon the impact of potential school closures on childcare access, particularly for key workers, and the financial vulnerability of childcare providers, including Cylch Meithrin, if forced to close. The potential loss of these providers was recognized as a serious threat to the childcare sector's recovery post-pandemic.\n",
    "Meeting participants discussed the availability of components for the remote control.  A primary concern was the case material. Options included plastic, wood, and titanium.  Wood was deemed impractical, and while titanium offered a sleek look, it was expensive and prone to damage.  Plastic was the most cost-effective and allowed for flexible design, including a proposed flip-top model. A rubberized cover for the plastic case was suggested to provide a trendy, spongy feel, aligning with market research.  The rubber cover could be produced in various colors, particularly fruit and vegetable-inspired hues, catering to younger demographics.\n\nThe interface design also generated discussion.  A touch screen LCD interface was favored for the inside of the flip-top, offering a modern aesthetic and flexibility for button placement.  For frequently used buttons like volume and channel controls, physical rubber buttons were proposed for the exterior of the device, potentially incorporating anti-RSI features.  The placement of these buttons, whether vertically or horizontally, was debated, with usability tests suggested to determine the optimal layout.  The inclusion of a stylus was also considered.\n\nAdditional features were explored, such as voice recognition for locating the remote, a docking station for kinetic charging, and a small, embedded mirror. Cost implications and market demand were key factors in determining which features would be included in the final design.

Regarding the discussion on time series, reverberation, and pronouncing zero, there is no mention of these topics in the provided transcripts.\n",
    "The new remote control project was discussed with decisions reached on several concepts.  Kinetic energy, supplemented by a battery, will power the remote.  A single-curved, rubberized case in \u201cflashy fruity colors\u201d with removable covers will enclose the device.  An LCD screen and advanced chipset were chosen over traditional buttons and a simple chipset.  A log-in function for parental control was deemed important by the marketing team who saw it as a significant selling point, despite concerns from the industrial designer regarding programming time.  Ultimately, the parental control will be included as a selectable personal preference upon purchase.  The team decided against including games on the remote.  While voice recognition is viewed as desirable and inexpensive to implement, concerns were raised about its functionality given the ambient noise present when watching television.  It will, however, be included as a feature.  Finally, the remote will project a brief animation upon activation, reinforcing the Real Reaction brand.\n",
    "Vaughan Gething did not participate in these meetings, therefore, there is no discussion from him to summarize.  The meeting transcripts provided are from Canadian parliamentary proceedings.  The discussion included topics such as COVID-19's impact on various sectors (agriculture, tourism, energy, small businesses), government financial aid programs (CERB, wage subsidy, business loans), support for individuals with disabilities and seniors,  Taiwan's inclusion in the WHO,  and  the reopening of the Canadian economy.  There was also discussion about alleged fraud in the CERB program, funding for the Auditor General, and the government's firearms ban.  The discussion involved various members of parliament and government ministers.  There was no mention of suicide crime evaluations or special care for pregnant women.\n",
    "Implementation work on the new curriculum will begin across all primary school grade levels and will be phased in year by year for secondary schools beginning in the 2020-2021 school year.  The strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones is tasked with ensuring clear roles and responsibilities in the middle tier to support implementation and avoid the risk of losing focus. The group was initially formed to address concerns about duplication of effort and a confusion of roles within the middle tier, but its focus has expanded to encompass broader support for the new curriculum.  Some concern was expressed that this broadening could dilute the group's impact, but the Minister for Education believes they remain very focused on their core mission.\n\nNetworking within the PRU sector has improved, particularly regarding professional learning and collaboration with schools.  Transition arrangements for pupils returning to mainstream education from PRUs involve part-time integration back into school with continued support and a managed reduction of that support over time.  Reintegration is more challenging for older pupils in key stage 4, particularly those nearing the end of their statutory education.  Transportation for EOTAS learners in rural areas was also raised as a concern.\n",
    "The infrared functionality was considered essential.  One member stated that infrared was the best way for the remote to communicate with the television because it did not require a sightline. Another member discussed the importance of a reliable and clear infrared signal.  There was also a brief discussion on how to improve the functionality of the infrared, and it was suggested that the quality of the battery and chip would play a role in this.\n\nDisposable income was discussed in relation to the target demographic for the remote. It was noted that the younger demographic (15\u201325) had more disposable income than previously thought because they typically did not have large expenses such as mortgages or car payments.  The group determined that the target demographic would likely have disposable income to spend on technology.  They also considered whether the remote would be sold separately from a television or bundled together, noting this could impact the target consumer.  Ultimately, the price point of 25 Euros was considered affordable even for younger consumers.\n",
    "Estyn and Welsh Government representatives agree that eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is an imperfect but currently necessary measure for identifying disadvantaged students. They acknowledge a \u201cblurring\u201d where schools use the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for all underachieving students or for school-wide programs like \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d training, rather than exclusively for those eligible for FSM.  However, they emphasize that individual interventions must target FSM-eligible students and that school-wide interventions should demonstrate a disproportionate benefit to this group.  They also stress the importance of using PDG funds to support high-achieving FSM students, citing examples like the \u201cwindow on the world\u201d bus.  A concern is raised regarding the difficulty of tracking the impact of PDG on specific cohorts like adopted children due to data limitations and privacy concerns.\n\nWhile PDG is intended to improve attendance and engagement, particularly for FSM students, the gap persists.  Estyn reports only two-thirds of schools use PDG effectively, citing leadership as a key factor.  Successful interventions include staff going into the community to ensure student attendance and employing staff to work with families.  Despite PDG, the attainment gap hasn't closed significantly, leading to discussions about whether the funding is sufficient to address deep societal challenges.  Some improvements are noted, such as increased attendance and engagement with the curriculum, but there's recognition that more work is needed. The group also discussed the need for greater flexibility in PDG allocation, considering models like \"Ever 2\" rather than \"Ever 6\" due to funding constraints.\n",
    "The professor discussed various approaches to speech recognition, including support vector machines and algorithms focused on speech rate.  A graduate student was exploring support vector machines for classifying phonological features, drawing inspiration from previous work that used recurrent neural nets. The professor explained the concept of support vectors as analogous to condensed nearest neighbors, offering potential advantages in efficiency compared to neural nets or Gaussian mixture models, especially with limited data. While acknowledging prior research using support vector machines for speech recognition with moderate success, the professor questioned their effectiveness for large-scale tasks. The discussion also touched upon deriving probabilities from support vector machine outputs for use in speech recognition.  Regarding speech rate, the professor discussed a method involving mean subtraction over a six-second window, which showed promising error reduction in noisy conditions. They explored the potential benefits of applying this method to a more robust system trained on diverse datasets, but also acknowledged its limitations in handling additive noise.  A further discussion revolved around spectral analysis, including using LPC-derived spectra, spectral subtraction, and the influence of noise on voiced/unvoiced detection. The professor suggested adding noise to training data as a potential strategy for mitigating the impact of additive noise.  They also explored the concept of \"TRAPS,\" which involves analyzing time trajectories of spectral energy within critical bands, and discussed the potential of incorporating information from neighboring bands to improve recognition.  Finally, they discussed the importance of proper normalization techniques and the potential benefits of adjusting the relative importance of different cepstral coefficients.\n",
    "The professor expresses interest in several key acoustic phenomena related to meetings. He finds the sheer number of overlaps in relatively short meetings to be noteworthy and believes it is important to quantify this compared to other conversational settings.  He emphasizes the importance of studying overlaps where both speakers are equally audible, particularly from a single microphone perspective, as this presents significant challenges for speech processing. While acknowledging the existence of overlaps in other corpora like Switchboard, he highlights that the meeting corpus allows for direct investigation of this phenomenon due to its design, unlike Switchboard where overlap was not a primary consideration. He also shows interest in different types of overlaps, such as benevolent, competitive, and hostile overlaps, suggesting further research into their characteristics and distribution. Finally, he proposes investigating the use of echo cancellation techniques to mitigate the effects of distant microphones in meeting recordings, despite the prevailing view that such methods are impractical due to factors like speaker movement and noise.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote control's user interface design.  Initially, they considered advanced features like a touch screen, LCD display, and voice control. However, due to cost concerns and the desire for a simple, user-friendly design, these were rejected.  The team decided on a simple button interface with basic functions: power, channel up/down, volume up/down, and a numerical keypad.  A lock button or cover was also suggested to prevent accidental button presses.\n\nThe team favored a double-curved, rubberized case for comfort and to address RSI concerns. This material choice necessitated rubber push-buttons.  To enhance the remote's appeal, they proposed offering it in a variety of colors, allowing for customer customization.  Although voice recognition was deemed desirable, it was ultimately excluded from the initial design due to budget constraints, with the possibility of inclusion in a later \"business class\" version.  The final design prioritized simplicity, user-friendliness, and a distinctive, marketable aesthetic.\n",
    "The project manager expressed satisfaction with the model's appearance, noting it was \"beautiful\" and aligned with their discussions. They questioned whether the bottom curvature for the hand would be single or double.

    "Local authoritative frameworks were not discussed during these meetings.\n\nCondolences were offered to the families of the Canadian Armed Forces members who died in a helicopter crash.  Condolences were also offered for the victims of the Nova Scotia mass shooting.\n\nSeveral members raised concerns about employment issues.  Many small businesses, sole proprietorships, and those in seasonal industries like tourism, agriculture, and fishing, were ineligible for many pandemic relief programs due to restrictive eligibility criteria.  There were calls to make the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) universal to cover everyone who lost work, as well as to increase the flexibility of programs to avoid disincentivizing work, especially for students.  Concerns were raised about delays in payments related to the Canada Summer Jobs program.  A gap in the wage subsidy program was identified for companies that had recently acquired other companies, rendering them ineligible even if they had significant revenue loss.\n\nWorkers' safety concerns were raised, particularly regarding meat-packing plants where COVID-19 outbreaks occurred.  Members questioned whether workers would lose benefits if they refused unsafe work.  The government stated that no one should work in unsafe conditions and that workers would not be penalized for refusing unsafe work.\n\nPay disputes were not directly addressed. However, members discussed the financial struggles of seniors, students, and other vulnerable groups, and called for increased financial support, such as increasing Old Age Security and allowing penalty-free RRSP withdrawals.  There was discussion of the financial challenges faced by businesses and individuals due to pandemic-related closures and reduced revenues, with members advocating for more government assistance and greater flexibility in relief programs.

    "Lab tests revealed users dislike current remotes\u2019 look and feel, 80% would pay more for a fancy remote, 75% of users \u201czap\u201d (flip channels), and 50% use only 10% of the buttons.  Frustrations included remotes being lost (50%), complexity (34%), and repetitive strain injury (RSI). Younger users favored LCD screens and speech recognition.\n\nThe group discussed a finder button, including beeping or flashing, possibly activated by a button on the TV.  They also discussed a call button for voice recognition, debating its feasibility given background TV noise and potential interference from commercials.  They considered limiting vocabulary to channel numbers, volume, and brightness controls.\n\nButton design and location were central to the discussions.  They considered touch screen panels instead of buttons, ergonomic shapes like a curled \u201cbanana,\u201d and minimizing the number of buttons by using a menu for less frequent functions. Placement of essential functions like power, channel, and volume was highlighted.  They also explored the \u201cflip-top\u201d design to hide complex functions.\n\nThe team agreed to omit lighting adaptive options from the presentation connecting the project to market interests, citing low user interest and complexity.\n",
    "The team expressed concerns about the timely availability of learning resources, particularly textbooks, for both English and Welsh-medium students.  Digital resources were viewed as a valuable supplement and a way to bridge gaps when printed materials were delayed, but concerns were raised about equitable access to technology.  The team acknowledged the importance of a core set of bilingual resources and questioned the current model where textbooks are tied to specific specifications, leading to frequent reprints and potentially encouraging \"teaching to the test.\"  They suggested exploring curriculum-focused textbooks instead, drawing inspiration from models in other countries like the US and Hong Kong.\n\nRegarding Welsh-medium resources, the team discussed the need for a more strategic approach to translation, prioritizing key materials and avoiding duplication of effort by individual schools.  Concerns were raised about the quality and clarity of translated materials, with an emphasis on developing resources bilingually from the outset whenever possible. The feasibility of a Welsh-first approach for resource creation was also briefly discussed.  The team acknowledged the financial challenges associated with bilingual resource development and suggested that subsidies would likely be necessary.\n\nThe team also discussed comparable outcomes, digital literacy, and the pressure on teachers to adapt existing resources to meet new specifications.  They highlighted the importance of considering different learning styles and the potential disadvantage faced by students who rely heavily on traditional textbooks.  The impact of the rapid pace of curriculum reform on resource availability and teacher preparedness was a significant concern. The team emphasized the need for better planning, longer lead times, and greater collaboration between stakeholders, including publishers, Welsh Government, Qualifications Wales, and the WJEC.  Finally, capturing subject intention and moving towards assessment models that prioritize analysis and evaluation were discussed as key goals, with the potential for allowing reference materials in exam settings.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control\u2019s general specifications and case design. Specifications included a plastic case with options for a flat, curved, or double-curved shape, with additional materials like wood, latex, titanium, or rubber. Buttons could be pushbuttons, scroll wheels, or an LCD screen.\u00a0Internal components included simple, regular, or advanced circuit boards and chips, and basic, kinetic, or solar batteries. The team favored a curved or double-curved case with various design elements, pushbuttons or a scroll wheel, a kinetic battery, and a simple or regular chip to minimize costs.\u00a0One member suggested the double-curved case could resemble two hands. Another noted the weight of titanium is very light.\u00a0User interface options included an LCD screen on the remote, a menu displayed on the television, or pushbuttons for essential functions with additional features accessed through a menu. The team liked the iPod\u2019s scroll wheel and menu system as a potential model, prioritizing frequently used functions with additional options available through the menu.\u00a0The team also explored having a small LCD screen on the remote or an on-screen display on the TV. They acknowledged the limitations of one-way communication with an LCD screen on the remote. The market research indicated a shift in consumer preference towards \u201cfancy look and feel\u201d remotes, prioritizing this over functionality and ease of use. Current fashion trends included fruits, vegetables, and spongy textures. Changeable covers in different colors and textures, similar to mobile phone cases, were suggested to incorporate fashion trends.  The team considered a spongy latex cover for better grip and a round or mobile phone-shaped remote.\u00a0They explored fruit and vegetable colors and shapes for the remote and buttons, and the possibility of scented remotes. The team decided on a two-layer, flip-open design with a plastic body, customizable covers, a black and white LCD touchscreen on the top layer, standard buttons on the bottom layer, a kinetic battery, voice recognition, and standard transmission using infrared. They discussed incorporating the logo and using a simple chip. The team evaluated their prototype against the criteria of fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, incorporation of current fashion trends (spongy texture and fruit/vegetable colors), minimization of repetitive strain injury (RSI), and ease of location.\u00a0They gave high ratings for meeting most specifications, with the lowest rating for RSI minimization.

He stressed the importance of careful implementation with adequate resources to support families and prevent unintended consequences. David acknowledged the strain on social services and advocated for investment in early intervention and prevention programs. He also emphasized the need for a major awareness-raising campaign to ensure public understanding and acceptance of the legislation.  While not explicitly stating whether this should be on the face of the Bill, he strongly supported making it a duty of Welsh Government Ministers to raise awareness.  David believed that with proper resourcing, unintended consequences could be avoided, but expressed concern over the potential impact on already overstretched social services. He underscored the need for Welsh Government to commit to meeting the costs of implementation, whatever they may be, to avoid compromising existing services for vulnerable families.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the two-sided remote control's design and functionality.  They considered a user-centered design with fewer buttons, prioritizing ease of use and a less cluttered appearance.  A flip-open design was suggested, with essential functions like power, channel, and volume readily accessible, while more complex functions could be placed on a second, hidden panel. This approach aimed to cater to a broader audience, balancing simplicity with advanced features.\n\nA key discussion point was voice recognition. While recognized as a desirable feature, especially among younger demographics, concerns arose regarding its feasibility and potential technical challenges, such as interference from television audio.  The team also explored the possibility of a buttonless remote controlled entirely by voice commands.  However, they acknowledged the need for a physical interface due to user familiarity with buttons and the risk of misinterpretation.  A combination of voice control and essential buttons was deemed the most practical approach.\n\nOther design considerations included incorporating the company's logo and color scheme, potentially through interchangeable fascias.  Ergonomics and the risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI) were also discussed, with suggestions like larger, rubberized buttons or a touch screen.  A unique shape, such as a curved design, was proposed to improve comfort and differentiate the remote from competitors.  Additionally, a locator feature, like a beeper activated by a button on the television, was suggested to address the common problem of lost remotes.  The team also explored alternative power sources, like rechargeable batteries or a docking station, to eliminate the need for replacements.  Finally, they briefly touched upon the instruction manual, aiming to make it user-friendly and less daunting than typical manuals.\n",
    "Group 3's amendments focused on the Bill's commencement and transitional provisions.  Julie Morgan introduced amendment 3, aiming to reinstate the existing power to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions connected to Section 1's enactment, after amendments 7 and 8 removed it.  Amendment 6 stipulated that this power would come into effect the day after Royal Assent.  She described these as technical amendments, adding that the removal of the Welsh Ministers' power to commence Section 1 by order would actually reduce the statutory instrument's scope.  Morgan maintained that scrutiny of the transitional powers would still be possible, even without a specific Assembly procedure.\n\nSuzy Davies proposed amendment 3A, a probing amendment, questioning the adequacy of the proposed powers.  Davies argued that the standard transitory, transitional, and saving provisions might not suffice, given the added complexity of the Bill with the inclusion of the awareness campaign and reporting requirements.  She suggested broader regulatory powers might be necessary for effective implementation of Section 1.  Davies proposed that the Assembly should have the opportunity to review any measures introduced under Section 1.  She also questioned whether Morgan's proposed powers extended beyond transitional measures.\n\nMorgan responded that while she didn't deem wider powers necessary at present, the matter would remain under review.  She agreed to discuss the issue with Davies before Stage 3.  Davies ultimately moved amendment 3A, highlighting it as a placeholder for further discussion.\n",
    "Brexit's impact on Welsh higher education institutions featured in discussions surrounding fee structures and access plans.  While the specific impacts were not detailed in these transcripts, the broader context of Brexit necessitates adjustments by institutions to navigate potential changes in tuition fees for EU students, research funding access, and international collaborations.  Protecting students' interests is a priority, with executives focused on ensuring clarity around fee implications and maintaining access for EU students.  \n\nRegarding PPE production, questions were raised about the local manufacturing capacity of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks within Canada.

Ultimately, they recommend a simple design with essential buttons, an LCD screen, and optional voice recognition, catering to a target demographic of 15-35 year olds.\n",
    "The Welsh Baccalaureate was the main topic of discussion, specifically its universal adoption, perceived advantages, and weaknesses.  Variability in how schools implemented the program created inconsistencies in student experiences and perceptions of its value. Some participants felt that the Welsh Baccalaureate was rigorous and beneficial, while others considered it a burden, particularly for students pursuing multiple A-levels.  The qualification's value to employers was also questioned, with some feeling that employers lacked understanding of the program, while others stated that even if employers understood it, the skills developed were already covered in other qualifications. Concerns were raised about the workload for teachers in assessing the Welsh Baccalaureate and the potential for \"spoon-feeding\" in some instances. The name \"Welsh Baccalaureate\" itself was criticized for not clearly reflecting the qualification's purpose.  Regarding university admissions, there was disagreement on whether the Welsh Baccalaureate was truly equivalent to an A-level and whether it disadvantaged Welsh students applying to universities outside Wales, particularly those in the Russell Group.  The Cabinet Secretary for Education expressed confidence in the qualification's value and the intention for universal adoption, while acknowledging the need for flexibility and further communication with stakeholders.  A key point of contention was whether universal adoption should be an entitlement or an obligation for students.\n",
    "The group discussed the evaluation criteria for their remote control project.  One member presented the technical design, identifying core components like the energy source, chip, and infrared transmitter, emphasizing simplicity. Another member presented user interface aspects, based on web research and user needs, suggesting essential buttons (on/off, channel numbers, volume) and the possibility of a menu button for additional functions. Teletext functionality was deemed outdated and excluded. The group agreed to focus on television control only, to maintain simplicity. Market research showed channel and volume control as primary user concerns, with other functions used minimally. Younger demographics (15-35) expressed interest in voice recognition.

The technical and user interface leads were tasked with developing component and user interface concepts, respectively, while the marketing lead was to monitor trends, particularly regarding voice recognition.\n",
    "The participants did not discuss using CDs for backup.\n\nThe participants discussed probability computations in the context of a Bayesian network for a computer navigation system.  They acknowledged the difficulty of accurately setting probabilities, particularly with numerous interconnected nodes and the exponential increase in required values as features grow.  They noted a current bias towards the \"Tango\" mode in their experimental setup and discussed the challenge of assigning meaningful probabilities, especially for less common scenarios. They also explored alternatives to representing \"unknown\" values, suggesting that not observing a variable might be preferable to including \"unknown\" as a specific value.\n\nThe experimental setup for the computer navigation system involved a Bayesian network with observable features like \"admission fee discussion,\" \"nice walls,\" and \"time of day\" connected to hidden variables like \"tourist,\" \"doing business,\" and \"in a hurry.\"  These hidden variables then influenced the output node representing navigation modes: \"Tango,\" \"Enter,\" or \"Vista.\"  The participants planned to refine the network by adding more nodes and features, including aspects like \"has door\" and discourse-related cues.  They also considered incorporating plan recognition to better understand user intentions.  The experimental data collection was in its early stages, with plans for a trial run using a \"wizard\" to interact with the system and elicit richer language data.  They also intended to explore scenarios with more explicit user intentions for entering a location or taking a picture.\n",
    "The team did not discuss symmetrical buttons. The Project Manager raised the point that the prototype remote seemed geared towards right-handed users, suggesting the creation of both right- and left-handed versions.  The team briefly discussed this, noting that families with both left- and right-handed members might require two remotes. One member pointed out that families share computers with right-handed mice, implying that a single remote could be used by everyone. The team ultimately decided against separate versions, prioritizing a single design.\n",
    "Welsh universities face financial challenges stemming from declining 18-year-old demographics, the Augar review in England, Brexit, and a pre-existing funding gap compared to English institutions.  Universities are managing these challenges through cost reduction, impacting staffing and potentially diminishing curriculum breadth and research capacity.  Reserves are not readily available as cash, with much tied up in university estates.  While universities are under stress, no immediate closures are anticipated.  Trinity Saint David's \"material uncertainty\" is linked to delayed funding, not operational failures.  HEFCW monitors university finances, forecasts, and borrowing, intervening when necessary to protect student interests.  Governing bodies provide oversight of university estates strategies, which are the primary drivers of university borrowing.  HEFCW also approves significant borrowing and monitors loan covenants.\n\nPart-time student numbers are increasing in Wales.  The Welsh Government aims to support lifelong learning and has allocated funding for part-time provision.  However, the diverse nature of part-time study requires further analysis to determine appropriate funding strategies.  Significant fee increases for part-time students are not anticipated.\n\nResearch funding has not increased in nine years, despite recommendations from the Diamond and Reid reviews.  This impacts Welsh universities' ability to compete for research grants and limits their capacity to develop emerging research strengths.  The Welsh Government recently allocated additional funds for research, but sustainable funding is needed.  HEFCW is working to improve Wales's integration into UK-wide research conversations and to increase access to UKRI funding.\n",
    "The group discussed voice recognition as a potential feature for their remote control device.  A primary advantage was the \"find\" function, allowing users to locate a misplaced remote by speaking a pre-recorded message. This was seen as a valuable addition, especially given the potential for a simple implementation using existing, cost-effective technology already present in other devices like coffee machines.  Furthermore, it differentiated their product from competitors with more sophisticated, and potentially more expensive, voice control features.\n\nHowever, concerns arose regarding the practicality and limitations of the proposed voice recognition. Doubts were raised about its ability to control the remote's core functions.  The example provided, \"good morning coffee machine,\" suggested limited functionality beyond simple responses to pre-recorded prompts.  Additionally, the effectiveness of voice recognition for an international market was questioned, citing potential difficulties for older demographics.  Cost considerations also played a role, as adding voice recognition, while potentially inexpensive, would still represent an additional expense.  Ultimately, the group decided to include voice recognition as an \"extra possibility,\" with further investigation needed to determine its feasibility and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer presented preliminary findings on remote control design.  They noted that excessive metal could cause signal interference and fire hazards, advocating for plastic, possibly recycled, instead, due to cost concerns related to potential lawsuits.  For the energy source, they suggested solar power with an alkaline battery backup.  They specified an infrared sender, silicon chip, multi-channel compatibility (PAL and NTSC), and a 200-foot range.  Later, they expressed concern about the rising cost of incorporating advanced technology like voice recognition and touch screens while maintaining the target price of 12.50 Euros. They also questioned the viability of interchangeable faceplates, considering it a potential gimmick and expressing doubt about the company's ability to assess that market.  They suggested a simple black and red interface for the touch screen and displaying the logo on the boot-up screen.\n\nThe team discussed battery options in the context of the touch screen requiring recharging.  Lithium batteries with a 20-year lifespan were considered but cost was a major concern.  The Industrial Designer questioned the affordability of including such a battery and whether consumers would purchase the remote without it.  The team ultimately decided to explore cutting-edge battery technology while keeping the 12.50 Euro target price in mind, with a simpler plastic design as a fallback option.  The Industrial Designer recommended a charger/rechargeable battery setup for the industrial design to address the common problem of losing remotes.  A docking station was suggested as both a functional and aesthetic solution, providing a \"home\" for the remote and potentially incorporating the desired \"fancy\" look.\n",

    "The team explored various energy sources for the remote, including basic batteries, a hand dynamo, kinetic energy, and solar cells.  They decided on kinetic batteries, particularly drawn to the innovative aspect and potential marketing appeal of a self-charging remote.  The team also discussed incorporating the kinetic aspect into the design, suggesting its activation through squeezing or movement.\n\nTechnological innovation was a significant consideration. While voice recognition was initially appealing, it was deemed too costly within the budget constraints.  A simpler, less expensive chip was chosen instead.  The team felt the remote's unique design and rubber material were innovative enough for the initial product launch, with voice recognition potentially added in a later, higher-priced version.  Bluetooth compatibility was also discussed but dismissed due to the lack of compatible televisions and higher costs.\n\nOverall, the team positively evaluated the remote's design. The unique rubber casing, chosen for its anti-RSI properties, durability, and potential for customization through various colors, was highly favored.  The team felt the design met the criteria from their market research regarding a fancy look and feel, incorporation of current fashion trends (spongy texture and bright colors), ease of use, and locatability.  Concerns about minimizing RSI were acknowledged, but the team felt confident in their chosen materials and the larger button sizes afforded by the design.  The final design was deemed cost-effective, marketable, and innovative, meeting the project goals and budget.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts provided do not contain discussions of technical issues, energy sources, or a project announcement email.  There was, however, discussion regarding difficulties families were having engaging with healthcare services during the pandemic, including routine vaccinations for children.  There was specific mention of one possible case in Wales of Kawasaki-like syndrome, but it was unconfirmed at the time of the meeting. No other specific samples or sensors were discussed.\n",
    "The last meeting focused on finalizing the design of a remote control. Key decisions included abandoning the snowman shape in favor of a more traditional design due to cost constraints.  An LCD screen, initially excluded, was reintroduced for displaying basic functions, navigable by a jog dial.  Advanced functions like brightness and contrast would also be accessible via the LCD screen and jog dial.  The team decided against a fully rubberized casing and multi-colored buttons to reduce costs.  The final design will be a single-color plastic case with a monochrome button pad, roughly palm-sized.  The company logo will be incorporated, and the possibility of varying button shapes was discussed.  A significant design change was the removal of the LCD panel on the remote itself; instead, the TV screen will display the current function.  This was deemed a necessary cost-saving measure.  The team also explored alternative user interface options, including voice recognition, a spinning wheel, and programmable buttons for different users.  Concerns about cost and practicality led to a preference for basic buttons, potentially augmented by voice control.

    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies AM expressed several concerns regarding the childcare offer.  David was worried about the administrative burden on local authorities inherent in verifying eligibility. Irranca-Davies acknowledged the burden and stated a preference for an HMRC-style system for streamlined administration.\n\nAffordability for low-income families was a shared concern.  David questioned the fairness of potential add-on costs for food and trips, pointing out the disproportionate impact on low-income families.  Irranca-Davies conceded that a fully equitable system with no additional charges would be ideal but argued that the current system was the most workable given funding constraints. He highlighted that parents are accustomed to differentiating between providers and their varying fee structures.  David also suggested subsidizing care provided by grandparents, but the Minister rejected this due to quality control issues and the educational component of the childcare offer.  He noted that registered, licensed grandparents could participate.\n\nRegarding the \u00a34.50 hourly rate, David questioned its adequacy in higher-cost areas like Cardiff and Newport, suggesting it could lead to a two-tiered system with wealthier families accessing better care. Irranca-Davies expressed confidence in the rate, emphasizing its universal nature and acceptance by providers.  He acknowledged the potential need for regional variations after piloting in Cardiff and Newport.  He also addressed concerns about the rate's sustainability given the rising national living wage, stating that adjustments would be considered if necessary.\n\nWorkforce quality and qualification were also discussed. David expressed concern about the childcare sector's fragility, citing the National Day Nurseries Association. Irranca-Davies countered that the offer would enhance the sector's resilience through capital investment and a workforce development plan.  He also addressed potential capacity issues, citing ongoing assessments and engagement with local authorities and providers to identify and address workforce gaps.\n",
    "PhD C experimented with online normalization, including training with separate means for silence and speech, and a variable time constant.  Professor B suggested analyzing the types of errors produced rather than just overall performance. PhD C also experimented with adding white noise below a threshold relative to the utterance\u2019s peak energy, finding it smoothed the MFCCs without significantly affecting recognition.  Professor B suggested varying the noise addition parameters. PhD C also found that using LDA filters derived from clean speech significantly improved noisy speech recognition.  There was a brief discussion about standardizing the number of MFCCs used, with 13 or 15 being the options.  Grad G discussed phase normalization, including experiments with unwrapping the phase (which worsened results) and the possibility of using complex arithmetic. Professor B and Grad G discussed scaling issues related to the complex log\u2019s Taylor expansion. Professor B suggested a demonstration of prosody work on meeting data, visualizing features and tasks like boundary detection.  There was discussion of phase normalization, including unwrapping (which yielded worse results) and complex arithmetic. Scaling related to the complex log\u2019s Taylor expansion was also mentioned. No opinions on phase normalization and quals were offered by PhD C or the professor.\n",
    "The discussion concerning important linguistic features, feature streams, the advantages of using Noisy-ORs, and transcription formalization appears in a conversation about a student's qualifying proposal.  The student is exploring building a multi-band system using sub-band features to train a detector for phonetic features such as sonorance.  The system uses an AND gate at the lower level with independent tests in each sub-band to determine the presence of the feature.  These feed into a soft OR gate at a higher level, which indicates the presence of the feature in the frame if any sub-band detector is triggered.  The student notes this method's robustness compared to full-band Gaussian mixture estimations.  They discuss various low-level detectors, such as measures of SNR and correlation, and the use of an EM algorithm to train parameters for logistic regression within the detectors. The discussion touches upon the origin of training targets for individual bands, noting the limitations of using smooth spectral envelopes and the challenge of human annotation for narrow-band features.  Alternative low-level detectors are explored, such as voicing and nasality, based on features a human annotator could reliably mark.  There are concerns about the practicality of having humans annotate for these features.  The discussion also notes the importance of training for a product of errors rule, the question of how to train intermediate levels of the system, and performance measurement for the detector.\n",
    "Discussions regarding system involvement in demos, backups, and note collection spanned several topics.  The group discussed utilizing THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, including keyword search functionality and potential integration with the Channeltrans interface.  They also explored using XML as a general format for various data types, including user databases and Key files, to facilitate information extraction and reformatting.  Regarding backups, the group considered storing Meeting Recorder data on non-backed-up disks to reduce overhead, but ultimately decided against it, favoring a combination of manual archives and backups.  The use of CrossPads for note-taking during meetings was also discussed, with concerns raised about infrastructure requirements and synchronization challenges.  Alternative solutions, such as using PDAs with wireless cards or a designated scribe to summarize meetings, were also proposed.\n\nProfessor B suggested scheduling periods for individuals to review meetings and provide summaries or notes, acknowledging the limitations of not having real-time context.  He also expressed a preference for returning one of the CrossPads, while retaining the other to explore potential student projects or increased usage if readily available.\n",
    "Discussions regarding HMRC arose during a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care.  Sian Gwenllian AM initiated the discussion by pointing out that collaboration with HMRC had ended, expressing frustration at the time and resources spent on a now-abandoned initiative.  She questioned why the collaboration had ended and the nature of the problems encountered.\n\nJulie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, clarified that the decision was primarily driven by the desire for a more flexible and expandable childcare offer. Working with HMRC would have imposed limitations on the Welsh Government's ability to adapt and broaden the offer's scope, particularly concerning the inclusion of parents in training and education.  While acknowledging that there were technical issues related to Welsh language standards, she emphasized that these were not the primary reason for the change.  She stated that HMRC could process bilingually but would struggle to meet the Welsh language standards required of the Minister.  This contradicted previous assurances given to the committee.\n\nJo-Anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty, added that HMRC's final cost proposals were significantly higher than initially presented, leading to the conclusion that working with local authorities would be more cost-effective and flexible.  This also allowed investment to remain within Wales.  This, too, contradicted previous evidence given to the committee, which favored HMRC as a way to reduce local authority administrative burdens.  The committee expressed concern at these conflicting accounts.\n\nMorgan defended the decision, stating that the exploratory work with HMRC had provided valuable insights, ultimately shaping the Welsh Government's current approach.  She highlighted the positive partnership with local authorities, who are now viewed as better equipped to handle the complexities and build relationships with families due to their proximity to the public.\n",
    "The professor expressed interest in using a belief net (Bayesian network) to model and infer user intentions in a tourist information system. He suggested three core intentions: View, Enter, and Tango (approach).  He questioned whether existing tools, like the SmartKom system's M3L output (or \"analyzed speech,\" later referred to as \"intention lattices\"), provided sufficient information for this task, noting the need to incorporate contextual factors like time of day and object type. He favored an interactive belief net package, like JavaBayes, for its GUI capabilities and potential integration with Java libraries for XML handling. The team discussed features to include in the belief net, like linguistic cues, discourse history, and situational context.  Grad B suggested an initial focus on building a belief net with manually extracted features, using existing transcripts.  They also discussed the structure of the belief net, debating the need for intermediate nodes and how to handle combined intentions (e.g., wanting to both go to and learn about a location).  Grad B's opinion on the belief net structure was positive, believing it to be a suitable approach if the necessary input information could be obtained, and saw it as a platform for further linguistic analysis and integration with resources like FrameNet. The new form arrangement involved XML representation of user, situation, and decision nodes (like Go-there, Info-on, Location) for input to the belief net.\n",
    "Grad E and Grad A expressed concerns about the practical application of their theoretical framework for influencing decisions within a user model. Grad E questioned how to represent dynamic values like a user's budget, which constantly changes, within the discrete structure of a belief network.  They also struggled with representing complex user interests as a vector of hundreds of values, suggesting a \"fit\" node to measure compatibility between user interests and object features as a potential solution. Grad A questioned the relevance of certain inputs, like \"slurred\" and \"angry\" speech, advocating for focusing on strong influences. They also raised concerns about deriving features like indoor/outdoor activity from entity types, suggesting it might be more reliable to treat them as primitive features.  Both grads were concerned about the computational complexity and clarity of the model as the number of influences and connections increased. They discussed strategies like intermediate nodes and combining related influences to simplify the network and improve its interpretability.  Ultimately, they agreed on the need for further refinement and organization to ensure the model's feasibility and consistency.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) developer emphasized the importance of simplicity and ergonomics. They presented examples of existing remote controls, highlighting the negative user experience with overly complex designs. They advocated for a sleek, user-friendly interface with fewer buttons, suggesting that lost functionality could be compensated for with improved aesthetics and intuitive design.  They also proposed innovative features like glow-in-the-dark materials and a rechargeable station. The UI developer questioned the necessity of a touch screen, citing battery life concerns and questioning its compatibility with the desired organic shape. They suggested incorporating a small touch screen area while keeping the rest of the remote a different color. They also proposed using a rubbery material for better grip and durability.\n\nThe final decision was to design a plastic remote control with a simple, sleek aesthetic, prioritizing a younger demographic.  A touch screen with sub-menus for less-used functions was chosen, along with voice recognition for basic controls (on/off, volume, channels). A \"finder\" function, activated by voice command, was also incorporated to address the common problem of lost remotes.  Glow-in-the-dark material would be used as a trimming.  The team decided to explore cutting-edge battery technology to accommodate the touch screen's power requirements while remaining within the target cost of 12.50 Euros. The company's slogan and logo would be displayed during the boot-up sequence on the touch screen.  The team also discussed the possibility of interchangeable faceplates, but this was deferred for cost evaluation.\n",
    "The professor emphasizes the need to address additive noise more explicitly in their speech recognition system. He notes their current system primarily handles convolutional noise using RASTA-like filtering in the log domain, while spectral subtraction methods employed by others have shown promise in managing additive noise.  He suggests integrating spectral subtraction while retaining some of their existing techniques.\n\nThe professor discusses various spectral subtraction methods, including using histograms of speech segments to estimate signal and noise energies in each frequency band and simpler methods relying on periods of silence to determine the noise spectrum. He highlights the challenge of non-stationary noise, suggesting that while ideally noise estimation should consider future frames, most spectral subtraction implementations are more effective with slowly varying or stationary noise.  He also mentions advanced techniques like Hans-Guenter Hirsch's histogram-based approach and the use of a forgetting factor for online noise estimation.  The professor acknowledges the trade-off between estimation accuracy and the amount of speech data required, particularly with varying noise levels.  He notes common practices like using adaptive schemes and setting thresholds based on previous noise estimates. He also mentions the practical effectiveness of spectral subtraction in the magnitude domain, despite theoretical recommendations for the power domain.\n",
    "The group extensively discussed the remote control's function, focusing on balancing advanced features with user-friendliness.  They considered voice recognition, acknowledging its potential popularity, especially among younger demographics (15-35), but also expressing concerns about its feasibility and cost.  A key debate revolved around voice commands for channel selection: using channel numbers versus station names.  The latter, while user-friendly, raised concerns about accidental triggering by television advertisements.\n\nThe kinetic charging function, a \"sales gimmick,\" sparked interest.  The team envisioned a hybrid approach, combining kinetic energy with a backup battery to address concerns about inconsistent charging.  The kinetic function would power basic operations, while the battery would act as a reserve.\n\nRegarding the remote's physical form, the group favored a two-part, snowman-like shape for comfortable handling, with less frequently used buttons hidden within a foldable compartment.  A jog dial emerged as a preferred method for navigating channels and adjusting volume, offering quicker control than traditional buttons.  The team also explored incorporating a light, possibly activated by motion, for easier use in dark environments.  They debated the necessity of an LCD screen, ultimately questioning its value given the remote's intended simplicity.\n",
    "The team proposed a demographic marketing strategy focusing on a younger demographic (15-35 years old) due to their higher likelihood of purchasing trendy, technologically advanced products. This age group expressed interest in features like speech recognition, while older demographics showed less inclination to pay extra for such features.  The team decided to prioritize the look and feel of the remote, aiming for a \"fancy\" aesthetic to attract the target demographic.\n\nThere was agreement between Industrial Design and Marketing on the need for a visually appealing remote control.  Marketing emphasized the importance of a sleek, modern design that aligns with the company's corporate image (yellow and black with a prominent double \"R\" logo).  Industrial Design suggested incorporating the company's slogan, \"We put fashion in electronics,\" into the design.\n\nThe Industrial Designer proposed a wireless, infrared-based remote, prioritizing ease of use and a lower production cost compared to laser technology. They also suggested exploring options for a charging station to address the issue of lost remotes.  Marketing agreed with the focus on user-friendliness and a lower price point, emphasizing the need for a simple, intuitive interface to avoid user frustration, particularly with excessive buttons and complex functionalities.  They also highlighted the importance of addressing the common user complaint of losing remotes, suggesting a \"find me\" feature.  Marketing believed that a visually appealing, easy-to-use remote with a \"find me\" feature would be highly marketable.\n",
    "Grad G was concerned with how to capture subject intentions, especially given that most of the data consisted of questions rather than statements. The professor agreed that capturing intentions was important and suggested focusing on constructions within construction grammar.  Grad G also questioned the relevance of metaphorical language in questions.  The professor and PhD F provided examples of metaphorical use in questions. Grad G did not mention MSG or pronouncing zero. Grad G did not express an opinion on hiring Fey. The professor suggested involving Fey in drafting a recruitment note for study participants.\n",
    "The industrial designer's primary focus was on the user interface and physical design of the remote.  They advocated for a design that \"changes in size depending on user preference,\" suggesting inflatable or shrinkable materials. They also stressed the importance of durability (\"unbreakable,\" \"waterproof\"), a comfortable \"feel,\" and a clear indication of when the remote successfully sent a signal (an \"oral cue\").  While open to various materials, they hadn't settled on any specific options, seeking feedback from the team and clarification on the budget.\n\nRegarding speech recognition, the industrial designer believed it could be feasible if the user invested time in a training process. They also suggested wireless or solar recharging to address battery life concerns. They did not specifically address Bluetooth or other new technologies, but their focus on cost and established user preferences suggested a cautious approach to incorporating untested features.  Their emphasis on including a \"scroll wheel\" for channel selection indicates a preference for enhancing existing functionalities rather than introducing radically new interaction methods.\n",
    "Inspections, particularly in long-term care homes, were discussed extensively, prompted by reports from the Canadian Armed Forces. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders\u2019 positions on inspection priorities were not found in the provided transcripts.  The House of Commons' reopening was debated, with opposition parties advocating for a full reopening with complete powers.  The government defended the hybrid model, citing its inclusivity and the ability for broader participation.  The impact of the pandemic on Canada's diplomatic relations, specifically with China, was raised due to concerns about Huawei technology, the export of pathogens, and investment in Chinese development banks.\n\nAllocation of funds and addressing systematic racism were central themes.  While specific details of Justin Trudeau's elaboration on government funds and institutional revolution weren't found in these transcripts, the government defended its spending, highlighting programs like CEBA and CEWS, and emphasized its commitment to addressing systemic racism.  Concerns were raised about the impact of the carbon tax on farmers, the need for support for the forestry industry and summer camps, access to rural internet, the RCMP budget, and the treatment of indigenous communities.  The government responded by defending its programs and highlighting its commitment to various sectors and communities.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote control's design from technical and functional perspectives.  They agreed to focus on a user-friendly design that incorporates original and trendy elements while maintaining core functionalities.  Technically, the remote would utilize a chip to process user inputs from buttons and transmit infrared signals to the television. The team explored minimizing the number of buttons, potentially incorporating a menu-driven interface for less frequently used functions.  They also considered advanced features like voice recognition, particularly for younger demographics, but acknowledged potential challenges with implementation and cost.  A key design requirement was to maintain a balance between innovation and familiarity to avoid alienating users. The target demographic was identified as 15 to 35-year-olds, emphasizing sleek aesthetics and advanced features while keeping the price point affordable. The team planned to develop individual concepts for components, user interface, and market trends before reconvening to refine the design.\n",
    "The team discussed the design and functionalities of a new television remote control.  The industrial designer presented a prototype using infrared communication, batteries, and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for functionalities. They debated whether processing should occur on the remote or the television set, with the user interface designer suggesting the television for broader compatibility. Navigation options were explored, including on-screen navigation, a mouse-like device, voice control, and a \"find me\" feature. Marketing feedback emphasized user preferences for affordability, quality, and a speech interface, particularly for channel and volume control. Lighting adaptive options were deemed too complex for the current project. Teletext functionality and future internet access via television were also considered. The team ultimately decided to prioritize affordability, quality, and a speech interface for channel and volume control.  Future internet access via television was also discussed, with the industrial designer suggesting the remote be designed to accommodate this functionality later.\n",
    "PhD D reported that the first five EDU meetings had been processed and chunked for IBM.  There was discussion of sending IBM four more transcripts after confirmation from Brian.  Grad H discussed using THISL tools for information retrieval from meeting transcripts, explaining that the tools could index meetings and allow keyword search, returning relevant timeframes.  The results could be accessed via command line but grad H, possibly with Dave Gelbart's help, was considering a more user-friendly interface, potentially merging it with the Channeltrans interface.  They discussed THISL's ability to handle queries, different speakers, and long audio files.  Grad H also mentioned potential Windows porting challenges and the possibility of using FreeBSD.  PhD G suggested demonstrating prosody work, such as sentence and turn boundary detection, during the demo meeting.\n\nThe group discussed meeting data collection, with PhD F suggesting collecting data from regular meetings of the same group to allow for summarization research and analysis of utterance patterns and cues.  PhD D proposed collecting data from a wider variety of meetings for acoustic analysis.  Postdoc A and PhD D discussed the importance of native or fluent English speakers for language model building.  PhD C discussed using XML tools for data extraction and reformatting. Grad H was creating a tool to visually indicate microphone connection status.\n\nGrad H discussed disk backup with Dave Johnson, who recommended using both backup and manual archiving.  PhD D suggested recording digits at the end of meetings to save time.  PhD F suggested the possibility of inheriting IBM equipment and setting up a recording room elsewhere.  They also discussed giving participants a CD of the meeting recording.  Postdoc A raised anonymization concerns.  Grad H discussed disk space issues and archiving Broadcast News data.  They discussed PhD C's work on an automatic segmenter for classifying speech, overlap, and silence, using features and potentially clustering algorithms or neural networks.  PhD D suggested starting with a simpler signal and visualizing feature separation in two dimensions.  They discussed the use of close and distant microphones, and the potential use of beamforming with two microphones in a PDA.  The meeting concluded with a brief discussion of digit collection and anonymization procedures, with a decision to postpone detailed anonymization discussion until the next meeting.\n",
    "Ms. Jenny Kwan's concern over the \"gap between program development and its implementation\" pertains to the Welsh Government's rollout of the new national curriculum.  While Kirsty Williams, the Minister for Education, expresses enthusiasm for the curriculum's development and the teaching profession's willingness to engage with the changes, Ms. Kwan's statement highlights anxieties regarding the practical application of the ambitious framework.  The extensive feedback received during consultations revealed a desire for both simplification and greater depth in different areas, raising the question of how these potentially conflicting needs will be addressed in a consistent manner across all schools.  The Minister acknowledges the need for a balance between individual school autonomy and national expectations, particularly concerning progression.  The plan to legislate for \"what matters\" statements aims to address this, ensuring all schools cover essential concepts like mental health and wellbeing, while allowing flexibility in their approach.  However, concerns remain about whether classroom teachers share the same enthusiasm for the new curriculum as school leaders, and whether the available resources, professional development, and support systems will adequately equip them to implement it effectively, thus bridging the gap Ms. Kwan identifies.  The Minister acknowledges potential unintended consequences, such as increased segregation within schools, and emphasizes the importance of strong leadership, appropriate pedagogy, and attention to student well-being to mitigate these risks.  The delayed implementation to 2022 is intended to address these concerns and allow sufficient time for teacher training and resource development.  However,  challenges persist in ensuring consistent implementation across all schools, integrating teachers trained outside Wales, and providing ongoing support beyond the initial two-year funding period.\n",
    "The Project Manager felt the meetings were productive, especially compared to the first meeting. They believed the group successfully developed a remote with voice recognition, a non-remote-like shape, simple design features, and a slide-out bay for advanced functions. They were pleased the prototype included a visible light feature with multiple colors, interchangeable faces with a natural look, a spongy feel, and a rubber coating for durability. They also pointed out the voice recognition console on the back and the fact the television was edible. The Project Manager was concerned the prototype cost more than the target budget.\n\nThe Project Manager seemed happy with their presentation content, highlighting the on/off button, channel and volume buttons, slide-out panel, visible light feature, natural look, spongy feel, rubber coating, and voice recognition console. They also mentioned the edible television.\n\nThe group had a slightly different perspective than the Project Manager. They were disappointed about losing the solar panel feature due to budget constraints. They felt the pull-out panel could take some adjusting. They discussed alternative skins or covers for the remote. They also noted the prototype was over budget.\n\nThe transcripts do not contain any information about the group's thoughts on using a panther as a drawing.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's features.  They favored standard push-buttons for numerical input and essential functions (power, volume, channel) due to ease of use and cost-effectiveness, rejecting alternatives like scroll wheels or an over-reliance on an LCD screen.  While an LCD screen with a spinning wheel for menu navigation was initially considered for advanced features and a sleeker aesthetic, it was ultimately deemed less user-friendly and potentially more expensive.  The team prioritized a simple, intuitive interface for common functions.\n\nThe rubber casing, chosen for its anti-RSI properties and potential for kinetic energy harvesting, directly influenced button choices.  A double-curved, ergonomic design, though ideal for comfort, necessitated rubber push-buttons due to manufacturing constraints. This was accepted, aligning with the anti-RSI and \"spongy\" texture trends. The microphone's placement wasn't detailed, but voice recognition, initially favored, was removed due to cost concerns, potentially becoming a premium feature later.  The team felt the remote's distinctive look, combined with kinetic charging, would make it easy to find, mitigating the need for a beeper.\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted Canada's tourism sector, leading to closures of businesses and widespread job losses, especially in communities heavily reliant on tourism.  For example, Banff and Canmore experienced unemployment rates of 85% or higher. Seasonal businesses faced particular challenges as they generate most of their revenue during the peak season, which was significantly disrupted by the pandemic. These businesses often did not qualify for existing government support programs due to their unique revenue cycles.\n\nThe Canadian government implemented several measures to mitigate these impacts.  General programs like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the wage subsidy program aimed to provide financial support to workers and businesses. However, tourism-specific measures were slow to materialize, causing anxiety in the industry. While ad campaigns were launched, tourism businesses expressed a need for direct and timely financial aid.  The government eventually announced additional funding for regional development agencies, such as the Western Economic Diversification Fund, to provide support to tourism operators.  Additionally, the government extended the wage subsidy program until the end of August to assist tourism businesses in retaining their employees.  The government also acknowledged the need for further support and planned to announce additional measures in the coming days, although specifics were not yet available.\n",
    "The team presented three different concepts for the remote control. The Industrial Designer proposed a focus on component limitations, suggesting kinetic battery power, a choice of plastic, rubber, or titanium casing, and either basic buttons or a scroll wheel with an LCD screen.  The User Interface specialist suggested a two-part remote with a base station, two scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a locator device. The Marketing specialist emphasized current trends, recommending a fruit or vegetable theme and spongy feel.\n\nThe team discussed the design at length.  They considered various shapes, including a rectangular shape, a banana, and a capsicum, and debated the practicality and appeal of each. They also discussed the inclusion of an LCD screen, speech recognition, a locator device, and a turbo button.  They considered the target audience, cost limitations, and the importance of ergonomics.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on a banana-shaped remote with a kinetic battery power source and a plastic case with rubber grips. They opted for two scroll wheels, a turbo button, and a locator device, but decided against the LCD screen and speech recognition due to cost concerns. The prototype would not include a base station.  They agreed that the Marketing and User Interface specialists would collaborate on the prototype.\n",
    "The meetings did not discuss DARPA.  The main topic was the design of a new television remote control.  The team decided the remote should prioritize content selection over channel selection, allowing users to choose programs based on category or theme displayed on the TV screen rather than scrolling through channels.  The remote would use minimal buttons and rely on screen navigation.  The team also briefly discussed incorporating smart home features, such as light adaptation based on the program being watched, but this was not a primary focus.  No formal paper or statistics were presented.\n",
    "The group discussed several techniques for noise reduction and speech enhancement in the context of the Aurora task, including spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, signal subspace approaches, and vector Taylor series.  They explored combining these methods, such as using spectral subtraction followed by a KL transform and Wiener filtering, particularly for colored noise environments.  They also discussed the importance of accurate voice activity detection (VAD) for noise estimation and the potential benefits of training a neural network for VAD on a larger dataset like SpeechDat-Car.  The group also discussed the impact of different window sizes for mean calculations in noise reduction, noting the trade-off between performance and latency.  A key point was the challenge of applying these techniques to large vocabulary tasks like Wall Street Journal, as most research had focused on small vocabulary tasks.  Finally, they touched upon the use of frame dropping and its impact on performance, especially with the new endpoint information provided in the Aurora task.  There was no discussion of delays in the meetings.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts do not contain a discussion of \"triple R\" or \"triple RC\" product names.  Therefore, I cannot answer questions about their advantages or the marketing team's rationale for targeting young people.\n\nWhile the transcripts extensively discuss education in Wales, they do not mention a product or marketing strategies.  The discussions primarily focus on school performance, curriculum changes, funding challenges, teacher preparedness, and support systems for students, particularly those with additional learning needs or facing exclusion.  The transcripts also touch on topics like student well-being, mental health support, and the impact of poverty on educational outcomes.  There is no mention of selecting channels for marketing a product.\n",
    "The group discussed existing remotes and their shortcomings, noting the limited use of most buttons beyond power, volume, and channel selection.  Market research revealed user frustration with losing remotes and difficulty learning new ones. They explored a \"whistle-back\" function as a potential innovative feature.  There was debate about voice control, its feasibility given cost constraints, and potential interference from television audio.  They considered the target demographic, with younger users more receptive to voice control but potentially less likely to purchase due to budget limitations.  The team ultimately leaned towards a simpler design with essential buttons, a possible menu function, and the \"whistle-back\" feature as a key selling point.  The LCD screen was deemed too costly and complex.  A two-tone color scheme and materials like plastic and rubber were favored for the remote's casing. The importance of aligning with the company's existing color scheme and slogan was also emphasized.  The team concluded the need to finalize the remote's functions and features before the next meeting, prioritizing simplicity and speed to market.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM emphasized the importance of a phased return to school, prioritizing the safety and well-being of students and staff.  She stated that reopening would be guided by scientific and medical advice, with transparent communication to build confidence and allow planning time.  The principles she outlined would apply to further and higher education.  She stressed that reopening was not imminent and restrictions remained in place.\n\nBethan Owen's comments on the high-risk category were not mentioned in the provided transcripts.\n\nWilliams AM outlined five principles for school reopening: (1) safety and well-being of students and staff; (2) alignment with the broader Welsh Government pandemic response; (3) clear communication and planning time for parents and staff; (4) prioritizing specific groups of children for initial return; and (5) operationalizing the return with considerations for safety, staffing, social distancing, transport, and school gate gatherings.\n\nNew examinations and school qualifications were discussed in the context of cancelled exams due to the pandemic.  Williams AM explained that teachers would submit predicted grades, which would then be moderated to ensure fairness and robustness within the qualification system. A-level and GCSE result days would proceed as normal.  Vocational learners' assessments were also addressed, with some potential delays for technical qualifications requiring competency certificates.\n\nAddressing doubts about the sufficiency of government actions, Williams AM reiterated that restrictions were not being relaxed and reopening was not imminent. She emphasized the need for testing, tracing, and quarantine measures to be in place before any further reopening phases.  She also highlighted efforts to support vulnerable children at home, including risk assessments, multi-agency support, and regular check-ins.  Concerns about the attainment gap were acknowledged, with plans to address digital disadvantage and learning loss, especially for vulnerable children. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was also considered in ensuring equal access to learning.\n",
    "The team expressed several likes and dislikes regarding the production process.\n\n**Likes:**\n\n* **Rubber case material:** The team favored a rubber case for its durability, potential to prevent repetitive strain injuries, and \"funky\" feel.  The malleability of rubber also allowed for flexibility in design.\n* **Simple push-buttons:**  Simple push-buttons were preferred over more complex options like scroll wheels or LCD displays due to their lower cost and ease of use.\n* **Kinetic energy:**  The team liked the idea of a kinetic energy source, possibly generated by squeezing the rubber case, as a novel and environmentally friendly feature.\n* **Voice recognition:**  Voice recognition technology was considered a cutting-edge feature that could set their remote apart from competitors.\n* **Multiple color options:** Offering the remote in a variety of colors was seen as a way to give customers more control and appeal to different demographics.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n* **High cost of some components:**  The team initially considered solar cells and a backup battery, but these were deemed too expensive.  Similarly, advanced chips and sample sensors were rejected due to cost concerns.\n* **Limited functionality of sample sensor:** The sample sensor's speech recognition capabilities were considered too limited to be useful for a TV remote.\n* **Touch screen:** A touch screen was rejected due to concerns about cost and potential to exacerbate repetitive strain injuries.\n* **Overly gimmicky features:** The team wanted to avoid making the remote too gimmicky, fearing it would deter customers.  They expressed concerns about striking the right balance between innovation and functionality.\n* **Lack of clarity regarding the \"look and feel\":** While the team agreed that the remote should look \"slick\" and \"funky,\" there was some disagreement about what those terms meant in practice.  The final design was left somewhat open-ended.\n",
    "Discussions regarding mean subtraction primarily focused on its impact within the SRI recognition system, particularly concerning channel normalization and reverberation effects.  One participant, grad e, observed improved word error rates on far-mike data using mean subtraction with the PZM microphone, but a degradation in near-mike performance.  This contrasted with improved near-mike performance observed using HTK, which doesn't perform channel adaptation like the SRI system.  It was suggested that the SRI system's mean subtraction approach already handles channel normalization, potentially negating the benefit observed with HTK.  Further, the re-synthesized audio used exhibited echo-like artifacts, potentially impacting training by misaligning phones.  Professor b suggested filtering techniques, similar to those used by Hirsch and Avendano, to mitigate reverberation effects and address low-energy sections where these artifacts are prominent.  There was additional discussion on the impact of mean subtraction on signal loudness and signal-to-noise ratio, with some debate about the expected effects of mean subtraction on signal amplitude.  A theory was proposed that the mean subtraction process within the SRI system implicitly performs a form of gain control, improving signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enhancing performance.  The discussion also touched on the potential influence of table hits or other transient noises on the mean normalization process, potentially leading to a better signal-to-noise ratio.  Finally, the participants briefly discussed the interaction of mean subtraction with other techniques like VTL normalization and MLLR transformations, and the potential benefits of testing the SRI system on noisy TI-digits data.\n",
    "The group discussed several Aurora-related topics, including mixed signals, VAD improvements and results, alternative methods for increasing space, opinions of postdoc A on the new headphones, and the deadline.\n\nOne issue with the mixed signals was identifying and correcting errors in the time boundaries.  Using mixed signals made it harder to locate errors and the interface was slow to load individual waveforms, making it impractical to switch between views.  Suggestions included improving the interface, preloading channels, or using a separate window for each channel. They decided to have transcribers mark speech and non-speech segments, possibly using \u201cX\u201d to represent noise or other sounds.  This approach aimed for consistency with the automatic system and better forced alignment.  They also discussed the challenge of short segments being missed by the automatic segmentation and the difficulty in inserting or deleting them.\n\nRegarding VAD, the French VAD was noted to perform better than others, particularly the small VAD.  Mean normalization before VAD was suggested as a potential improvement.  Spectral subtraction was also discussed, with concerns about increased variance and incompatibility with online normalization.  A potential solution was layering spectral subtraction and online normalization.  Additionally, using features beyond spectral envelopes, such as fine-structure-based features related to harmonicity, was proposed.\n\nPostdoc A found the new headphones comfortable, but others experienced fit issues, particularly with head movement.  The position of the backstrap and adjusting the headphones were suggested as solutions.\n\nThe deadline for the next Aurora meeting was in June.  A Eurospeech special session on Aurora had a deadline of May 13th.  The group considered various options for a Eurospeech submission, including digits, but were unsure about the feasibility given the time constraints.  Finally, they discussed the challenge of insufficient data for the new task and the potential of adapting data from other sources, such as Broadcast News, based on a paper presented at a recent conference.\n",
    "Special schools were not specifically addressed in the provided transcripts in relation to the new purpose arrangement.  However, the transcripts do discuss the role of schools in utilizing the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for looked-after children compared to the regional consortia.  The PDG for looked-after children is managed at the regional level by consortia, who allocate the funding.  This approach aims for a more strategic use of resources and to address challenges posed by the frequent movement of looked-after children between schools.  Historically, funds allocated directly to schools were sometimes lost when a child transferred.  The regional consortia, using input from regional looked-after children PDG coordinators, deploy the PDG in various ways, including individual school allocations, capacity building (such as training on attachment disorder) and school-to-school best practice sharing.  The transcripts also mention an external evaluation of the PDG's impact on looked-after children, commissioned to assess its effectiveness and to inform future improvements. While special schools were mentioned briefly as generally performing well, their specific role in relation to the PDG and regional consortia was not detailed in these transcripts.\n",
    "The User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager introduced a prototype remote control by analyzing existing remote controls, discussing their pros and cons, and brainstorming desired features for a new design.

    "Dafydd Evans, Kay Martin, and Nick Brazil, representing ColegauCymru, believe that the Welsh baccalaureate, while having a laudable initial vision, has lost its way and is not effectively preparing learners for employment.  Evans states that employers, parents, and students do not understand the qualification, preferring the term \"skills challenge certificate.\" He suggests a review incorporating employer input to emphasize employability and entrepreneurial skills.  Martin concurs, noting that employers prioritize core subject qualifications and skills. She cites successful employer engagement programs like Career Ready, which provide mentorships and internships, as more effective than the Welsh bac. Brazil adds that few employers specifically request the Welsh bac and questions its development of necessary job skills. He agrees with Martin that existing programs may be more effective.  All three express concern that the current Welsh bac has become overly rigorous and bureaucratic, prioritizing outcomes over skill development. Brazil and Martin question the need for the Welsh bac given the success of other programs and suggest a return to its original vision. They acknowledge funding structures incentivize qualifications over skills, contributing to the current issues.\n",
    "The team explored several design options for the remote.  For power, they considered batteries, a hand dynamo, kinetic energy, and solar cells, ultimately deciding on kinetic energy through squeezing the remote.  For the casing, options included plastic, latex, rubber, wood, and titanium.  They chose a double-curved rubber case for its anti-RSI qualities and ability to withstand being thrown.  This choice necessitated rubber push-buttons.  Simple push-buttons were preferred for cost reasons over scroll wheels or LCD options. A standard chip was chosen over a chip-on-print for cost savings.  The sample sensor/speaker and speech recognition features were deemed too expensive and impractical.  The final design includes power, channel, and volume buttons, a numerical keypad, and potentially a lock button.  Marketing suggested bright colors and a customizable exterior to enhance appeal and differentiate the product.  The kinetic charging combined with the durable, squeezable rubber was identified as a key selling point.  The final look and feel of the remote remained to be decided, though \u201cslick\u201d and \u201cfunky\u201d were suggested directions.\n",
    "The Project Manager expressed a clear preference for the solar battery route to align with the company's environmentally friendly image, but acknowledged the potential need for a small backup battery due to the limitations of solar power. They also favored incorporating visible light signaling as a unique feature and offering a variety of case materials to cater to different preferences.  They questioned the feasibility of producing the remote in different case materials and proposed market piloting to gauge reception before a full launch.  The Project Manager championed the touch screen as the main selling point due to its novelty and presence in other tech devices, but acknowledged cost concerns. They also liked the voice recognition feature and considered it a strong selling point alongside the casing.  They were open to exploring a smaller touch screen to manage costs and favored retaining voice recognition, even if it meant increased production costs.  They were willing to consider reducing profit margins or increasing the selling price to accommodate the higher production costs associated with the touch screen and voice recognition. The Project Manager also suggested a non-traditional, possibly ovoid, shape for the remote, envisioning it as something aesthetically pleasing that could sit on a coffee table.  They proposed a simple design with a focus on the charging dock and durability, emphasizing tactile features like a slightly squishy, rubberized casing.  They also favored basic functionality, prioritizing essential features like power, volume, and channel controls, and suggested a dropdown or side menu for additional options. They tasked the industrial designer with developing the basic look and feel of the remote and the user interface designer with figuring out the layout incorporating voice recognition and simplified menu options.  Finally, they confirmed the decision to offer multiple case colors while sticking with the same basic non-remote design. They also revisited the idea of a scroll wheel, expressing a personal preference against it due to cost and usability concerns, and questioned its necessity given the presence of voice recognition and the charging dock. They were open to the possibility of a scroll wheel if it offered significant added value, but ultimately prioritized the dock and a simple button layout.  The primary concern for the next meeting was determining the specifics of the casing, buttons, and overall user interface, along with associated costs.\n",
    "User Interface believed the scroll-wheels could be implemented with a regular chip and not the more expensive advanced chip.  They also felt the scroll-wheels and speaker were necessary additions for the remote.  They expressed concern about the cost of the LCD screen, especially since TVs already display channel and volume information.  User Interface also questioned the durability of rubber buttons, pointing out that printed symbols might wear off.  Finally, they believed the remote should be made of plastic with a rubber covering for grip and have interchangeable covers in a variety of colors.\n",
