    " The discussion about the issues with HMRC centres around the complexities of implementing a Welsh-language standard for the childcare offer. Julie Morgan notes that HMRC would have been able to process applications and handle queries bilingually, but there were issues with the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use. She indicates that the main reason for changing the approach was to achieve a more flexible and expanded offer, rather than difficulties with the Welsh language standards. Despite assurances from the previous Minister that HMRC would not have any problems with delivering according to the Welsh language standards, the current Minister acknowledges that technical reasons played a significant role in the decision to abandon the HMRC route. The committee expresses frustration about the situation, highlighting that time and resources have been wasted due to the incorrect assumption that HMRC would be unable to accommodate the Welsh language standards. Julie Morgan apologizes for any confusion caused and explains that the decision was ultimately driven by a desire for a more flexible and expanded offer, which would have been restricted by the HMRC route.  (Word Count: 316) <doc-sep> Can I welcome you all back to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health.
