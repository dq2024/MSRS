    "The group discussed potential changes to their data collection methods for IBM computers and data collection participants. Grad C suggested slightly altering tasks to ensure data for every decision node and explicitly building decisions into the data collection. Professor D suggested to simplify the data gathering by focusing on a confined set of things to accomplish.\n\nRegarding English usage, Professor D acknowledged concerns about the constructions people use, particularly in relation to different places (museum vs. university). He suggested that the dialogues could be structured to influence the language used. He also mentioned that they could get by with the middle column of decisions, which would be feasible to build belief-nets that would do that.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in influencing decision-making within their system. They specifically examined how these models could inform a decision about whether a user intends to \"enter,\" \"view,\" or \"tango\" (approach closely) a landmark.\n\nRegarding the user budget, they considered it as a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various decisions. The user's financial policy (cheap, average, or spendy) and running budget (amount of money they have left to spend) were identified as factors influencing decisions. They discussed the need to update the budget externally to the belief net, as it changes with user actions. They also debated whether belief propagation should occur every time the budget is updated or only when needed.\n",
    "During the meetings, there was a significant discussion about the uncertainty surrounding the Canadian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's response. Cathy McLeod criticized the government for a lack of transparency and for not providing an economic update, highlighting the struggles of the forestry industry and the drop in government revenues. Mona Fortier acknowledged the economic uncertainty but defended the government's actions, pointing to measures taken to support Canadians, workers, and businesses, and reporting bi-weekly to Parliament on the status of these measures. Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned whether the Liberal Party was in financial difficulty and benefiting from emergency programs, suggesting that the criteria for accessing these programs may be poorly designed. He also demanded that the government present an economic update before June 17.\n",
    "The industrial manager, William, considered several characteristics of the tiger for the remote control's product design. Although not explicitly stated, these characteristics can be inferred from the discussion. The first characteristic is the tiger's organic shape. The team considered organic shapes inspired by fruits and vegetables for the remote, as they were trendy in fashion. The second is a rubber, anti-stress feel. The team considered rubber for the buttons, similar to what is used in stress ball manufacturing. The third characteristic is vibrant color. The team considered fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber cover. The last characteristic is \"something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway.\"\n",
    "The team discussed the \"Transcriber\" tool, a French group's software with a Tcl-TK user interface, for converting audio to text. While generally effective, it had limitations, particularly in representing overlaps in speech due to interface constraints. One team member mentioned that the tool did not have the ability to automatically identify the channel the speaker was on, which made disentangling the different speakers difficult.\n\nTo address these limitations, suggestions included modifying the interface to better represent overlaps, possibly using a musical score notation, or exploring alternative tools. One team member mentioned that they knew of a tool used to transcribe eight channels simultaneously. There was also a suggestion to wire a speech recognizer to the tool to speed up the transcription process.\n",
    "The presentations covered a range of topics related to the design and market considerations for a new remote control.\n\n**Components Design, Properties, and Materials:** The team discussed the internal components, including the circuit board, chip, and battery. The case material options were plastic, rubber, and titanium, with rubber offering the potential for a spongy feel, aligning with current fashion trends. A kinetic battery was favored, and push buttons aligned with a simple chip.\n\n**Market Findings and Trend Watching:** Market research indicated a shift towards fancy look-and-feel designs, with fruits and vegetables and a spongy texture being key fashion trends.\n\n**User Interface and Interface Contents:** The interface design focused on simplicity and ease of use, with a limited number of buttons and an on-screen menu display for advanced functions. An iPod-style scroll wheel was considered but ultimately rejected due to cost and complexity. The team emphasized the importance of clear and intuitive button labels and avoiding ambiguity in the interface.\n\n**Remote Components:** The team explored the possibility of interchangeable components, such as fruit-shaped covers, to personalize the remote.",
    "The discussion focused on how data collection could be enhanced to improve user interface design, particularly for querying.\n\nKey points included:\n\n*   **Note-Taking and Summaries:** The potential of using note-taking, especially with tools like CrossPads, to automatically generate summaries was explored. However, concerns were raised about the quality of handwriting recognition and the potential for increased workload on participants.\n*   **Generating Queries:** The challenge of generating useful queries for the system was a central theme. Ideas included using keywords (\"action item\"), analyzing word frequency in summaries, and asking experts to listen to meetings and suggest potential queries.\n*   **Capturing Context:** The importance of capturing contextual information, such as spatial positioning of participants and content on whiteboards, was highlighted. This could be achieved through simple methods like taking digital photos or Polaroids.\n*   **Balancing Detail and Burden:** The need to balance the desire for detailed data with the burden on participants was a recurring concern. The group aimed to avoid requiring additional tasks that participants wouldn't normally do in a meeting.\n*   **Learning from Existing Systems:** The group touched on learning from note-taking applications and systems used by other groups.\n\nThe discussion emphasized a pilot approach, experimenting with different methods to determine what data collection techniques would be most effective and practical for improving the Meeting Recorder's user interface.",
    "The Project Manager emphasized speech recognition over buttons for the remote control's user interface, suggesting few buttons only for essential functions. Cost constraints were a concern, especially with custom-designed chips needed for voice activation. The Project Manager noted the voice technology isn't highly developed and that custom design chips will be more expensive. The incorporation of an LCD was considered for feedback, but its necessity was questioned given that feedback could come through the television itself. Button design was aimed for simplicity and reliability, with push-buttons being the company's expertise. The Project Manager agreed the remote needs to be technologically innovative, and that efforts to water that down should be resisted.\n",
    "The team discussed recording conventions, particularly regarding microphone usage. There was a push for standardization, with a preference for close-talking, head-mounted microphones to ensure consistent audio quality across speakers. The team explored purchasing additional wireless microphones, but also acknowledged the value of the existing wired setup. They also discussed potential problems with the Jimlets.\n\nThe team also considered incorporating video recordings in the future. While there was interest, concerns were raised about infrastructure requirements, human subject considerations, and the lack of dedicated personnel to manage video data. While the team acknowledged that video could be valuable, particularly for dialogue analysis, they decided to focus on optimizing the audio recordings for the time being, and to explore the possibility of collaborating with other institutions, such as NIST or LDC, that have the resources and expertise to handle video data collection.\n",
    "The discussion on project finance centered around keeping production costs under 12.50 Euros. The team explored various design choices and their cost implications, such as using a simple chip, kinetic energy, a single-curved case, special materials (rubber, wood, titanium), and special colors for buttons. They initially aimed for a flashy design with fruity colors but considered offering a more sophisticated look as an extra feature for older customers. The team also evaluated the prototype against criteria like fanciness and technical innovation, adjusting features to balance cost and appeal.\n\nThe use of the SMARTboard and digital pens was discussed. The team found the SMARTboard pen to be slow, imprecise, and not user-friendly, making it difficult to draw and write quickly. While the SMARTboard was seen as better than flip-overs for saving work, it lacked functionalities like predefined shapes and a voting mechanism. Some team members preferred writing on paper and scanning it, finding it faster and more natural. Overall, the SMARTboard's concept was considered okay but in need of improvement in speed and user-friendliness.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer focused on the physical aspects of the remote control, considering materials, shapes, and button designs. They explored options like rubber for a \"spongy feel\" and different casing materials, while also weighing design restrictions and the availability of components. The Industrial Designer showed a willingness to adapt to cost constraints, suggesting trade-offs like removing the curve and color.\n\nThe Project Manager prioritized functionality, cost-effectiveness, and market trends. They emphasized the importance of technological innovation and a fancy look, but also stressed the need to stay within budget. The Project Manager was responsible for making final decisions, such as scrapping speech recognition to reduce production costs.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that custom covers were the best solution for design and functionality within budget. They also decided to keep the rubber material for durability and its unique feel. Additionally, the Project Manager opted for a long-term battery source for simplicity and a custom chip to enable technological innovation.\n",
    "The team's decision-making process regarding the remote's base involved evaluating the fashionability and functionality of different case materials and shapes. They considered plastic, wood, latex, titanium, and rubber. They leaned towards a curved case, though the exact shape (single or double-curved) was unclear. They discussed the pros and cons of each material, with latex being favored for its spongy feel (aligning with fashion trends) but also raising concerns about protecting the internal components.\n\nRegarding existing remotes, the team felt that current remote controls were ugly and had too many buttons that people didn't use. They were looking for a trendy, instantly recognizable design that would make people want to buy everything else from Real Reaction. They also wanted a long-lasting battery that would be guaranteed for the life of the product.",
    "The group discussed making an environmentally-friendly remote using a spongy material, which is a current trend, and explored potential materials like plastic, rubber, and titanium. An LCD screen was considered but ultimately dismissed due to cost and coherence with the design. Color options, including fruit and vegetable-inspired hues, were debated for their trendiness and appeal to the younger target group, with concerns about overdoing it. The discussion touched on the material and function issue, emphasizing the need for a balance between a sturdy design and a soft, spongy feel. The questionnaire would focus on design preferences.",
    "The Project Manager, User Interface, and Industrial Designer introduced a remote control prototype. They presented two versions, one with an LCD and one without, citing cost concerns related to the LCD. The industrial designer explained the prototype's features, including a joystick-like button for 360-degree movement, a microphone for speech recognition, and a switch to control the speech recognition system.\n\nThe group discussed the merits of multi-functional versus single-functional products, with the Project Manager emphasizing simplicity and ease of use. The User Interface designer suggested a modular approach, allowing users to add or remove functions as desired. The Marketing Manager highlighted the importance of a fancy look and feel, drawing inspiration from fruit and vegetable shapes and spongy materials.\n\nThe technological aspect received lower grades due to the use of pushbuttons instead of more innovative features like an LCD screen or a fancy chip. The lack of a locator feature was also noted. Although the speech recognition system could serve as a locator, there was no alternative if the system was disabled.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C had a discussion regarding the use of energy to detect overlapping speech. PhD A suggested that they should start with simple, easily interpretable methods before moving on to more complex analyses like scatter plots and derivatives. PhD C agreed that it would be more graphic to show the distribution of the data.\n\nPhD C also mentioned observing instances where a speaker was talking alone with high energy, followed by an overlapping zone with less energy, contrary to what was expected. PhD D suggested focusing on individual speakers and their overlaps to identify patterns that might be obscured by the variety of speaker combinations.\n\nThe discussion with Jose involved his work on detecting overlapping zones in speech recordings. He had been transcribing the first session and found a thousand acoustic events, including overlaps, breaths, and other non-speech sounds. He expressed interest in studying these acoustic events to find parameters for detecting overlaps and distinguishing them from other sounds.\n\nOverlaps created difficulties and problems because of the need to manually mark speaker overlaps. Initially, Jose was marking all acoustic events, including speaker overlaps, nonspeech sounds, and silences. There was a concern about the time-consuming nature of the manual marking process. Professor E suggested that Jose focus solely on marking speaker overlaps to speed up the process. PhD C proposed an alternative approach, suggesting that speaker overlaps could be inferred from the relative energy in the close-talking microphones.\n",
    "The discussion on latency centered around reducing the overall processing delay in the system to meet a target of 250 milliseconds, or ideally, even lower, around 30-40 milliseconds. The team explored various optimizations, including redesigning LDA filters using recursive filters (IIR) and improving downsampling techniques.\n\nProfessor C's issue stemmed from the fact that despite improvements to the LDA filters, other processes, such as online normalization and neural net processing, introduced significant delays. The professor emphasized the need for better communication within the team to avoid redundancy and ensure that all members were aligned on the latency goals. The professor also argued that trading latency for performance was a better decision than reducing latency to 40-50 milliseconds, which would require throwing out most of their system.\n\nThe team estimated the total latency to be around 240 milliseconds after the discussed improvements, but there was concern about staying within the allowable limit, especially considering that some proposals had much lower latency targets.\n\nSpecific latency durations mentioned include:\n\n*   64 milliseconds for the low-frequency band IIR filter.\n*   11 milliseconds for the high-frequency band IIR filter.\n*   10 milliseconds for the additional downsampling filter.\n*   85 milliseconds for online normalization.\n*   80 milliseconds for the neural net and PCA.\n*   220 milliseconds for the VAD.\n*   50 milliseconds for delta and double-delta.",
    "The User Interface design introduced several key features and advantages for the prototype. The remote control was designed to be modular, allowing users to add or remove functions based on their needs and budget. For example, the LCD screen, speech recognition, and parental control features were optional add-ons.\n\nThe design also focused on simplicity and power, offering fewer buttons while retaining the same functionalities as remotes with many buttons. This was achieved through innovations like a single button that could move in 360 degrees and perform multiple actions like click, double-click, and swing.\n\nAdditional advantages included a robust design with materials like titanium, an endurable battery life with replaceable AA batteries, and a misplacement reminder feature that prompted users to return the remote to its charger. The design also incorporated programmable channels and vocabulary, allowing users to customize the device to their preferences.\n",
    "The prototype presentation covered two versions of a new remote control. The first prototype was gunmetal gray plastic that lights up when any button is pressed, with a concave curvature on the bottom for ergonomics. It featured a thumb-shaped design for the menu and mute buttons, numbers, and black labeling on top. There was some difficulty incorporating a fruit cover.\n\nThe second prototype was made of wood with a customizable color achieved through staining. It included an ergonomic shape, an on/off button, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, and an LCD screen on a flip panel. The microphone was placed on the top, under the flip. The presenter team also considered customer feedback, product evaluation, and redesign turnaround time. ",
    "The group had several discussions regarding the product's features. They initially planned for a touch screen but also explored bare PCB circuit boards and LCD screens as alternatives, considering cost and design limitations. They also considered rubber buttons with anti-RSI properties, aiming for a balance between functionality and a fancy look.\n\nRegarding the flip screen, the group considered a flip-top design with an LCD display on the top side and rubberized buttons on the bottom. The battery was a significant concern. Rechargeable options were unavailable, and standard batteries were considered too bulky. Dynamo charging was deemed impractical, while solar charging raised questions about compatibility with standard batteries and durability. Kinetic charging, similar to that in wristwatches, was explored as a potentially viable option.\n\nBudget limitations heavily influenced these discussions, forcing compromises on features like voice recognition and the locator function. The group aimed to balance innovation with cost-effectiveness, often sacrificing desired functionalities to meet budgetary constraints. The ultimate goal was to create a trendy, technologically innovative remote control that was also easy to use, all while staying within budget.\n",
    "The Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru. Estyn's engagement with the program showed that it was not wildly successful, but it did identify that some secondary schools have challenges and need support and resources. There were improvements overall for the 40 schools, but the improvement was limited for the amount of money spent. Estyn also noted that the variability in the success of the program occurred when all the people involved worked together effectively. Estyn met with the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers termly, and the challenge for the program was that it was introduced when regional consortia were beginning.",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes that Brexit has had an impact on Wales' higher education system. He notes that applications from EU students to Welsh institutions decreased by 8% based on UCAS data. This contrasts with a 2% increase for English institutions. He attributes this drop to two main factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to find the full fee, and the relative levels of investment in facilities, particularly buildings and equipment, between Wales and England.\n\nDespite these challenges, Dr. Blaney highlights the 'Study in Wales' program, a collective effort to promote Wales as a desirable study destination. He emphasizes Wales' relative safety and supportive environment as key selling points. He believes that the UK degree's strength and brand are available in Wales, but in a way that is safer and more supportive.\n",
    "The domains in the mental spaces are Situation, User, Discourse, and Ontology (SUDO). These domains provide input to a Bayes net, which is the EDU (Elicitation of Discourse Understanding). The middle layer would function by having features extracted from the communication, such as prosody, discourse, and verb choice. These features then point to hidden variables, such as whether someone is on a tour, running an errand, or in a hurry. The middle layer aims to figure out the abstract idea the person is trying to communicate, like \"I am a tourist, I want to go to this place.\" The hidden variables probabilistically depend on the extracted features. The goal is to keep extracted features from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the user's intent.\n",
    "The professor showed a keen interest in the back-end and data storage, particularly in the context of Andreas's work on content management systems. He highlighted the limitations of current systems, which assume a shared interpretation of keywords and taxonomies. The professor was interested in having a formalized way of writing down the context in which a sentence is uttered, to improve the quality of search results.\n\nThe professor also touched on the scalability of such systems, noting that while it's easy to hack up a system quickly in a small domain, the real challenge lies in combining knowledge from very different sources. He was also looking into a probabilistic approach, given the fuzzy nature of document retrieval. The professor mentioned that depending on which rules and ontologies are used, very different results can be obtained, suggesting a peer-to-peer approach where individuals carry around their \"individual bookshelves.\"\n",
    "The transcripts reveal significant discussion around several key issues. Regarding seniors care, the meetings highlight the disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care homes and the appalling conditions witnessed by the Canadian Armed Forces. There's a call for national standards of care, similar to those in the Canada Health Act, and for removing profit from long-term care.\n\nThe issue of racism, particularly anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, is also prominent. Speakers acknowledge systemic racism in Canada and call for concrete actions like ending racial profiling, over-policing, and over-incarceration. There's also a focus on the need for race-based data to inform better decision-making and ensure equitable access to education and health resources.\n\nThe meeting includes discussion on amendments to policies, with the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay encouraged veterans and their families to participate in the public debate about policies and programs affecting them. The Minister stated the government is always open to feedback on compensation for veterans.\n\nThere was no mention of the Minister of Seniors' statement on pandemic assistance for seniors.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer had disagreements about the remote control design due to differing priorities and expertise. Marketing emphasized user preferences, gathered through surveys, focusing on aesthetics (color, shape, style) and ease of use (prominent \"zap\" button, minimal unused buttons). The Industrial Designer focused on technical feasibility, component costs, and ergonomic considerations, sometimes clashing with Marketing's desire for advanced features like speech recognition and LCD screens due to budget constraints. The Project Manager tried to mediate between these conflicting viewpoints, while also adhering to new project requirements from upper management. Essentially, the disagreements stemmed from balancing user desires, technical limitations, and cost considerations within the project scope.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation criteria based on user requirements and current market trends discussed in previous meetings. The specific criteria they brought forward included:\n\n*   **Fancy Look and Feel:** The aesthetic appeal of the product.\n*   **Technologically Innovative:** Incorporating the latest technology.\n*   **Easy to Use:** User-friendly design.\n*   **Fashionable:** Aligned with current fashion trends.\n*   **Easy to Find in a Room:** Design consideration for practicality.\n*   **Robust:** Durable and reliable construction, often related to the materials used (e.g., rubber).\n\nThe evaluation used a seven-point scale to rate the product against these criteria, with higher scores indicating better performance. The team then discussed and agreed upon individual ratings for each criterion to determine the overall product evaluation.\n",
    "The transcription status is that eleven hours of meeting recordings are expected to be transcribed by the end of the month. The current interface is seen as functional and is being used by skilled transcribers. A musical score notation has been suggested as a possible method of denoting overlaps. There is a desire to encode overlaps more thoroughly, which has spurred discussion on how to expand the current interface or find other tools that can do so.\n\nRegarding the SPG schema, there's discussion on database formats to link word transcripts and annotations, considering factors like time marks, forced alignments, and recognition output. The NIST ATLAS is being considered as a standard, but there are concerns about its complexity and whether it's the best fit for their specific needs. There is discussion on how to represent multiple speakers and hierarchical relationships between utterances and words within the SPG schema.",
    "In the meeting transcript provided, the Deputy Minister, Julie Morgan AM, addressed her amendments related to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill in the following ways:\n\n**Duty to Promote Public Awareness:** The Deputy Minister emphasized the importance of raising public awareness about the change in the law and the prohibition of physical punishment. She highlighted that amendments 1 and 4 were in response to a committee recommendation. While acknowledging the need for a comprehensive campaign, she resisted amendments that specified particular groups or topics to be covered, arguing that this could unnecessarily constrain the campaign's scope and create an imbalance.\n\n**Duty to Report on the Effect of the Legislation:** The Deputy Minister supported the post-implementation review of the Bill's effect, stating that amendment 2 was influenced by a committee recommendation. She explained that the review would be a continuous program, including attitudinal surveys and data collection. She opposed amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign before section 1 commences, citing the need for certainty on the commencement date.\n\n**Regulation-Making Powers:** The Deputy Minister did not directly address regulation-making powers in the provided transcript.\n",
    "The discussion on long-term trends focused on the need for adequate timelines for reforms to allow for system readiness, particularly in light of the new curriculum. Philip Blaker emphasized the importance of Qualifications Wales maintaining standards and ensuring fair grading, especially during periods of change. He mentioned the use of comparable outcomes to ensure consistency in grading.\n\nBlaker described Qualification Wales's role as regulating awarding bodies and focusing on qualification design and assessment delivery. They approve specifications and sample assessment materials to ensure teachers understand expectations. He also mentioned that Qualifications Wales convenes interested parties to discuss resource availability and address gaps.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of exams, Gareth Pierce attributed the issue to three series of reforms with short timetables. He suggested a need for 18 months to two years from completing a specification to working with teachers and publishers. Blaker added that divergence from England's GCSE and A-level reforms provides Wales more agency in setting timelines.\n",
    "The discussion on challenges to implementing good practice across all parts of Wales highlighted inconsistencies in early childhood education and care provision. Historically, different local authorities have adopted varying patterns of providing early education, with some offering more than the minimum 10 hours of foundation phase for three and four-year-olds. This has resulted in a different landscape across Wales, determined by local authority decisions.\n\nThe geographically targeted Flying Start program, based on income benefit data, further contributes to this variance. The Welsh Government aims to develop facilities in each local authority to address the needs of families and children in those areas. However, concerns were raised about cuts in expenditure for the foundation phase and the potential impact on standards due to fewer teaching assistants.\n\nThe Welsh Government intends to develop a more integrated approach across all settings, with Estyn and CIW continuing to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards. They are also working to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to support the sector and meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales.\n",
    "The discussion focused on actual components, case materials, and interface design. The project manager discussed the design of actual components and the availability of materials in stock, emphasizing the importance of easy-to-find buttons for activating TV functions.\n\nRegarding case materials, the factory offered plastic as the main case housing, allowing for curved shapes, while titanium was limited to standard box shapes. The team considered wood and rubber, with rubber being of interest due to the current trend of a spongy feel. There was a suggestion of using rubber covers over a plastic mold to provide both the desired feel and the ability to change the color or design easily. The team also discussed a touch screen option.\n\nThe interface design involved considering button types and arrangements. It was suggested to have standard buttons on the top and more complex buttons underneath a flip-top design. Other ideas included a GUI interface with icons or touchpads, and a combination of rubber buttons for frequently used functions. The team ultimately decided on an LCD display on the top side of the flip top and rubberized buttons on the bottom side.",
    "Professor A expresses a few thoughts on the final model, particularly regarding the digits recorded in the meeting environment versus the TI-digits database. The professor finds it interesting that the digits recorded in the meeting environment have a 3.4% error rate compared to the 0.8% error rate for the original TI-digits database. The professor suggests that the TI-digits database is very clean and like a studio recording, whereas the meeting environment recordings are more realistic with background noise.\n\nThe discussion also touched on reverberation, with Grad B mentioning Avendano's work on dealing with reverberation by using longer time windows to encompass the reverberation effects. This involves trading spectral resolution for time resolution.\n\nRegarding pronouncing \"zero,\" it was noted that the digits are sometimes read as \"O\" and sometimes as \"zero.\" In past digit recognition tasks, both pronunciations were used.\n",
    "The group decided the remote control would be television only, with the slogan \"We put fashion in electronics\". The design would use plastic instead of metal due to potential interference and safety concerns.\n\nThe group agreed to aim for a simpler remote with fewer functions, and user testing revealed that most people primarily use remotes for changing channels, volume, and turning the TV on/off. Voice recognition was considered for basic controls and a paging system to locate the remote. They discussed balancing simplicity with advanced features like voice control, potentially making it an option for younger users while older users could use traditional buttons.\n\nA touch screen with submenus was considered, but cost and battery life were concerns. The group decided to focus on a younger demographic and create a sleek, simple remote with available advanced features. They provisionally agreed on a plastic-cased touch screen model with basic functions, voice recognition, and a paging system. The group also discussed custom chips and long-lasting batteries and agreed to interchangeable cases to change the fashion.\n",
    "The group discussed the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and young people. Vaughan Gething acknowledged the lack of a full assessment due to limited contact with families but assured that mental health and well-being are a priority. He mentioned a commissioned review, conducted with the delivery unit, to work with the national advisory group to review current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because of concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. He stated that crisis care services remain available.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Gething highlighted efforts to maintain consistent support for women across Wales, adapting services for phone or online delivery due to contact concerns. He noted a commitment to in-patient capacity but expressed uncertainty about the timeline and acknowledged a decrease in women seeking mother and baby unit provision due to fear and lockdown measures. He emphasized that planning would not be based on this temporary reduction in service use.",
    "The Together for Children and Young People programme is scheduled to end in October. The legacy arrangements for the programme are currently under discussion with Welsh Government officials. The CAMHS network, part of the NHS mental health network, will most likely take over. The whole-school approach element is already settled in Government.\n\nRegarding the risk of losing focus, there is a need to ensure that no strands are left hanging as the programme ends, particularly concerning early help and enhanced support, as well as psychological support, which extends beyond the NHS.\n\nThe committee heard that work is underway to enhance the scope of services, including weekend and out-of-hours admissions. There was a concern that the right workforce need to be in place before that gets implemented.\n\nThere was also a discussion about networking within the PRU and transition arrangements. The programme developed transition guidance, which is currently under evaluation. The Children's Commissioner is focused on transition, and there is a working group with Welsh Government looking at this.\n",
    "The group had a few thoughts on infra-red functionality and disposable income. One member stated that in their opinion, infra-red was the best way to project information to the receiver because you don't need a sight line. They also stated that the chip that converts the electrical energy into data and then goes through the infra-red is crucial.\n\nWhen discussing disposable income, the group was considering the target audience. The marketing team member suggested that they should aim for a younger group, specifically between fifteen and thirty-five years old, as this demographic is more likely to have disposable income for technology. Another member agreed, noting that this population has quite a bit of disposable income to spend on technology.\n",
    "The group's opinion on using eligibility for free school meals (FSM) as a measure is that it is the best available proxy for identifying pupils to target, but it is not perfect. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledges the absence of a better, more focused measure. There is a discussion of moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure, and a desire for a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. \n\nThe group notes that PDG has improved attendance, but there is still a gap between FSM and non-FSM pupils. Schools are using PDG to address attendance by employing staff to work with families, monitoring attendance, and visiting homes. However, they acknowledge that there is more to do to address this particular agenda of attainment.\n",
    "Professor F seems to have a generally positive, though not thoroughly explored, view of support vector machines (SVMs). He notes that SVMs are reputed to be better than neural nets or Gaussian mixtures, especially when there is only a modest amount of data, as SVMs can reduce the parameterization of the model by keeping certain selected examples. \n\nRegarding speech rate algorithms, the professor does not mention speech rate algorithms directly. However, he does discuss Carmen's work using MLPs to determine if speech is voiced, unvoiced, or silence. The professor suggests ways to improve the accuracy of these voice activity detection systems, such as using energy and spectral slope as features.",
    "Professor E shares his opinion on echoes, reverberation, and acoustic events in a few different ways. Regarding echoes and reverberation, he states that it may be useful to high-pass filter the speech to reduce some of the effects of reverberation. He also notes that some of the re-synthesized audio has echoes in the background.\n\nRegarding acoustic events, Professor E. and the team discuss the challenges of defining and categorizing them. He notes that defining what is meant by \"events\" can be difficult, and there is an attempt to clarify the definition to include points of overlap between speakers and interruptions. He suggests focusing on speaker overlaps as a distinct phenomenon, as it would speed up the marking process and provide a more manageable dataset for analysis. Professor E. points out the importance of using distant microphones to capture overlaps effectively.\n",
    "The team discussed the user interface design of the remote control, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. They reviewed user requirements and technical function designs, ultimately deciding to prioritize a user-friendly experience over advanced features.\n\nThe team decided to focus on essential functions like channel selection, volume control, and power, while minimizing the number of buttons. They explored options like a wheel for incremental channel and volume adjustments and considered a backlight for better visibility in the dark. They agreed to exclude teletext due to its declining usage. The team opted against an LCD display and voice recognition to expedite the development process and stay within budget. The final design will incorporate the company's logo and colors to enhance brand recognition.\n",
    "The project manager had a few thoughts about the plastic material, changeable cover, color, and shape of the model.\n\n*   **Plastic Material:** The project manager seemed to be fine with using plastic as the main case housing.\n*   **Changeable Cover:** The project manager supports the idea of changeable covers, especially rubber sleeves, as it's been popular with mobile phones.\n*   **Color:** The project manager likes the idea of multi-colored buttons, but maybe a limited multi-color scheme to avoid a childish look.

    "Participants had varying opinions regarding CD's for backup. Some noted that CDs, particularly burned ones, degrade quickly (within a year for some), making them unreliable for long-term storage. Others mentioned that while pressed CDs last longer, they also eventually degrade. An alternative suggestion was to archive data on tape and then copy it to CDs, with periodic re-burning.\n\nIn discussing probability computation, the participants acknowledged the computational complexity of testing every output node in their system, estimating it would take billions of seconds due to the numerous permutations involved.\n\nRegarding the computer navigation system's experimental setup, they discussed a \"wizard of oz\" approach where a person initially pretends to be a computer system, later revealing themselves as human to collect both human-computer and human-human interaction data. The goal is to use this data for training and development purposes.\n",
    "The group decided against symmetrical buttons on both sides because the design team felt that the current layout was more ergonomic for right-handed people, who make up the majority of the target demographic.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating both right- and left-handed remotes. The User Interface designer agreed it was possible, but the Marketing team questioned the practicality of families needing two remotes. The Industrial Designer pointed out that left-handed people adapt to right-handed devices, like computer mice. While the team acknowledged the potential benefit of catering to left-handed users, they seemed to lean towards a single design, potentially flagging the issue for management to consider further investigation.\n",
    "The group discussed cost reduction strategies extensively, primarily focusing on staying within a strict budget of 12.50 Euros. To achieve this, several features were considered for abandonment. The most significant of these was the LCD screen, which was deemed too expensive, costing around half the budget when combined with the advanced chip required to operate it. The group also considered abandoning the locator feature, USB connection, and speech recognition to reduce costs.\n\nTo reduce production costs, the group explored using plastic instead of rubber for the casing, opting for a solid unit with a single curve design. This would allow them to meet the budget. They also discussed the possibility of offering customizable covers as a way to maintain a trendy design while keeping the base product affordable.

    "The group discussed voice recognition as a potential feature for their product, and the user interface team mentioned that voice recognition technology is ready to be used and has been implemented in other commercial products. One benefit is that it could be used for special users, such as children and handicapped people. Voice recognition can also eliminate the need for a lot of buttons.\n\nHowever, one industrial designer brought up a problem with voice recognition - if there is more than one person watching TV, the speech recognizer should be able to distinguish between the two. Also, if the television is being used in a factory or shop with a lot of noise, voice commands could fail to work, which would reflect poorly on the company.",
    "The discussion on battery options revolved around several ideas. The Industrial Designer mentioned standard AA and AAA batteries but considered them too bulky. Dynamo charging (wind-up) was dismissed as impractical. Solar charging was considered but raised concerns about compatibility with standard batteries, the size of solar cells needed, and their fragility. Kinetic charging, similar to that used in wristwatches, was proposed. However, concerns were raised about whether the remote would be moved enough to maintain a charge. The Industrial Designer stated that there was no rechargeable option available.\n\nThe Industrial Designer recommended a charger instead of a battery for the industrial working design because the mobile phone batteries last a long time. The Industrial Designer stated that bundling a charger with the industrial working design would mean the customers would not have to buy batteries all the time.\n",
    "The reasons for including the project in a conference paper were multifaceted. Firstly, it was seen as a way to document the work done so far and the ideas being developed, which is always a good practice. Secondly, Nancy suggested that they wouldn't know if they had a paper until they wrote it up, indicating a need to explore the potential. Thirdly, Jerry's upcoming return provided an opportunity to get feedback on the paper. Lastly, there was a desire to present their work at the \"neurally, cognitively motivated architectures of natural language processing\" conference, leveraging its interdisciplinary nature and the presence of keynote speakers like Tomasello and MacWhinney. The paper could discuss what they've done and their future plans, focusing on cognitive, neural, psycho-linguistic, and construction grammar-motivated approaches to understanding language.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams did not mention the funding allocated to the consortia. In terms of university governance, she acknowledged concerns and highlighted her efforts to engage directly with university chairs. She also mentioned the independent review of governance being undertaken collaboratively by Universities Wales and HEFCW, with the intention of incorporating regulatory conditions for good governance in the PCET Bill.\n\nRegarding university mergers, Kirsty Williams stated she was not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but if individual institutions felt that was of benefit to them and their students, obviously, Welsh Government would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions.\n\nThe discussions regarding admission problems in Welsh universities focused on access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Kirsty Williams emphasized the importance of fee and access plans and the Diamond reforms in addressing these issues. She expressed a preference for longer-term, outcome-focused fee and access plans and highlighted the positive impact of student finance reforms on attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the remote, primarily its energy source, technological innovations, and overall design.\n\nRegarding the energy source, the team initially considered a long-lasting, potentially sealed battery, guaranteeing it for the product's life. There was also discussion of solar power with an alkaline battery backup. They ultimately decided to aim for a long-term battery source for simplicity in manufacturing and maintenance, expecting a lifespan of five to ten years, while acknowledging that consumers would likely replace the remote due to fashion trends before the battery life ended.\n\nTechnologically, the team considered voice recognition and custom chips but acknowledged the limitations and costs. They decided to include a touch screen, which would require more power.\n\nThe team also explored innovative features like interchangeable cases and voice-activated paging. They decided to incorporate the corporate logo. The team emphasized the importance of technological innovation and resisted efforts to compromise on this goal. The team provisionally settled on a plastic case with the touch screen.",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the remote control. Regarding the energy source, they considered basic batteries, hand dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar cells, but ultimately decided on a long-term battery for manufacturing simplicity and maintenance. The internal chip was debated, considering a custom-designed chip for voice functionality versus a cheaper, off-the-shelf option. Due to technological limitations and cost, they leaned towards an existing chip and conventional button technology, but with potential for pre-programmed voice commands.\n\nThe project announcement email was not directly discussed, but the group acknowledged the need for technological innovation and resisted watering down the product's unique features. The sample sensor and speaker were mentioned as new developments from their manufacturing division, potentially for feedback or voice recognition, but were not prioritized due to cost concerns.\n",
    "The last meeting focused on the design and finance of a remote control prototype. The team reviewed a prototype that included features like voice recognition, a slide-out panel for advanced functions, and interchangeable faces. A key design element was the inclusion of solar cells with a backup battery, emphasizing an environmentally friendly theme.\n\nHowever, the team faced a budget constraint, exceeding their goal of 1250 euros. To reduce costs, they considered removing the solar cells and backup battery, which would impact the marketing strategy focused on environmental friendliness. Ultimately, they decided to cut the solar cells. The team then evaluated the project based on criteria such as functionality, design, technology, and aesthetics, generally finding it satisfactory. Finally, the team members discussed their satisfaction with the project process, noting the productivity achieved in a single day.",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies discussed several critical aspects of the childcare offer. Hefin David AM raised concerns about the \u00a34.50 single national rate, questioning if it could lead to a two-tiered system where wealthier parents could afford better care through add-ons. Huw Irranca-Davies acknowledged this concern and stated that the \u00a34.50 rate might need variation in more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport, where pilot programs are planned.\n\nHefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies also discussed the affordability for the lowest-income working families, particularly regarding additional charges for transport, trips, food, and snacks. Hefin David AM expressed concern that these costs could disproportionately affect lower-income families. Huw Irranca-Davies admitted that if funding were unlimited, a different, more equitable approach would be ideal, but within current constraints, the transparency of the system allows parents to make informed decisions.\n\nHefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies also discussed the qualification and quality of the workforce, Hefin David AM voiced concerns about capacity growth and staffing levels, Huw Irranca-Davies asserted that the childcare offer provides an opportunity to make the sector more resilient and robust. They discussed the importance of workforce development and the need to address gaps in staffing.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line normalization centered on improving the Aurora system. PhD C explored various techniques, including using different means for silence and speech, and adjusting the time constant for normalization. They observed that C-one (a cepstral coefficient) behaved strangely with different noises, potentially affecting the estimation of means. Professor B suggested analyzing error types to understand if normalization improved some aspects while worsening others.\n\nPhD F mentioned phase normalization with long-term mean subtraction and got garbage results. The professor said that there are ways to do it all with complex arithmetic and not doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase. There were ways to potentially just work with the complex numbers and, in principle, get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum. It looked like there's a couple potential ways to do it. So you work with the complex numbers, and then when you get the spectrum, the average complex spectrum, actually divide it out as opposed to taking the log and subtracting.\n\nBarry (Grad A) was preparing for quals. He planned cheating experiments to determine the relative effectiveness of intermediate categories for classification, using perfect knowledge of voicing to influence phone recognition.\n",
    "The discussion focused on detecting important linguistic features using a multi-band system. This system, inspired by the work of Larry Saul, John Allen, and Mazin Rahim, employs sub-band features to train detectors for phonetic features like sonorance.\n\nAt the lowest level, an AND gate (product rule) combines independent tests within each sub-band to assess the presence of a feature. At a higher level, a soft OR gate aggregates the sub-band detections, indicating the presence of the feature if detected in any sub-band. The soft OR gate uses an EM algorithm to train the parameters for logistic regression.\n\nA key advantage of this approach is its explicit training for a product of errors rule, aligning with Fletcher's observations. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of target selection for intermediate features by allowing the system to learn the optimal features for detecting higher-level phonetic units. The detectors measure performance by measuring the confusions between sonorant and non-sonorant.\n",
    "The discussions on system involvement in demos included showing off the THISL tools for information retrieval, integrating them with the Transcriber interface, and visualizing prosodic features. There was also a discussion of using XML as the general format for everything.\n\nFor backups, it was suggested to put all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non-backed-up disk to save overhead, but Dave Johnson thought it was a bad idea. Instead, they decided to do manual NW archive copies and have it backed up, so if a mistake is made, they have a backup and an archive.\n\nRegarding note-taking and summaries, there were discussions about using CrossPads, having a scribe take notes, and generating summaries. One idea was to have multiple people summarize the meeting on recording, rather than writing, to save time. They also considered using the notes that someone normally takes at most meetings.\n\nOn scheduling meetings, Andreas wanted to know the agenda in advance. It was suggested that someone send out a reminder on Wednesday or Tuesday for people to send in agenda items. Professor E thought agendas might be hard because things come up that are unanticipated.\n",
    "The discussion surrounding HMRC revolved around the Welsh Government's decision to suspend work with them regarding the childcare offer. Sian Gwenllian expressed frustration, noting previous scrutiny and concerns raised about this approach, suggesting wasted time and money.\n\nJulie Morgan explained the decision was primarily based on a principle of flexibility and the desire to expand the childcare offer, which she felt HMRC would restrict. Although, she mentioned Welsh language standards issues as another reason, clarifying HMRC's bilingual service didn't align with the Welsh Ministers' standards. She emphasized that the main driver for the change was the need for a more flexible system that HMRC would limit.",
    "Professor B commented that the subjects should be numbered and that it should be clear that the system should introduce itself when called. He thought Lila did a better job than he would have guessed from just talking to her. The professor suggested that the Wednesday workshop include system stuff for the computer scientists and linguistic issues for the linguists. \n\nThe team's feedback on the person in Grenada was that she sounded fine, was more present, and did a better job than expected in the conversation.\n\nThe required elements in the new form arrangement were to make it clear in the system to introduce itself when called.\n\nGrad A suggested a belief net structure with dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out, isolating things related to the trajector, and similar things for context and discourse. Grad B thought there should be a Source-Path-Goal schema involved. He also thought that, as an intermediate step in the belief net, there should be a focus on the goal or the path.\n\nGrad B's opinion was that there should be a Source-Path-Goal schema involved and there should be a focus on the goal or path as an intermediate step in the belief net.\n",
    "Grad E and Grad A had differing levels of enthusiasm and focus regarding their experiments.\n\nGrad E seemed very involved and positive about the progress of their natural language generation experiment. They were focused on the technical details and integrations, such as the order of CBTs in XML, the conversion of XML for Bayes input, and the rewriting of German concept syntax-to-prosody rules. Grad E also seemed proactive in addressing challenges and exploring new ideas, such as integrating discourse history into the dialogue module.\n\nGrad A, on the other hand, while also engaged, appeared to be more focused on theoretical and linguistic aspects. They were working on solving problems related to plural nouns, adjective placement, and noun phrases. Grad A was also interested in collaborating with other researchers on structured belief nets and mental spaces, indicating a broader perspective on the project's goals and outcomes.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) expert favored radio waves for the remote control due to their ability to work in any direction without needing to be directly pointed at the device. However, there were concerns about radio wave interference with other home appliances and between neighbors using the same remote. A solution proposed was to incorporate a password or identification code within the radio wave signal.\n\nUltimately, the team decided against using radio waves due to the increased cost compared to infrared (IR) technology. While the marketing team initially pushed for new technologies and high-end features, the project manager wanted to stay within budget. The final decision was to focus on a more basic remote control with a minimalist design, incorporating a small joystick, an LCD screen, and a beeping function to locate the remote when lost. The extra budget was not used.\n",
    "The professor discussed noise and its effect on speech. They noted that spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering are similar noise suppression techniques, differing mainly in the exponent used for ideal filtering. The choice between these methods, along with adjustments like over-subtraction and whether to operate on mel bands or FFT bins, are additional factors to consider.\n\nThe professor mentioned noise addition after cleaning up mel bins. They also touched on the importance of noise estimation, stating that a compromise between relying on the first few frames and relying on pauses is ideal. They noted that spectral subtraction works better for stationary or slowly varying noise.\n\nThey discussed using a factor dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reduce musical noise during silence. The professor also mentioned that using a neural net to transform features is essentially a speech enhancement technique. They also discussed FIR filters and latency.",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function, focusing on user needs and technical aspects. The remote's primary function is to send commands to the TV, such as power, channel, and volume adjustments. The goal is to create a user-friendly design, minimizing the number of buttons while retaining essential functions.\n\nThe discussion included the possibility of a kinetic function, using a circular touch pad similar to an iPod for channel surfing and volume control. The idea was to have a central circular pad that could be used for scrolling through channels or adjusted for volume control, depending on the selected mode. There was also a discussion of whether the remote should work with DVD players and the best way to switch between functions.\n",
    "The team proposed a demographic marketing strategy focused on a remote control with a \"fancy look and feel,\" prioritizing aesthetics over pure functionality. Market research indicated that users desired a trendy design, with fruit and vegetable themes emerging as a fashion trend. The Industrial Designer suggested incorporating soft, spongy materials for a comfortable feel, aligning with current trends.\n\nRegarding appearance, Industrial Design and Marketing agreed on a shell-like design with a plastic body and a rubber cover, allowing for interchangeable colored sleeves. The Industrial Designer proposed kinetic charging as a marketable feature, which Marketing initially questioned due to a lack of prior market research, but later agreed to as a potential differentiator. Marketing emphasized that the product should clearly showcase the company's branding.\n",
    "Grad G's opinions are not mentioned in the meeting transcript.\n\nProfessor C believes that the SmartKom parser is too crude to capture different intentions and that it is a disaster to make separate constructions for every pragmatic reading. The professor also agreed that it is more important to know how to technically treat the different alternatives of capturing subject intention.\n\nThe meeting transcript does not mention MSG.\n\nThe meeting transcript does not mention pronouncing zero.\n\nGrad E said Fey agreed to rewrite the German concept syntax-to-prosody rules. Grad E also said Fey does not know how to program in Scheme, but that it may be doable if they get a commented version of the file. Grad D hopes Fey knows how to program in Scheme and mentioned that it can be incomprehensible if you are not used to functional programming. Grad B was unaware that Fey spoke German.",
    "The Industrial Designer indicated that user interface could be of two types: the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels comfortable with the technology, and speech recognition technology. They mentioned that a limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required, along with a microphone on the remote. They stated that if the vocabulary is limited, the system can target 95-97% accuracy. The Industrial Designer acknowledged that speech recognition technologies could increase the price. They suggested that using dynamic time warping, storing templates on a chip, could be an easier method to implement speech recognition. The marketing expert expressed that if they can sell a speech recognition remote control for twenty-five Euros, everyone would buy it.\n",
    "The discussions on priority of inspections were not mentioned in the meeting transcripts. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders did not appear in the meeting transcripts.\n\nJustin Trudeau elaborated on the governmental fund by mentioning the creation of the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6 million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice, and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. He said that while progress has been made, there is still so much more to do, because anti-black racism is real in Canada. He believes that racism never has a place in this country, and the government will do everything to eradicate it from coast to coast to coast. Trudeau did not explicitly mention his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's technical and functional designs, prototype presentation, detailed design, and specific design requirements. The user interface team presented two remote control examples, one complex and one simple, and raised questions about desired functions and complexity. The marketing team shared user research indicating dissatisfaction with current remotes, a desire for simplicity, and willingness to pay more for enhanced features like speech recognition. They emphasized the importance of channel, volume, and power buttons.\n\nThe industrial designer presented a rough schematic, including a power source, smart chip, large on/off button, and selection button for various entertainment devices. They suggested batteries for power and a universal smart chip. The team explored speech recognition, speech commands, and a \"homing\" device for locating lost remotes. They considered a charger base with a button to make the remote beep.\n\nThe discussion also covered the target group (all ages), technical literacy (little to none), and essential functions (changing channels, turning on/off). The team decided to incorporate the company's color and slogan and considered a simplified design with fewer buttons, possibly using a touch-based interface like an iPod. They also debated including DVD/VCR compatibility and settings menus, potentially hidden under a cover or accessible through a menu button.\n",
    "The team engaged in a detailed discussion and evaluation of their remote control project, focusing on the process, work division, and production plan. They assessed the prototype against pre-defined criteria such as ease of use, fashionability, technological innovation, and ergonomics, using a seven-point scale to rate each aspect.\n\nThe team discussed the limitations on creativity due to the company's initial restriction to a TV remote design. They also addressed the teamwork aspect, acknowledging the fun and usefulness of the digital pens and shared network. New ideas emerged during the process, and the team felt they were creating a desirable product.\n\nFinancially, they aimed to keep production costs below \u20ac12.50, considering components like batteries (lithium preferred), voice sensors, and interfaces. They explored options like kinetic batteries versus standard batteries and integrated scroll wheels versus push-buttons to meet the budget. Ultimately, they removed the voice recognition feature to meet the budget.\n\nOverall, the team was satisfied with the collaborative process and individual contributions, noting the importance of open communication and the ability to express ideas without feeling stifled. They found the whiteboard and digital pens helpful for brainstorming and overcoming the static nature of PowerPoint presentations. The main difficulty was the time pressure.\n",
    "The discussion on future directions covered several key areas.  It was mentioned that data collection should be altered to be more helpful for user interface design.  The use of CrossPads for note-taking was suggested, though handwriting recognition quality was a concern.  The idea of capturing summaries, either through designated note-takers or recorded summaries immediately after meetings, was also discussed.\n\nPhD D explained their multilingual model, noting that if the network is trained on task data, it performs well. There was discussion of training on broad data, with results showing that training on one language and testing on another yielded relatively poor results.  The model was trained on TI-digits English and Italian data, as well as broad English, French, and Spanish databases.\n\nPhD C and the professor discussed the challenges of multiple languages in the context of the cellular industry's image of distributed speech recognition. They explored training nets on a range of languages and the potential for language-independent feature sets. The possibility of training towards articulatory features for cross-language applicability was also raised.\n\nThe discussion about releasing meeting data and allowing people to cut things out centered on the need to anonymize data, particularly video recordings. Concerns were raised about the infrastructure and effort required for this process.  The group also discussed the logistics of releasing the meeting data and the possible legal issues.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement about the gap between program development and implementation refers to the common issue where a program is designed and planned, but its actual rollout and execution face obstacles, delays, or shortcomings. This can result in the program failing to achieve its intended goals or reaching the intended beneficiaries effectively.\n\nBased on the transcript, Kwan specifically mentions how single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not receiving adequate support despite the government being aware of the issue. She highlights the discrepancy between the intention of the program and its actual impact on vulnerable populations. In this case, there is a gap between the development and implementation of the program, leading to families in need not receiving the assistance they require.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager (PM) had mixed feelings about the last meeting review and market research. The PM seemed to get \"way too into it\" and felt like they \"slipped into it a lot\". They found the process fascinating and were curious about the debriefing. However, they also expressed some frustration with the lack of financial information earlier in the process, stating they spent an entire stage designing a product without knowing what it would cost.\n\nThe group's opinion differed from the PM's. They felt that the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day, with one member stating they didn't get any information for the last presentation. There were also concerns about the lack of real-time communication and the overwhelming amount of spam emails.\n\nRegarding the use of a panther as a drawing, the transcript does not mention a panther, so it is impossible to know the group's thoughts on the drawing.\n",
    "The team had varying opinions on the remote control's features. The Marketing Expert's research indicated younger users were enthusiastic about an LCD screen and speech recognition, while older users were less interested. The Industrial Designer noted that the use of an LCD and speech recognition would affect the electronic components needed.\n\nThe team also considered the number and type of buttons. There was a consensus that fewer buttons were desirable, but opinions differed on how to achieve this. Ideas included a hierarchical structure with category buttons (like \"movies\"), a scroll wheel for channel selection, and hiding less frequently used buttons under a cover. The User Interface expert suggested a joystick for basic functions like volume and channel control, combined with an LCD for menu navigation. \n\nThere was also a discussion about incorporating a feature to help locate the remote control when lost, such as a beeping noise triggered by a transmitter attached to the TV. The team agreed that the design should prioritize the most frequently used functions (channel and volume control) and that the remote should be easy to hold and use with one hand.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a decline in domestic and international markets because of travel restrictions and the closure of restaurants and tourist attractions. The fishing industry, closely linked to tourism in coastal communities, also suffered due to the interruption of tourism and restaurant industries.\n\nTo mitigate the impact, the government implemented measures such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to support workers who lost their jobs. The government also introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to help businesses keep employees on the payroll. Additionally, there was funding for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) to assist the tourism sector in the Atlantic region.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer presented options for the remote control's design, energy source, and components. The design options included flat, curved (one or both sides), and materials like plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium. Energy sources considered were standard batteries, kinetic energy, and solar cells. Electronic options included simple or advanced chips, with the advanced chip required for LCDs. The User Interface Designer suggested voice recognition and a small remote with few buttons, possibly with a scrolling button. The Marketing Expert emphasized the importance of technological innovation, LCDs, spinning wheels, and voice recognition.\n\nThe team discussed the need for an LCD screen, its potential for providing feedback, and the possibility of a flip-open design. They considered rubber for the case, but latex cases would prevent the use of solar cells. They decided against a completely flat case and wood. Push-buttons were deemed necessary for channel numbers, but LCDs could offer more options.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on an LCD display with a spinning wheel, voice recognition, a simple battery, an advanced chip, and a curved case (folded in on itself) made of rubber. The remote would have push-buttons on the outside and an LCD with a spinning wheel inside. The color scheme would be bright vegetable colors. The Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer will collaborate on a prototype using modeling clay.\n",
    "The meetings discussed a paper with three sections. The first section focuses on the amount of overlap in speech, measured by the number of words and \"spurts\" (stretches of speech without pauses exceeding 500 milliseconds). The analysis compared four corpora: Meeting Recorder meetings, Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. The results showed that Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome (roughly equal), with Robustness meetings having the least. The statistics included overlap percentages, with Meeting Recorder meetings at 17-18% and Robustness meetings at about half that.\n\nThe second section of the paper discussed how overlaps affect recognition performance, expanding on previous HLT paper results. They added a number showing what happens when scoring ignores all speech outside of foreground speech. Results showed that recognition error decreased to near non-overlapped speech levels when only foreground speech regions were scored.\n\nThe third section examined \"interrupts,\" defined as instances where someone starts a sentence during overlapping speech. The analysis looked at the tags of words (spurt tag, discourse markers, backchannels, disfluencies) right before these interrupt locations. The results indicated that interruptions were more likely after discourse markers, backchannels, or filled pauses.\n\nThere was no mention of DARPA in the meeting transcripts.",
    "The group discussed training and testing a digits corpus and agreed that they would use the standard TI-digits training set and test on a specific test set, expecting good performance. They also agreed to test on a distant microphone setup, anticipating poor results initially, with the goal of improvement over time. They also discussed the Aurora data set, which includes connected digits with car noise, and its potential challenges.\n\nThe current technique involves using HTK for training, with efforts to transform TIMIT labels for training a neural net and comparing it to one trained on digits alone, to see the difference between general and specific speech. The limitations include potential confusion due to hand-labeled TIMIT data and phone set differences between TIMIT and digits. They also discussed using a cube with feature, training data, and testing data dimensions.\n\nProgress includes using the Aurora data set and HTK, re-installing HTK, and working on TIMIT labels.\n\nDelays are anticipated due to the time required for training, particularly the neural net, and the need for manual transcription.\n",
    "In the meeting transcripts provided, there is no discussion on the advantages of \"triple R\" over \"triple RC\" in the product's name.\n\nThe marketing team decided to target young people (specifically fifteen to thirty-five-year-olds) because they are considered early adopters of new devices and are more likely to be interested in features like voice recognition. This age group also has a higher disposable income, making them more likely to purchase the product. However, it was also suggested that the target group could be defined by how much money they have to spend, or to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is.\n\nThe selection of channels was not explicitly discussed.\n",
    "The group discussed market research findings indicating users find current remote controls ugly and unintuitive, using only a small percentage of the available buttons. Channel, volume, and power buttons were deemed most important. Frustrations included losing the remote and difficulty learning new ones. Younger demographics desired LCD screens and voice recognition.\n\nDesign opinions centered on reducing button clutter, possibly using rolling buttons or a hierarchical structure accessed via an LCD. A slider for volume/channel was suggested, alongside consideration for TV settings access. The industrial designer favored infrared over radio waves for simplicity and cost, though radio waves offer directional flexibility. The possibility of a \"handshaking\" protocol to prevent interference was raised.\n\nThe necessity of revolution in remote control interaction was debated. The project manager emphasized simplicity and fashion, aligning with the company's slogan. The marketing expert highlighted user prioritization of look and feel. A minimalist approach with a joystick, LCD, and few buttons was proposed, drawing inspiration from mobile phone interfaces. The ability to locate a lost remote via a beeping noise was considered. The group aimed for a design appealing to a younger demographic (15-35) while remaining user-friendly for all.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM discussed several key points regarding her education plan. First, she emphasized the importance of a quality assurance process, with \"quality improvement practitioners\" holding workshops in October to refine the curriculum based on feedback, aiming for final publication in January 2020.\n\nBethan Owen raised concerns about the \"high-risk\" category of schools. Kirsty Williams AM explained five principles for reopening schools: safety, alignment with government response, clear communication, prioritization of specific groups, and operational safety. She also emphasized that schools would only reopen when it was safe to do so, based on medical and scientific advice.\n\nFor new examinations and school qualifications, teachers will submit grades based on professional judgment and available data. Qualifications Wales will then moderate this data to ensure fairness and robustness in the qualifications system.\n\nIn response to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions, Kirsty Williams AM highlighted their willingness to listen and adapt, emphasizing that practitioners and experts, not just ministers and civil servants, are involved in shaping the curriculum, and that they are co-constructing the curriculum with partners.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the team had both positive and negative feelings when evaluating the entire production process.\n\nLikes:\n*   The team appreciated the control they had over the project, including the technological advancements and fashionable aspects of the remote.\n*   They enjoyed the teamwork aspect, particularly using the digital pens, laptops, and shared network, despite some initial irritations.\n*   The team felt the final product was cool, technologically advanced, and that it aligned with the company's fashion-forward strategy.\n*   There was agreement that the final costs were within budget.\n\nDislikes:\n*   Some team members felt stifled creatively by the company's restriction to only using a TV remote design.\n*   There was concern that the product was limited to TV use only.\n*   The team questioned the fruit shape and the lack of a screen.\n*   Some members felt the leadership could have been more structured.\n*   There were issues with the SMARTboard pen, as it was not user-friendly, precise, or quick to use.",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments centers around its implementation and effectiveness in noise reduction for speech recognition. One participant, grad e, tested mean log magnitude spectral subtraction, exploring different window lengths (12 seconds, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 6 seconds) and training scenarios. The experiments involved calculating the mean using past-only data versus centered windows. The results indicated that performance was slightly better with centered windows.\n\nProfessor C suggested viewing mean cepstral subtraction as a type of filter, highlighting its high-pass or band-pass filtering characteristics. He noted that by limiting the filter to a subtraction of the mean, potential temporal and spectral behaviors of more sophisticated filters are not utilized.\n\nThe discussion also touched upon whether to exclude silence regions when calculating the mean. Professor C proposed a ramp-up approach where the mean is computed over increasing time intervals (2, 4, 6 seconds), essentially creating a filter that builds up over time. The discussion also addressed how to use the technique in interactive systems, potentially caching utterances to improve performance over time. Furthermore, they considered a second-pass approach where a simpler mechanism is used initially, followed by a more complex one with longer time windows.\n",
    "The discussion included mixed signals, VAD improvements, and VAD results, with PhD c using the old Munich system with Gaussian mixtures for speech and nonspeech detection and creating two mixtures for loud and quiet speakers. Postdoc F noted that Adam and Dave think it's a terrific improvement.\n\nPostdoc A's opinion on new headphones was not explicitly discussed, but there was mention of uncomfortable headphones and a plan to find more comfortable ones.\n\nAlternative methods to increase space were not discussed. Instead, the meeting explored alternative methods to represent overlaps in transcriptions, including modifying the interface or using existing tools.\n\nThe deadline was discussed and postdoc F mentioned that their goal was to get eleven hours of transcription done by the end of the month.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, special schools are not specifically mentioned in relation to the new purpose arrangement. However, the discussion around the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for looked-after children sheds some light on how special schools may fit into the broader context of targeted funding.\n\nThe regional consortia are responsible for the strategic deployment of the PDG for looked-after children. This resource can be used in various ways, including individual allocation to a school to support a child, or capacity building for the whole system. The consortia have also appointed regional Looked After Children (LAC) coordinators. The role of schools with PDG for looked-after children is to implement programs and interventions that support these children.\n\nThe EAS consortium spends the vast bulk of the pupil deprivation grant on a specific programme, aimed not at LACs specifically, but at all children considered vulnerable at times of transition, particularly into year 7. There are concerns that if the grant is specifically for looked-after children, it should be more targeted.",
    "The team, consisting of the User Interface designer, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager, discussed the prototype of a universal remote control. The remote would have a unique design, moving away from the standard square shape, potentially resembling a mouse or hairbrush for comfortable handling.\n\nKey aspects of making it universal included:\n*   **Interoperability:** The remote should work with different TVs and devices, controlling multiple pieces of equipment.\n*   **Communication Method:** The team discussed ways of communication with the equipment, including infrared and Bluetooth.\n*   **Button Functionality:** Buttons would be limited to basic functions like power, channel change, and volume, with advanced settings accessible through a menu on the TV screen.\n*   **Target Audience:** The product would be targeted at a broad public, especially younger consumers.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the importance of making the remote trendy and user-friendly, with a focus on a unique design and easy-to-learn functionality.\n",
    "During the meetings, the Industrial Designer, Fabien, provided several comments regarding the remote control prototype's appearance, structure, and customer preferences. He expressed a preference for a spongy design, while also acknowledging the need for a hard shell inside to protect the electronic components.\n\nFabien suggested using solar cells as an additional energy source, particularly if speech recognition was implemented. He also mentioned that the material used for the device was not a concern of his. He agreed that the buttons should be big.\n\nIn terms of customer preferences, Fabien supported the idea of interchangeable casings and color combinations named after fruits and vegetables, aligning with current fashion trends. He also emphasized the importance of ergonomics and a single-handed design for user comfort. He was okay with a banana shape.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, there is no mention of allocating $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking, nor is there a solution to risk appetite presented.\n\nHowever, there is discussion of systemic racism, particularly anti-Black racism, in Canada and the United States. Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges that anti-black racism, unconscious bias, and systemic discrimination are real issues in Canada. Several members discuss the need to address racial profiling, over-policing, and over-incarceration of Black and Indigenous people. The government highlights existing efforts, such as investments in mental health services for those who have experienced racism and the creation of the anti-racism secretariat with a $4.6 million envelope. There is a call for race-based data collection to better understand and respond to the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities.\n",
    "The current speech/non-speech segmenter uses the old Munich system, which is a Gaussian mixture-based system. It uses one Gaussian for silence and one for speech. For dialogues with quiet speakers, two mixtures are used: one for loud speakers and one for quiet speakers. The system uses loudness-based spectrum on a mel scale with twenty critical bands, loudness, energy, modified loudness, and zero-crossing rate as features. The segmenter saves the transcribers a lot of time. There is also interest in using cross-correlation to improve the selection of who is talking.",
    "Based on the meetings, the User Interface (UI) and Industrial Designer (ID) disagreed on the price because the UI designer felt that some features were essential for the remote to be marketable and user friendly. They believed programming for the menus was necessary, while the Industrial Designer was focused on keeping costs down.\n\nThe UI designer disagreed on the redesign after product evaluation because they felt that changes were needed to ensure the product's success and to address user feedback, but the project manager stated that no more changes would be made to the basic design.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as basic colors for the product appearance because those were the company colors, and they were trying to align the product with the brand.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the UI designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance because the team felt that the banana shape was too abstract, and they preferred a more ergonomic design.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil, all representing ColegauCymru, expressed reservations about the Welsh baccalaureate's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment. Evans stated employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac's meaning and content, suggesting the \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" is more readily understood. Brazil echoed this, noting that employers prioritize professional qualifications and skills over the Welsh bac, which he feels has become overly bureaucratic and demanding. Martin agreed, stating employers prioritize core qualifications (e.g., engineering) alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.\n\nAll three suggested the vision for the Welsh Bac was good, but that it has lost its way. They all agreed there was value to the qualification, but that a review involving employers is needed to ensure employability and entrepreneurial skills play a more significant role. They also acknowledge that there are other programmes that are already working well.\n",
    "The team presented several ideas and designs for a remote control. The Industrial Designer shared options for the remote's shape (flat, curved), materials (plastic, rubber, wood, titanium), and buttons (push-buttons, scrolling). They emphasized the importance of inexpensive PCB configurations, allowing for design flexibility. The Marketing Expert suggested kinetic energy for charging and voiced the need for technological innovation, LCD screens, spinning wheels, colors, and voice recognition.\n\nThe User Interface Designer focused on user-friendliness, suggesting voice recognition with pre-programmed answers and scrolling buttons. The team discussed the pros and cons of LCD screens on the remote versus feedback through the TV, ultimately leaning towards LCDs for style and immediate feedback. They also explored a flip-open design, rubber casing for ergonomics and protection, and the use of company colors. The team ultimately decided to include voice recognition and a LCD screen with a spinning wheel, push buttons, advanced chip, rubber casing curved on one side, and bright vegetable colors.\n",
    "The Project Manager had mixed feelings about the new remote control's features. Initially, they questioned whether the early adopter target market for speech recognition was large enough to justify the feature. However, they were open to considering it if it translated to exceeding the four million sales target.\n\nRegarding market range and price issues, the Project Manager seemed concerned about the 12.50 Euro cost constraint, especially with the proposed features. They were interested in offering a \"kind of universal control for less money,\" suggesting a desire to balance functionality with affordability.\n\nRegarding setting the selling target, the Project Manager emphasized the necessity of meeting the four million sales target. They also stressed the importance of aligning the design with the corporate image, color, and slogan.\n\nDuring discussions, the Project Manager pushed to define the target market group. They agreed that the younger end was the target market, but they also raised concerns about whether this group had enough purchasing power for television remote controls. They explored the possibility of targeting manufacturers instead of consumers.\n",
    "User Interface had several thoughts regarding the new remote control project. Economically, they felt pushbuttons were the way to go, as it would be cheaper than a scroll button and would allow for a simple chip. They were intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel, but it was not a necessity. User Interface thought that the kinetic battery was a good idea, assuming the cost and reliability were acceptable. They also advocated for an on-screen display menu for the television that would allow the user to access advanced features while keeping a small set of buttons for the features used most often.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding the use of kinetic energy and making the product upgradable because of the following reasons:\n\nKinetic Energy: The Industrial Designer suggested kinetic energy as a power source, similar to modern watches. Marketing questioned the practicality of kinetic energy for a remote control, as it often lies still and would require constant tapping, which could frustrate users.\n\nUpgradability: The Industrial Designer suggested a basic mold made of plastic with a rubber cover, allowing for different designs. However, titanium cases can only be a standard box shape. The marketing team wanted the product to be upgradable and have different fascia for the phone, but the Industrial Designer didn't think it would be available at all in titanium.\n\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal several discussions and decisions regarding HEFCW's powers of intervention. HEFCW expressed concerns that their powers were inflexible, difficult to use for swift interventions, and somewhat \"threatening,\" with only a few steps between informal measures and severe sanctions.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged this feedback and indicated a desire for more flexible regulatory powers for the new tertiary education commission, including advice, guidance, and enhanced monitoring, alongside punitive interventions for severe cases. The goal is a graduated escalation approach.\n\nRegarding the current situation, the Minister noted that HEFCW had not yet used its full powers of intervention in recent high-profile issues at Swansea and Trinity St David, but had instead supported the institutions. The Minister stated that she trusts HEFCW's professional judgment but expects them to use their full powers if necessary. Overall, the aim is to strike a balance between institutional autonomy and the ability to influence national outcomes.",
    "The marketing strategy revolves around creating an attractive and easily accessible product, primarily targeting TV users. The group aims for an impulse purchase at a price point of twenty-five Euros, focusing on simplicity and intuitive use.\n\nTo achieve this, the plan incorporates key features such as easy findability (through light emission or beeping) and fluorescent buttons for visibility in the dark. The design should be compact, user-friendly, and potentially available in different shapes and colors to appeal to a broad audience, including children and the elderly. There is also consideration for the buttons to have clear text and be designed for easy tactile use.\n\nThe group acknowledges budget constraints and has ruled out complex features like whole-house control and compatibility with multiple devices. The emphasis is on a simple, functional design, which aims to be cost-effective while maintaining the corporate image and color scheme. The goal is to balance functionality, design, and price to create a product with high perceived value, leading to the desired profit.\n",
    "During the pandemic, the discussion focused on providing continuity for free-school-meal children. Schools were expected to play a role in providing safe and secure places for children of frontline workers, including those involved in the coronavirus response.\n\nLocal authorities and schools were tasked with developing plans to provide emergency free school meals, with the understanding that initial responses might evolve into longer-term solutions. There was a commitment to ongoing provision, aiming for a seamless transition without disruption during formal holiday periods.\n\nThe discussion emphasized the importance of collaboration between local government, schools, and social services to identify and support vulnerable children, including those on the at-risk register. Teachers were acknowledged as key in identifying children needing extra support, respecting their professional judgment in sensitive situations. Special schools were also considered, aiming to support vulnerable children attending them, even if in small numbers.",
    "User Interface (UI) considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design to align with the goal of creating a trendy, user-friendly remote control. The curved design aimed to provide a comfortable grip. The agreement on \"easy to use\", \"fashion\", \"easy to find\", and \"robust\" features stemmed from market research indicating that consumers prioritize a fancy outlook over pure functionality.\n\nUI evaluated the fashion style of the remote control based on current fashion trends, particularly the influence of \"fruit and veg\" aesthetics in furniture and clothing. They discussed incorporating these trends through the shape and material of the remote, considering options like a spongy, organic form inspired by fruits or vegetables.\n"
