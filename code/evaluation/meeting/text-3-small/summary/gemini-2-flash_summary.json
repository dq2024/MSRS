    "The group discussed several changes and issues related to data collection and transcription. The professor and the group agreed that they should try to get a variety of meetings but should not specify rules of interaction. The group also thought it would be beneficial to get more native English speakers.\n\nRegarding the use of English, the group discussed having meetings in English to allow for better language models and to avoid interlanguage issues. There was a concern about the proficiency of some undergraduates and the potential for a mixed bag of language skills, making it harder to build language models. However, it was suggested that as long as the meeting is held in English, it would be acceptable if a few participants had less proficient English skills.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in the context of a remote control design project. The user interface designer expressed concern that the initial price point was specified before understanding user needs and willingness to pay for the product. The group agreed that market research was needed to determine what features users would expect for a remote control priced at 25 euros.\n\nLater in the meetings, the team reviewed a prototype design, considering factors like ergonomics, functionality, and materials. The project manager presented a cost analysis showing that the production cost was initially below the budget of 12.5 euros. However, the marketing expert pointed out that the analysis didn't include the cost of the LCD display or marketing expenses, which could significantly increase the unit cost. They discussed the need to sell two million units at a profit of 25 euros per unit to reach the company's target of 50 million euros in profit. The team also explored alternative sales channels, such as online sales, to potentially lower costs and increase sales volume.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions about the uncertainty of the Canadian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's actions to mitigate its impact.\n\nCathy McLeod did not contribute to the discussion in this meeting.\n\nMona Fortier emphasized the government's commitment to the health and safety of Canadians and to building a stronger, more resilient economy. She defended the government's actions by referring to the importance of science in guiding decisions related to COVID-19 and climate change. She also reiterated the government's commitment to supporting Canadians and ensuring their environmental, economic, and physical well-being.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie expressed concern that the government was contracting out its recovery plan to the private sector. He was concerned that it would be too late to do an economic update when things are more stable and that the government needs to loosen the purse strings.\n",
    "The industrial manager, whose role was to design the details of the product, expressed admiration for the tiger's sleekness and stylishness. The manager considered the tiger a source of inspiration for the remote control design, emphasizing the need for a design that is not overly crowded with buttons, similar to new generation phones without buttons. The manager also expressed a desire for the remote control to have a good tactile feel, and the tiger's furriness and the way horses feel under the hand were mentioned in this context. The manager did not want the product to be boring, and tigers are not boring.\n",
    "The team discussed the transcriber interface and alternative transcription tools, focusing on improving overlap encoding. The current interface limits the ability to capture detailed start and end points of overlaps.\n\nTo address this, they explored expanding the interface and investigating existing tools. Ideal solutions included a thorough musical score notation for its multi-channel, single-timeline clarity. Dave Gelbart offered interface modification ideas, while the team considered existing interfaces, including one used by Susanne Burger at CMU for simultaneous eight-channel transliterations.\n\nThe team acknowledged the need for readily available data and prioritized the current transcription process. Dave Gelbart volunteered to modify the existing Transcriber tool. The modifications would focus on displaying only the mix waveform while allowing users to edit different channels and creating separate output files for each channel to preserve overlaps.",
    "The presentations covered various aspects of designing a new remote control. Market research indicated that users want a modern, simplified remote with fewer buttons and are frustrated by remotes that are easily lost. A tracking device was suggested.\n\nThe user interface presentation emphasized a user-centered design, focusing on the image and appearance of the remote. A universal remote may be too complex, so concentrating on a TV remote was suggested.\n\nThe industrial designer discussed the internal components and materials. Wood was proposed for the case due to its environmentally friendly nature and the possibility of customization. An advanced chip on print was recommended, integrating an infrared sender, sensor, and speaker.\n\nTrend watching revealed that consumers desire a \"fancy and feel-good\" remote that is easy to use and innovative. The potential for customizability was highlighted as a key selling point.\n",
    "The discussion of early implementer areas focused on several key aspects. One was the potential of using CrossPads for data collection, which would allow people to write down notes and mark them somehow. However, the quality of handwriting recognition was a concern. Another idea was to develop code for frequent actions to simplify the process. The summaries generated from the data were considered a reasonable bootstrap for identifying what people want to know. Analyzing word frequency in summaries could reveal common topics across different types of meetings. Additionally, the idea of having multiple people provide summaries was discussed to avoid bias from a single note-taker's perspective. It was also suggested to ask participants what they found most interesting in the meeting to capture micro-level details. The meeting participants also discussed the balance between structured data collection and preserving the natural flow of conversation.",
    "The Project Manager held several opinions on the product's features. They were initially hesitant about incorporating voice recognition software due to cost concerns. However, they later warmed to the idea when it was suggested as an upgraded version for business-class customers.\n\nRegarding technology, the Project Manager mentioned using standard chips to avoid potential problems. They also noted that the type of button used on the bottom half of the remote, and the material it was made from, was intended to minimize RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury).\n\nWhen it came to LCD incorporation, the Project Manager did not offer many comments, but did note that the black and white touch screen would be inset. Regarding the button design, the Project Manager noted that the type of button used in the bottom half, and the material it was made from, was intended to minimize RSI.\n",
    "The team discussed standardizing recording conventions to improve speech recognition and transcription. A key concern was the inconsistent quality of audio due to varying microphone types and placement. The team decided to order more of the same head-mounted microphones, ensuring consistent placement near the corner of the mouth to minimize breath sounds. They also discussed time-aligning separately recorded signals.\n\nThe team also explored the possibility of incorporating video recordings and microphone arrays. There was interest in this, but concerns were raised about infrastructure requirements, human subject permissions, and the lack of a dedicated researcher. While not a current priority, the team acknowledged the value of such data and was open to collaboration if a researcher with relevant expertise joined the project. They discussed the potential for portable microphone arrays and expressed interest in visiting John Canny. They also discussed NIST's interest in video recording.\n",
    "The discussion on project finance centered around the target selling price of the remote control, set at 25 euros, with the goal of generating a profit of 50 million euros. There was a question about whether the remote would be a stand-alone unit or specific to a device. It was noted that setting the price before defining the product was unusual, and the team needed to determine what features people expected for that price point. The marketing team was tasked with researching what people are willing to pay for a remote control.\n\nThe drawing board was used during the initial kick-off meeting as an icebreaker. Team members were asked to draw their favorite animal on the whiteboard to familiarize themselves with the room's tools. This activity was intended to be lighthearted and creative.",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer, Christine, initially expressed confusion about the project's goal, believing they were designing a monitor instead of a remote control. She emphasized the importance of a fashionable and attractive design, drawing inspiration from the iPod's success. Christine also voiced concerns about material durability and cost.\n\nThe Project Manager, Shrida Daseri, focused on gathering information and setting expectations. She consistently requested project plans, functional designs, technical designs, timelines, and budgets from the team members. Shrida also stressed the importance of collaboration between team members, especially between the Industrial Designer and the Marketing team, to ensure a cohesive product and sales strategy.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the team should proceed with a voice recognition remote with a non-traditional shape. The Project Manager also noted the decision to exclude a touch screen, incorporate simple design features, and include a slide-out bay for advanced functions.\n",
    "The team's decision-making process for the remote's base involved considering various factors. Initially, there was a discussion about whether to include a charger and a base station with a homing device to address the common problem of losing remotes. While the homing device was generally favored, the charger and base station were questioned due to potential cost increases.\n\nThe evaluation of the remote's fashionability was a key concern, driven by market research indicating that 80% of users were willing to spend more for a fancier remote. The team aimed for a modern, eye-catching design that would appeal to a wide range of consumers, especially younger demographics interested in voice recognition. There was a consensus that current remotes were generally considered \"hideous\" and that a sleek, simple design was necessary.\n\nThe team also discussed the pros and cons of existing remotes. They noted that many remotes have too many buttons, with users typically only using 10% of them. This led to the idea of simplifying the remote and reducing the number of buttons. They considered hiding less frequently used buttons under a flip cover or accessing advanced functions through a menu button. The team also explored the possibility of voice recognition as a way to simplify the user interface and appeal to younger users.\n",
    "The group discussed using an environmentally-friendly material, possibly latex, for the remote's case, aligning with a current trend of \"spongy\" materials and a fashion trend involving fruits and vegetables. Potential materials included plastic, wood, latex, titanium, and rubber. An LCD screen was considered for advanced features, with concerns about cost and practicality.\n\nThe group explored various colors inspired by fruits and vegetables for the case and buttons. The idea of a spongy material was linked to ergonomics and grip. A key material and function issue revolved around protecting internal components within a latex case.\n\nThe questionnaire showed that a fancy look and feel were most important, followed by ease of use. The group also considered a questionnaire to gather more market data on remote control preferences.\n",
    "The Project Manager introduced the remote control prototype as a universal remote intended for a broad consumer base, not a specific vendor. The Industrial Designer emphasized interoperability and trendy design, while the User Interface designer focused on user-centered design, fewer buttons, and a focus on the remote's image.\n\nThe group discussed multi-functional versus single-functional products, with the User Interface designer suggesting focusing on TV remotes due to the complexity of universal remotes. The Industrial Designer suggested the possibility of using touch screen or a stick.\n\nThe technological aspect received lower grades due to cost constraints and concerns about speech recognition reliability, including potential interference from TV audio.\n\nThe Marketing Expert presented research indicating that 50% of users often lose their remotes, which led to the consideration of incorporating a tracking device or locator in the functional requirements.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C agreed to compare their overlap analysis to Switchboard and CallHome to determine if there's more overlap in meetings or if it's due to the lack of the other channel in Switchboard. Jose had been working on a method to normalize energy to detect overlaps, but hadn't found a reliable indicator. It was suggested that he use pitch and harmonic-related measures or expand on Javier's existing system. \n\nDue to interface limitations, overlaps weren't being encoded as completely as desired, leading to a discussion on expanding the interface or finding other tools, like a musical score notation. However, the need for extensive transcribing may decrease with outside sponsorship, but the current transcribers could potentially be used for more detailed overlap analysis.",
    "The discussion on latency revealed that the initial system had a total latency of 330 milliseconds. Through filter modifications, specifically using IIR filters instead of FIR filters, a reduction of 136 milliseconds was achieved in the low-frequency band filtering, bringing the latency down to around 240 milliseconds. However, other processes, like downsampling and online normalization, introduced additional delays of 10 milliseconds and 85 milliseconds, respectively.\n\nProfessor C expressed concern because the project was just barely within the allowable 250-millisecond latency limit. The professor was concerned about the potential need to significantly reduce latency if the standards changed, especially considering that other proposals had latencies as low as 30-40 milliseconds. The professor also emphasized the need for better communication within the team to avoid latency-related issues in the future.\n",
    "The introduced features of the prototype design by User Interface include a wheel sensor and push buttons. The design aims for simplicity, potentially rejecting unnecessary buttons. The features include a banana shape with buttons on the side, making it ergonomic and suitable for both right and left-handed users. It also incorporates a wheel on the top for control. A lighted button feature that allows easy identification of the right side. The design prioritizes a fancy look and feel, aligning with current trends of fruits and vegetables as themes. The design should be spongy for robustness and comfortable handling. The design is innovative and easy to use.",
    "The prototype presentation highlighted two versions of a new remote control. The first prototype featured a gunmetal gray plastic base with a curved, concave design for comfortable handling. It had black labeling, thumb-shaped menu and mute buttons, and number buttons, with channel and volume controls on either side. The entire remote lit up when any button was pressed.\n\nThe second prototype resembled a \"giant delicious cookie.\" The evaluation criteria included ease of use, fashionability, and feel. The discussion involved rating the prototype on a seven-point scale for each criterion.\n\nIn conclusion, the team discussed the materials, battery type (lithium was preferred), and the possibility of including two or three push-button interfaces. The final decision was to move forward with the prototype model, pending further evaluation.",
    "The group discussed several design elements of the new remote control, including a touch screen, flip screens, battery, and flip-top design, while considering budget limitations and functionalities.\n\nThe touch screen was a central point, with the group deciding to include it for a sleek, modern look, potentially with submenus for extra features. Concerns were raised about the cost of incorporating the touch screen with voice recognition capabilities. The group considered potential trade-offs, such as removing the voice recognition feature to meet the budget.\n\nThe flip-top design with two separate PCBs connected by cabling at the hinge was decided upon. The top screen would be a black and white touch screen, while the bottom screen would contain standard buttons.\n\nRegarding the battery, kinetic batteries were initially considered, potentially attaching to the flipping motion for charging. However, standard batteries, particularly lithium, were also discussed due to cost and practicality. The group ultimately decided to go with a lithium battery.\n\nThe flip screens were designed to have a plastic body with customizable color options. The group also discussed the possibility of adding a logo, either bezeled, inset, or engraved, without interfering with the product's overall look.\n",
    "The Welsh Government takes several lessons from the Schools Challenge Cymru program and is applying them to the wider school improvement agenda. They include strong and capable school leadership, comprehensive tracking systems and processes, consistent strategies to improve teacher quality, and collaborative activities that allow schools to learn from each other's best practices. The regional consortia employ some of the best individuals from the Schools Challenge Cymru, making their expertise available to all schools.\n\nThe program is progressing through the regional consortia, which are continuing the improvement boards. Schools are categorized to determine the level of support they need, with red schools receiving 25 days of support, more than they would have received under the Schools Challenge Cymru program. This system allows for a focus on schools that need intensive support, regardless of their location or sector. The regional consortia are challenged to ensure schools are using the PDG effectively and following an evidence base for their programs.",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes Brexit has already impacted Wales' higher education system. He notes an 8% decrease in applications from EU students, contrasting with a 2% increase in England. He attributes this drop to two factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students (who now have to find the full fee) and the Anglocentric nature of the UK media.\n\nHe also suspects that the relative levels of investment in facilities, particularly buildings and kit, between Wales and England have an impact, with prospective students being more attracted to campuses in better states of repair.\n\nDr. Blaney highlights the \"Study in Wales\" program as a collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, emphasizing its relative safety and supportive environment compared to larger cities in England. He believes that the UK degree is available in Wales in a way that is safer and more supportive.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the domains in the mental spaces include Source-Path-Goal (SPG), Forced Motion (FM), and Caused Action. The middle layer would function as a rich action description (RAD) that enriches or augments the M-3L structures with additional information about the underlying intention. This layer aims to bridge the gap between a simple parse of an utterance and the actual intention of the person. It tries to guess what the underlying intention was and then enrich or augment the M-3L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance. The RAD is intended to provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the action being described, going beyond the basic \"action go\" structure. The middle layer would use schemas, such as the SPG schema, to categorize actions and fill roles with relevant information. It would also allow for multiple schemas to be active in parallel, enabling the system to capture different aspects of a single utterance.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the professor believes that a belief-net is a good way of inferential combination and is interested in seeing how it can be used for deeper understanding. The professor thinks it is important to figure out a way to featurize data to get a discrete number of features. The professor also wants to choose a belief-net package with good interactive abilities to determine which of three intentions are most likely. The professor wants to be able to interchange in and out of any module built and wants the core of the system to work in a way that they are comfortable with.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts address several key issues. The seniors care crisis was discussed, highlighting the disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes and appalling conditions reported by the Canadian Armed Forces. The need for national standards of care and a review of for-profit models was raised.\n\nThe relationship between racism and long-term care in government policy was touched upon, with discussions on systemic racism against indigenous peoples and black Canadians, including concerns about racial profiling and use of force by law enforcement. A commitment to collect race-based data to address injustice was mentioned.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were brought up, particularly in the context of CERB and EI eligibility, wage subsidies, and support for specific sectors like tourism, forestry, and energy. Concerns were raised about the inflexibility of programs and the need for tailored support.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay's perspective on the public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families was mentioned, including the encouragement of veterans and their families to participate in public discussions.\n\nThere was no mention of the Minister of Seniors' statement on pandemic assistance for seniors.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, disagreements about the remote control design arose from differing priorities and perspectives among the Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer.\n\nMarketing focused on \"sizzle\" and features that would drive impulse purchases, prioritizing aesthetics, ease of use, and a low learning curve to attract customers, potentially favoring features that might not be technically optimal. The Industrial Designer was concerned with technical feasibility, functionality, and adding features that would enhance usability, such as fluorescent buttons, a child lock, and compatibility with multiple devices. However, the Project Manager interjected and said that management had already eliminated the ability to control multiple devices.\n\nThe Project Manager aimed to balance these competing interests while adhering to budget constraints and corporate guidelines, sometimes pushing back on features proposed by Marketing and the Industrial Designer.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation around criteria derived from user requirements, marketing reports, and the company's marketing strategy. The specific criteria included:\n\n*   **User Requirements:** Meeting basic needs for operating a TV.\n*   **Trends:** Fashionable look and feel, including spongy texture and fruit/vegetable-inspired design colors.\n*   **Technological Innovation:** Incorporating new technology like voice recognition.\n*   **Ease of Use:** Simple and intuitive design.\n*   **Ergonomics:** Design minimizing repetitive strain injury (RSI).\n*   **Locatability:** Easy to find, potentially through a beeper function.\n*   **Company Strategy:** Alignment with company's focus on quality, technology, and environmental safety.\n\nMarketing proposed a seven-point scale for evaluating each criterion, with the team members providing individual ratings and then averaging them. They also considered whether the product met specifications and if any modifications were needed before prototyping and marketing.\n",
    "The transcription status involves several aspects. IBM is conducting transcriptions using a new beep format to facilitate alignment. The goal is to have 20 hours of data for a DARPA demo. Transcribers are being trained to use visual representations of segments and are also doing digit extraction. There's discussion about incorporating digits directly into transcripts. A new version of pre-segmentation has been developed, using channel-specific speech/non-speech detection. \n\nRegarding recordings, the SmartKom group is collecting dialogues, and there's a discussion on whether to include this data in the corpus. Concerns about disk space are also being addressed.\n\nIntermediate categories involve identifying and filtering ASI references, handling acronyms, and encoding clarificational material. Jane suggested the idea of having extra tiers/channels for sounds like breaths or door slams that are not specific to any speaker.\n",
    "In the Stage 2 proceedings, the Deputy Minister introduced amendments 1 and 4 to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness regarding the changes to the law. She argued against amendments 1A to 1E, stating they were unnecessary and risked overemphasizing specific groups.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2 for a post-implementation review, influenced by a committee recommendation. She opposed amendment 2C, which called for a report on the awareness campaign before section 1 commenced, deeming it unnecessary and conflicting with the implementation timeline.\n\nConcerning regulation-making powers, during discussions on amendment 3, the Deputy Minister addressed the power to make transitory, transitional, or saving provisions. While she didn't believe wider powers were necessary, she committed to keeping the matter under review and discussing it further before Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion on long-term trends focused on the need for a curriculum that is broader than specific qualifications and a shift in the paradigm for resources, moving away from a focus on qualifications and towards the curriculum. Philip Blaker emphasized that qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive it.\n\nPhilip Blaker outlined Qualification Wales' role as the regulator of awarding bodies, focusing on qualification design and assessment delivery. He also mentioned their involvement in maintaining standards and ensuring fair grading. According to Blaker, they prescribe comparable outcomes during periods of change to ensure fairness in grading. He also noted that their role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms necessary for the new curriculum to ensure sufficient time for system readiness.\n\nRegarding the lack of exams, the discussion highlighted a go/no-go decision point in 2023, where Qualifications Wales would assess whether the conditions are right for safe implementation of new qualifications. If not, they would recommend delaying the qualification reforms by a year to allow the system to catch up.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal a discussion about the difficulties of implementing good practice across Wales in early childhood education and care. The Deputy Minister acknowledges the complexity of the current system, which has evolved from various programs, and the need for simplification. Pathfinder projects are underway in eight local authorities to explore ways of joining up the system.\n\nA key challenge is the variance in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales, influenced by local authority decisions and historical factors. While quality is generally good, consistency is lacking. The Welsh Government aims to address this by testing consistent funding rates and encouraging the development of facilities in each local authority to meet local needs.\n\nThe discussion also touches on the childcare offer, with concerns raised about its impact and whether it truly incentivizes parents to enter the workforce. There are issues around take-up rates in different areas and whether funding matches demand. The Welsh Government plans to extend the offer and is reviewing its criteria, including the inclusion of parents in training and education. The Welsh language skills of the childcare workforce and the need for upskilling are also highlighted.\n",
    "The discussion on components and interfaces for the remote control revolved around several key aspects. For the case material, initial ideas like rubber and titanium were discarded due to heat and manufacturing constraints. Wood was considered due to its environmentally friendly nature and potential for custom designs. However, the latest market research indicates the younger target group prefers spongy, colorful materials, aligning with a fruit or vegetable theme. A banana or pear shape with a spongy cover was proposed for ergonomic reasons.\n\nRegarding the interface design, the team aimed for simplicity and ease of use, considering the potential for voice recognition and tactile feedback. The team decided to use a wheel control. The buttons would be placed on the side, within easy reach of the thumb, and potentially lighted for better visibility. The team decided to go with a simple design that did not include an LCD screen.\n",
    "Professor B's thoughts on the final model were centered around the need to analyze the kinds of errors being made, rather than just noting that certain changes didn't improve the overall performance. He suggested that some changes might improve performance in certain areas, while worsening it in others.\n\nThe discussion covered several aspects of time series analysis. One point of discussion revolved around whitening the data by adding white noise, which could potentially normalize the noise across training and testing sets. There was also a mention of Taylor series expansion in the context of phase normalization, and complex arithmetic as a means of addressing phase issues.\n\nRegarding reverberation, Professor A mentioned that the visual demonstration of the effects of reverberation on the website was flawed, as the noise present was identifiable and easily removable five hertz noise rather than reverberation. Several participants suggested using a high-pass filter to remove noise from cheap microphones.\n\nFinally, when pronouncing zero, there was a strange shape to the trajectory of C-one, where the mean for the silence portion could be different depending on the noise.",
    "The group extensively discussed the introduction of a new remote control project, covering various aspects.\n\n**Concept Decisions:** The consensus was to develop a universal remote control that works with multiple devices, targeting a broad consumer base. Simplicity and user-friendliness were prioritized, with an emphasis on reducing the number of buttons to those most frequently used.\n\n**Universal Remote:** Interoperability and the ability to control various devices (TVs, DVD players, etc.) were deemed essential. The team explored different communication methods, including infrared and Bluetooth, with considerations for cost-effectiveness and range.\n\n**Parental Control:** The team considered child-friendly interfaces with minimal buttons, and explored the idea of channel locks.\n\n**Games:** There was no discussion of games.\n\n**Voice Recognition:** Voice recognition emerged as a potential \"star feature,\" with the possibility of recording user voices for specific functions. However, concerns were raised about the cost and reliability of voice recognition technology. The placement of the voice receiver (remote vs. TV) was also discussed.\n",
    "The group discussed the increasing suicide rates among children and young people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaughan Gething stated that the government commissioned a review, through the delivery unit working with the national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths during the pandemic's start. The review aimed to understand if restrictions on mental health and well-being were leading to a spike in suicides. Gething expected a report by the end of the month, which would be shared with the committee. He assured the committee that crisis care services for children and young people remained available.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Gething mentioned hosting a roundtable with the NSPCC and highlighted the government's efforts to ensure consistent perinatal support for women across Wales. Support was being provided via phone or online where possible, and the commitment to create in-patient capacity remained, although the pandemic had caused interruptions. Gething acknowledged a decrease in women seeking mother and baby unit provision due to fear and lockdown concerns, but emphasized that this would not influence planning for the facility's need.",
    "The implementation work is scheduled to be finished by January 2020, with the final version of the curriculum published at that time.\n\nThe meeting transcript does not include any discussion about the risk of losing focus.\n\nThere was discussion around making improvements to the curriculum to better explain, simplify, or provide greater depth where needed, but the overall concept would not have any significant changes.\n\nThe meeting did not include any discussion regarding networking within the PRU or transition arrangements.",
    "The group had varying opinions on infra-red functionality. The industrial designer stated that infra-red is not really \"hot technical stuff anymore,\" but also pointed out that it is cost-effective. The user interface designer agreed that it's a bit old-fashioned, but noted that all TVs are equipped with it. They suggested using both infra-red and Bluetooth in one remote.\n\nRegarding disposable income, the industrial designer suggested that the target audience for the remote should be younger people with disposable income to spend on technology. The marketing expert agreed that younger people would likely have the money to buy the remote. The user interface designer wondered if voice recognition could be included without compromising the production cost limit.\n",
    "The group believes that eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is the best available measure for identifying pupils to target, but it is not perfect. Some members recognize the need for a more focused approach but acknowledge the absence of a better alternative. They are exploring the impact of universal credit on identifying relative need.\n \nRegarding the impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement for children receiving FSM, the group acknowledges improvements in attendance but notes a persistent gap between FSM pupils and their non-FSM counterparts. They discuss examples of schools using PDG to address attendance issues, such as walking buses and family support workers. The group recognizes the need for more effective interventions, especially for older children, and emphasizes a multi-agency approach to address barriers to attendance and engagement.\n",
    "The professor does not specifically discuss support vector machines in the provided transcripts. However, a graduate student, grad a, mentions tinkering with support vector machines for a class project, comparing them to recurrent neural nets used by King and Taylor for recognizing phonological features from MFCCs.\n\nRegarding speech rate algorithms, the professor's thoughts are not directly stated. However, there is a discussion about improving the speed of the system by reducing latencies. The professor suggests that a quarter-second delay is likely unnoticeable to users. The group considers ways to cut down on neural net time, potentially by adjusting the look-ahead or using asymmetric approaches. They also discuss spectral subtraction from Ericsson as a way to remove noise.",
    "The professor believes there are a lot of acoustic events besides overlapping zones. Some examples of acoustic events are breaths, aspirations, talk, and claps. He doesn't feel the need to label each acoustic event, but he would like to study if he can find good parameters to detect overlapping. He would like to test the parameters with other acoustic events to determine the false hypothesis.\n\nThe professor also considers the silent parts of speech to be acoustic events because he would like to do a stylistic study. He wants to give a report from the study from the session.",
    "The team extensively discussed the user interface design of the remote control, focusing on simplicity and user-friendliness. Market research indicated that users find current remotes too complex, using only a fraction of the available buttons. A key decision was to prioritize a simple design with fewer buttons, primarily focusing on channel and volume control.\n\nThe team explored various design elements to enhance usability, including a wheel for incremental channel and volume adjustments, a backlight for visibility in the dark, and potentially a protective cover for less frequently used buttons. The team decided against including an LCD screen, voice recognition, and multi-function capabilities to expedite the development process and maintain simplicity. The final design will incorporate the company's logo and colors to align with branding requirements.\n",
    "The project manager seems to be concerned with the overall look and feel of the remote control. They appreciated the idea of changeable covers and custom designs, as this allows for individual taste while manufacturing only one basic product. The project manager was in favor of keeping the rubber material because it has more advantages than the color yellow and offers a squishy feeling, making it different from existing remote controls. They also thought it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world. During the evaluation, the project manager noted that the type of button that they were going to use in the bottom half, the material, minimizes R_S_I_. The project manager also stated that with the size that they had, it was quite small, but with the amount of stuff they were putting on it, it wasn't that much.\n",
    "The discussion on fixing the system and improving the baseline involved several approaches. One key area was improving the voice activity detector (VAD). The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a new baseline with MFCC features and a VAD, aiming for a 50% improvement. Experiments were conducted to compare different VADs, including French, OGI, and Alcatel VADs, with the French VAD showing promising results. There was also discussion about whether the VAD should only use baseline features or if other features, such as pitch detection, could be incorporated.\n\nAnother focus was on noise compensation techniques, particularly spectral subtraction. The team explored different spectral subtraction approaches and their impact on the system's performance. They also investigated the use of on-line normalization in conjunction with spectral subtraction, noting that it didn't always improve results and might even be detrimental.\n\nThe team also talked about improving the system through vocal tract length normalization and MLLR transformations. Finally, the team also discussed the possibility of a CVS over the web.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on various critical issues. Regarding legislation, there were concerns about Bill C-7, which removes safeguards related to medical assistance in dying, and calls to pass Bill S-204 to combat organ harvesting. There were also discussions on firearms legislation and regulations.\n\nIn terms of economic support, the discussions covered support for sports infrastructural construction, government aid for energy resources, tourism, green economy, and small businesses. The impact of COVID-19 on fishing, tourism, oil, and gas was a recurring theme, with specific attention to lobster fisheries, seafood harvesters, and the energy sector. The discussions also included financial assistance to Canadian airlines, support for seniors, the homeless, and Indigenous communities.\n\nThe transcripts also show discussion about the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), and concerns about potential fraud, eligibility criteria, and the need for work incentives. Tax avoidance by large corporations was also discussed.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the remote control's design and functionality. Initially, they aimed for a user-oriented, simple design with limited buttons, possibly using a two-piece design. They considered a \"fancy look-and-feel\" to subtly trick consumers into perceiving it as modern and sleek, even if the shape remained somewhat traditional.\n\nThe team explored personalization options, including removable covers with different themes (like fruits/vegetables) to appeal to different demographics. A novel shape, such as a fruit or vegetable, was considered but met with reservations, particularly regarding male consumers. The idea of a spongy material was also discussed, potentially achieved with a mobile phone-like cover.\n\nThe final decision leaned towards a plastic casing, potentially with rubber grips in certain areas. They decided against a fruit shape but considered incorporating company colors. The team agreed on the inclusion of an LCD screen and a scroll wheel, similar to an iPod, which would require a more expensive chip.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed different colors, specifically lemon or lime, for the product due to an emerging fashion trend that associates clothes and furniture with fruits and vegetables. The market research also revealed that consumers prefer remote controls with a fancy look and feel, so the team wanted the product to be fashionable. The use of lemon or lime, as well as green colors, was intended to create a coherent theme that would unify the product's shape, materials, and overall marketing identity. The idea was to incorporate these features into something almost gimmicky, such as lighting within the device, to contribute to the look and feel of innovation.\n",
    "The overall conclusion regarding the remote control's design is a move towards simplification and user-friendliness, particularly with a focus on the 40+ demographic. Market research indicates that users primarily use a small percentage of buttons (around 10%), suggesting a reduction in the number of buttons and a focus on essential functions like channel and volume control.\n\nTo minimize repetitive strain injury (RSI), ergonomic considerations are important, with the industrial designer suggesting a comfortable grip with buttons easily accessible. The possibility of voice control is explored, potentially catering to a younger demographic while simplifying the interface for older users. The inclusion of teletext is debated, primarily for accessibility reasons. The team is considering a rounded design that fits comfortably in the hand.\n",
    "Assessments on the future of institutions involved discussions on potential university mergers, with the Cabinet Secretary expressing a preference for a healthy, strong, and sustainable higher education sector. While not actively pursuing mergers, the government would consider them if institutions found it beneficial for their students, ensuring robust plans are in place.\n\nDiscussions on women's issues included addressing the underrepresentation of women in specific fields, particularly in teaching Welsh. The Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning emphasized the need to build confidence in Welsh speakers to teach through the medium of Welsh.\n\nThe committee's statements on housing included concerns about student accommodation costs. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) is analyzing data to assess cost increases, and universities are investing in student support activities, including bursaries for accommodation.\n\nMembers' discussions covered topics such as teacher training, post-16 education reforms, and the impact of potential funding cuts on part-time provision. Concerns were raised about the financial sustainability of the higher education sector and the need for greater parity of esteem between academic and vocational education. The committee also discussed the importance of addressing mental health and well-being for students.\n",
    "The discussion about meeting digits primarily revolves around data collection, analysis of overlaps in speech, and related technical aspects.\n\n*   **Data Collection and Analysis:** The group discusses recording meetings, transcribing data, and analyzing overlaps in speech. Jane presents a preliminary analysis of overlaps in a meeting, looking at the distribution of overlaps and individual differences in speaking styles.\n\n*   **Technical Aspects:** There's a discussion about using close-talking microphones for speech segmentation, and the challenges involved in identifying speaker changes and dealing with overlaps in mixed audio files. Alternative approaches, such as using neural networks or acoustic change detection algorithms, are also considered.\n\n*   **Human Subject Considerations:** The group touches upon the importance of anonymizing data and obtaining informed consent from meeting participants. There's also a discussion about the possibility of allowing participants to request audio pixelization (beeping out parts of their speech) to address privacy concerns.",
    "The marketing expert, user interface designer, and industrial designer all see value in recommending a speech recognition interface for the new remote control. The marketing expert notes that surveys indicate a high percentage (75-90%) of the 15-35 year old demographic are willing to pay more for speech recognition. The marketing expert believes that speech recognition will make the product trendy and fancy. The industrial designer suggests that the user can train the device to reduce the cost and complexity of the speech recognition. The user interface designer believes it would be a good marketing gimmick if it could filter out ambient TV sounds and speech. It is also seen as a unique selling point and a way to differentiate the product from competitors. The team sees the voice recognition feature as unusual and marketable.\n",
    "The discussion on consortia in the meetings is not present within the provided document. There is no mention of attitudes, opinions, the role of regional consortia, the Cabinet Secretary, Jassa Scott, or the Auditor General.\n\nSimilarly, the document does not contain information about Bill Blair's response to the firearms seizure issue at Pearson airport or any proposed measures for ensuring social stability.\n\nThe political background of the group appears to be the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. The aim of the committee is to address issues related to the pandemic, as well as other concerns brought forward by members of Parliament on behalf of their constituents.\n",
    "The team discussed the remote's functions extensively. A key frustration identified was users frequently losing their remotes, leading to the suggestion of a tracking device. The idea was for the remote to emit a beep when a button was pressed, aiding in locating it. Project evaluation revealed that many users only utilized a small percentage of the buttons, prompting a discussion on simplifying the remote and potentially hiding less frequently used buttons under a flip cover.\n\nBrainstorming new functions included speech recognition, with younger users expressing interest. However, concerns were raised about its practicality, including ambient noise interference and the need for extensive training. Other ideas included making the remote unbreakable and waterproof. The team also explored the possibility of a remote that could change size depending on the user's preference, through an inflatable design. Ultimately, the focus shifted towards prioritizing user-friendliness and a sleek, modern appearance.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the group considered special colors for the buttons. The user interface designer mentioned using a \"foggy yellow\" that would light up when pressed, and a prominent red button for power and confirmation.\n\nMarketing's dissatisfaction stemmed from cost-cutting measures. To meet the budget, the team considered removing colors from the buttons, which Marketing opposed. The goal was to create a stylish product, and Marketing felt that simplifying the button design and potentially removing color differentiation would compromise the remote's high-end appeal. Marketing suggested exploring alternative button shapes to maintain visual interest while reducing costs associated with multiple colors.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, here are the key points regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension, employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales:\n\n**Welsh Dimension:**\nThere is a need for more Welsh-medium teachers and a concern about the drop-off in Welsh language use post-16. Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol is working to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, focusing on building confidence and skills among Welsh speakers.\n\n**Employers' Understanding of the Welsh Bac:**\nMany employers do not fully understand the Welsh Baccalaureate. Employers' voices were involved in the qualification's development, and many employers value the skills developed through the baccalaureate. There's a need for better communication with employers about the qualification's nature and value.\n\n**Independent Body for Inspecting in Wales:**\nThe Education Workforce Council (EWC) is an independent body responsible for the accreditation of teacher training programs. The Welsh Ministers are independent of the qualification system, so they are careful about what they say, because it is for the WJEC and Qualifications Wales to regulate. There is an appeals process that may be being undertaken.\n",
    "The group generally agreed that presentation materials were convenient for conveying ideas and information. However, there were some issues with the use of the materials. The group felt the whiteboard was helpful, but not as useful as it could have been. The PowerPoint was too much of a focus, and that the whiteboard could be cooler than the PowerPoint. The digital pens were clunky and took some getting used to. The computers were distracting, and too many computers were in the room. Overall, the group felt that the presentation materials were helpful, but there was room for improvement.",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays due to several factors. Firstly, the industrial designer noted that if the remote was designed with a \"squishy\" or spongy feel (in line with current fashion trends), an LCD screen might be affected by the movement. Secondly, an LCD screen would necessitate a more advanced and expensive chip. Finally, the user interface designer pointed out that with current technology, there was no way to get information back from the television to display on the remote's screen, limiting the usefulness of an LCD. The team favored a simpler, more durable design, prioritizing features like a scroll wheel (initially) and a cradle for charging and locating the remote.\n",
    "**Self-Introduction:**\n\nShrida Daseri is the project manager. Agnes is the user interface designer. Ed is responsible for marketing. Christine is the industrial designer.\n\n**Project Introduction:**\n\nThe initial project goal was to create a remote control for televisions. However, there was confusion, as some team members believed the project was to design a new monitor or market coffee. The ultimate goal is to design a new remote control that is easy to use and visually appealing.\n\n**Brainstorming Process:**\n\nThe team brainstormed ideas for the remote control's design, functionality, and marketing. Suggestions included a snowman shape, rubber buttons, kinetic power, an L_C_D_ screen, a jog-dial, and a catchy slogan. They also discussed potential advanced functions like brightness, contrast, and pre-programmed sound modes. The team evaluated the product. The team also discussed the goal of the project, to refine the design and revisit the original goals.\n\n**Project Evaluation:**\n\nThe team evaluated the project based on a set of criteria, including design goals and market research. They used a consensus system to rate the project on a scale of one to seven, with one being high and seven being low. The evaluation covered aspects like fashion trends, style, technology, and cost.\n\n**Project Process:**\n\nThe project process involved initial meetings to define the product and assign responsibilities. The team members were expected to work independently and report back their ideas in subsequent meetings. There was an emphasis on documenting plans and designs in writing. The project manager coordinated the teams and ensured everyone was kept in the loop. The team evaluated the project and looked for ways to improve the project.\n",
    "The team briefly considered rechargeable units, specifically solar power and a \"basic bateer battery\" where moving the device provides energy. However, the team quickly dismissed solar power due to its unreliability in less sunny climates. The \"bateer battery\" was also dismissed due to the team's concern that consumers would not want to wind up their remote control before use. Ultimately, the team decided that the basic battery was the best option, but not very exciting. Later in the meetings when the team discussed the possibility of including a touch screen, the project manager mentioned that the team would have to see some kind of new battery technology because they did not think anyone would buy a remote that they had to plug in.\n",
    "The decision regarding the procedures and nonuniformity of microphones was that the group will proceed with a digital filter suggested by Dan, rather than changing the capacitor on the input box. The group also decided to check whether Feacalc is being used with the high-pass filter option. Additionally, they agreed to ensure the filtering is done before processing if cheap microphones are used, noting that the PZM microphones do not require this. The group also decided that the visual demonstration on the webpage should be changed to demonstrate the effects of reverberation, and the spectrogram will be zoomed in on an interesting area.",
    "Meilyr Rowlands stated that Estyn has been working to ensure standards do not slip during educational reform. He noted secondary schools face a greater challenge than primary schools in preparing for the new curriculum and said more money should be allocated to the education system and that secondary schools are in deficit. He noted the importance of teachers and that recruitment is getting more difficult.\n\nKirsty Williams AM discussed the importance of ensuring the emotional and mental well-being of children and young people is supported. She stated that during a prolonged period of closure, school staff would be doing check-ins with students. She also said that concerns around the capacity of online counselling were being reviewed.",
    "During the detailed design discussion, the Industrial Designer focused on the look and feel of the new spherical remote control. They acknowledged the need to balance the aesthetic design with functional restrictions. The Industrial Designer considered the practicality of a ball shape, noting that it would likely need a flat side to prevent rolling.\n\nThe Industrial Designer raised concerns about the durability of the remote, questioning whether it should be built to last or designed for more frequent replacement. They also questioned the practicality of a hinged design, suggesting it might be prone to breaking. The Industrial Designer emphasized the need to strike a compromise between stability and design, acknowledging the limitations of a traditional rectangular remote but struggling to find an innovative alternative. They also pointed out that a one-handed design may be too small to be functional.\n",
    "Based on the transcripts, the group has concerns about the existing Erasmus program and mobility funding for students, particularly in the context of Brexit. There is worry that Wales is losing its competitive edge in attracting EU students due to changes in funding policies, and that the Anglocentric nature of the UK media may impact recruitment.\n\nRegarding tuition fee refunds, the group does not discuss the question of whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees.\n",
    "The meetings addressed local authoritative frameworks through petitions and member statements. For example, one petition requested recognition of Somaliland as an autonomous state. Condolences were offered to families who lost loved ones, including those who died at sea, front-line attendants who died during the pandemic, and former parliamentarians.\n\nEmployment was discussed in the context of the Canada Summer Jobs program, with concerns raised about funding delays, eligibility criteria, and the program's effectiveness. There were also discussions about the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and concerns raised that the Liberal Party was taking advantage of the program, while small businesses struggled to meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nWorker safety was discussed in relation to workplace safety during the pandemic and the right to refuse unsafe work. There were also questions about safety in long-term care facilities and the conditions of work.\n\nPay dispute situations were raised regarding airlines refusing to reimburse customers for cancelled flights and the difficulty in accessing the emergency wage subsidy. There were also discussions about wage supplements for essential workers.\n",
    "From Whitehorse, thanks were expressed to the House of Commons and the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for their efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Deputy Prime Minister noted the importance of the Canadian Armed Forces, who are doing an important and excellent job in Quebec and Ontario today, right now. In addition, the Canadian Armed Forces are in Quebec today at the request of the Province of Quebec to save the lives of seniors.\n",
    "The group discussed the functions, characters, and design requirements of a remote control. The primary function is to send messages to the TV for basic operations like power, channel, volume, and mute. The team also considered additional functions such as play, rewind, and fast-forward, as well as menu options for brightness and screen settings.\n\nThe group explored speech recognition as an up-and-coming feature and discussed the trade-offs between simple and complex designs, and modern and user-friendly designs. The marketing team's research indicated that users are willing to pay more for a remote control that is snazzy and simple.\n\nThe discussion prioritized the need for user-friendly buttons, with consideration for larger buttons and fewer overall buttons. The possibility of a \"homing device\" was raised to help users find lost remotes, potentially through a charging base that could trigger a beep. A scroll feature was also proposed as a potential way to navigate channels.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion revolve around the design, functionality, and marketing of a new universal TV remote control. The project manager is trying to gather functional and technical designs, marketing strategies, and budget estimates from the team.\n\nFor the upcoming team meeting, the Industrial Designer is expected to consider the basic functions of the remote, while the User Interface Designer will focus on user needs and preferences. They will discuss what users want versus what is feasible, considering trade-offs. Initial ideas included a touchscreen, multi-format compatibility, and a locator device.\n\nMarketing's views on repetitive strain injury (RSI) are not mentioned in the text. The team also brainstormed about potential problems with the remote, such as losing a pen used for a touchscreen, but they have not reflected on the progress or problems from previous meetings.\n",
    "The lab tests led to the team deciding on using rubber for the buttons, aluminum for battery contacts, an integrated circuit, an LED, contact discs for the buttons, and plastic for the casing. The team discussed the possibility of a voice-activated locator, but were concerned it would require a more substantial chip and be too sensitive. They also considered a \"finder\" button. They agreed to go with a smaller remote with a locating device, which they felt was more advanced. The team discussed the design and location of the buttons, with some favoring raised buttons and others scroll buttons on the side. It was decided that the scroll buttons should be labeled. The team also discussed the material for the case and buttons, with the final decision being a plastic base with latex covers.\n\nRegarding the presentation connecting the project with market interests, the team agreed that the design should be biomorphic (round, not square), and the buttons should be soft. They also agreed that the look, feel, and shape were the most important features from a marketing perspective, more so than functionality, as those are what customers will experience in the store before buying. They also noted that the size should be small. The team did not agree on lighting adaptive options during the presentation.\n",
    "The team discussed several topics, including DAT, power cables, and capturing subject intention, as well as approaches for analysis. \n\nDAT: It was mentioned that the team is sending data to IBM on CD-ROM, which will be transferred to analog tape for transcription. The team will provide all sixteen channels, and IBM will decide what to do with it.\n\nPower Cables: This is mentioned in a list with PDAs, PDMs, and PZAs. The Jimlets will eventually be mounted under the table once the room is more organized.\n\nCapturing Subject Intention: The team discussed inferring intentions from features in context. Data is collected in a room with a three-D model, or a QuickTime animation of standing in a square in Heidelberg, and participants are told that a new computer system can tell them everything they want to know. They then solve tasks by interacting with the computer system.\n\nApproaches for Analysis: The team discussed using a belief net to determine the conditional probability of the person wanting to view, enter, or tango with the object. This is a toy system to play around with to get a clearer notion of what input is needed.",
    "The group extensively discussed the general specifications and case design for the remote control. The industrial designer presented a design concept with changeable faces, allowing for customization with various colors and patterns, potentially incorporating trendy fruit and vegetable-inspired colors. The changeable cases would allow users to customize the look and feel of the remote, aligning with current fashion trends.\n\nHowever, the team decided against including voice recognition in the initial design due to cost concerns, opting to potentially offer it as an upgraded feature for a business-class version. They also debated the use of kinetic batteries versus standard batteries. The team agreed to a design that met the specification of a sales price of twenty-five Euro, with a production price of twelve and a half Euro.\n\nChanges in the current design involved removing the voice recognition feature to meet the initial cost specifications. The team also explored different materials for the case, considering factors like durability, feel, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately leaning towards a design that balanced functionality, aesthetics, and marketability.\n",
    "Huw David did not appear to express any specific views on the unintended consequences of the Bill, the need for legislation in light of changing natural behavior and culture, and whether it should be explicitly stated in the Bill. He did say that if the Bill is implemented carefully with the right resources, then he hopes that there will be no unintended consequences. However, he said that it is important to make sure that resources are made available, because children's social services are overstretched. He also said that he welcomes and understands the need to progress this piece of legislation.\n",
    "The group had varying opinions on the design and functionality of the two-sided remote control.\n\n**Evaluation and Market Range:** The marketing expert suggested that 80% of users are willing to spend more money for a fancier remote. The group agreed the remote should appeal to all age ranges, from kids to adults.\n\n**Technical Requirements:** There was a discussion about whether the remote should be waterproof, with some suggesting it could be sold with a plastic cover or waterproof box. The industrial designer suggested a button on the TV to make the remote beep when lost. The team also considered whether to use infrared or radio waves, with radio waves offering broader usability but potentially interfering with other devices. They also considered speech recognition, with younger users being more interested in this feature.\n",
    "The discussions in group 3 centered on amendments related to the regulation-making powers within the Bill. The Deputy Minister proposed an amendment to provide certainty on the commencement date of the core provision, abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment. This involved technical adjustments, including adding an existing power back onto the face of the Bill and bringing the power into force shortly after Royal Assent.\n\nSuzy Davies introduced amendment 3A as a probing measure, questioning whether the \"transitory, transitional and saving provisions\" were sufficient regulatory powers. She suggested that the Deputy Minister might need broader powers to make regulations for implementing Section 1, especially considering the Bill's evolution. Davies proposed this to ensure the Assembly could scrutinize anything introduced under Section 1. She described it as a holding position to be revisited at Stage 3 after further discussion on the necessary powers. The Deputy Minister responded that she did not think wider powers were necessary but would keep the matter under review and was happy to discuss it further before Stage 3.\n",
    "Brexit has led to a decrease in EU student applications in Wales, contrasting with increases in England. The change in student support arrangements is a contributing factor. Universities are addressing this by enhancing their marketing efforts through the \"Global Wales\" program, emphasizing safety and supportiveness. Fee and access plans are being utilized to protect student mobility, and institutions are working to maintain access to research funding. Executives are confident in the robust planning of HEIs for various Brexit scenarios.\n\nQuestions arose about the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks. This questioning is not present in this transcript.\n\nThere is also no mention of the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada within this transcript.\n",
    "The key points regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada are as follows:\n\n*   **Financial Support for Seniors:** There is an expressed need to increase financial support for seniors, especially those on fixed incomes, to help with rising costs and scarcity of services during the pandemic. Proposed measures include increasing old age security and allowing seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSPs without penalties.\n*   **Concerns About Long-Term Care:** The transcripts highlight horror stories and appalling conditions in long-term care homes (CHSLDs) across the country. There are calls for national standards of care, increased federal leadership, and investigations into potential criminal conduct and negligence in these facilities. The role of for-profit care is questioned, and there is discussion about removing profit incentives from long-term care.\n*   **Vulnerable People Falling Through the Cracks:** Concerns are raised about vulnerable people, including those who didn't meet the $5,000 income threshold, not qualifying for benefits. The government is urged to remove restrictive eligibility criteria and ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind.\n*   **Community Organizations:** Community Organizations are providing support to vulnerable seniors.\n*   **Disability Support:** There is discussion of a one-time payment for those with disabilities, however, there are questions about whether the support is adequate and reaches all those with disabilities.\n*   **Support for Indigenous Communities:** There is a need to support First Nations communities to keep COVID-19 out of their communities.",
    "The marketing expert believes user identification and the product should focus on young people. They suggest incorporating speech recognition and understanding user behavior.

    "The main points discussed regarding the universal adoption of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 were its four main objectives: regulating institutions, safeguarding the contribution to public good from financial support, focusing on fair access, and protecting institutional autonomy.\n\nAdvantages of the Act included providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers for non-compliance. The Act also allowed the government to progress agendas through the remit letter and relationships with HEFCW, such as signing institutions up to the living wage and the code of ethical procurement.\n\nWeaknesses of the Act included the inflexibility and cumbersomeness of HEFCW's powers, which made swift interventions difficult. The Act focused on individual institutions and did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access. There were also concerns about the effectiveness of fee and access plans, as they focused on inputs rather than outcomes. The governance of universities was also seen as a problem, with concerns about the diversity of governing bodies.",
    "The group discussed the evaluation criteria for the remote control prototype. The marketing expert presented the criteria, which were based on user requirements and market trends from previous meetings. The criteria included factors such as a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, fashion, easy to find, and robustness. Each member was asked to rate the project on a scale, with one being high and seven being low.\n\nThe group went through each criterion, discussing and voting on a rating. For example, the project received varying scores for its \"fancy look and feel,\" with some members suggesting it was basic. The \"fashionable\" aspect received a higher score due to the fruit shape. Robustness was also rated favorably due to the rubber material. Overall, the group aimed for a product that scored well and remained within budget.\n\nLater, the marketing expert presented a design evaluation, where the group reviewed the design goals and market research to assess the current plan. The goal was to use a consensus system to determine if the project was on track.\n",
    "The participants generally agreed that a single curved design would be best. The industrial designer expressed that equal-sized, round buttons with logos would be ideal. The project manager suggested discarding the help and mute buttons, but the user interface member stated these buttons could be combined with the volume and channel. The marketing member proposed integrating three of the number buttons into one. The user interface and industrial designer members stated the LCD screen would require an advanced chip. The project manager suggested using a scroll wheel for program numbers, but the marketing member stated this might not be suitable for older people. The marketing member stated the price of the remote could be raised due to the docking station.",
    "The team decided against positioning symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote due to concerns about usability. While it could offer design options and cater to both right- and left-handed users, the consensus was that it would complicate the ease of use.\n\nDuring the prototype presentation, the Project Manager suggested creating a right- and left-handed remote. The team seemed to dismiss the idea, believing the functions were basic enough that handedness wouldn't be an issue. The User Interface representative mentioned that most things are designed for right-handed people.\n",
    "The group discussed cost reduction strategies for their remote control design. Due to budget constraints, they considered abandoning certain features to lower production costs. One major point of contention was the inclusion of an LCD screen, which significantly increased the overall cost. Sacrificing the LCD would allow for a more ergonomic design with a rubber casing, but it was seen as a key selling point and innovative feature.\n\nThe group also explored alternative materials like plastic for the case to reduce expenses. They debated whether to retain articulation in the design, which would add to the cost. They also reluctantly decided to remove the locator feature due to its cost. The team weighed the importance of different features and the potential impact on the product's marketability and target audience. Ultimately, they opted for a less expensive plastic casing to retain the LCD screen.\n",
    "The pros of voice recognition mentioned in the meeting include the potential for transcribers to add an extra dimension to their skill set, making the work more interesting and contributing to a more complete transcript. The voice recognition can incorporate numbers directly into the transcript. Voice recognition can improve the speed of transcript creation.\n\nThe cons of voice recognition include that it can be difficult, even for connected digits, and the prosodics are different. Grouping in digits is different than in normal speech. There can be false starts, misreads, and miscues. The models may not be that good. It can be hard to go from a dictionary pronunciation to a gestural one. In some cases, features are not synchronous.",
    "The Industrial Designer (I.D.) discussed several battery options for the remote control. They mentioned basic rechargeable batteries (but noted they need to be recharged and are bulky), hand-powered dynamos (like old torches, manually charged), kinetic energy (shake to charge), and solar power (potentially not useful indoors).\n\nThe I.D. favored kinetic energy because it provides instant energy without needing to be plugged in or placed in sunlight. They also mentioned the possibility of solar power as a backup. The team decided on kinetic energy with the possibility of solar power as a backup and watch-type batteries. They also decided on the type of chip that would be needed based on the lighting system.\n\nThe I.D. also recommended rubber casing for anti-RSI benefits and aesthetic choices. They suggested a rubber coating or sleeve over a plastic case for design flexibility and protection. They also decided on plastic for the body of the remote with rubber as padding or for the grip. The team decided to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber cover.\n",
    "The conference paper was included for several reasons. First, the project is a database collection effort, and the conference paper would describe that effort. Second, the project team wanted to collect more information that could be useful later for user interface design. Third, it was a proof of concept. Finally, the project was related to Landay's work, so the conference paper would help to make his work easier.\n",

They also discussed NIST coming to see the room and a demonstration of the modified multitrans. There was also discussion regarding potential video recordings of meetings.\n",
    "The last meeting primarily focused on two main topics: data collection and user interface design. During the discussion on data collection, the group explored different ways to gather information that would be helpful for user interface design, especially for querying. They considered using CrossPads for note-taking, but the poor handwriting recognition was a concern. There was also a discussion about generating queries automatically and how to generate queries from meeting summaries. \n\nThe key problem identified was how to effectively generate queries for the system, as there was a lack of real-world examples to work from. The group discussed various approaches, including using experts to listen to meetings, identifying keywords, and asking meeting participants to summarize the meeting and identify interesting points. However, they acknowledged the challenges of motivating people to do extra work and avoiding bias in the generated queries. Ultimately, they decided to focus on collecting summaries and using them to bootstrap the query generation process.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns regarding the childcare offer.\n\nFee: They questioned whether the \u00a34.50 single national rate would lead to a two-tiered system, with wealthier parents able to afford better care through add-ons.\n\nAccess Plans: There was concern about the intensity of demand for services not being spread evenly across early adopter areas and whether this would cause problems across Wales.\n\nAffordability: The impact on lowest-income working families was highlighted, particularly regarding additional charges for items like transport and food.\n\nPilots: They questioned whether the \u00a34.50 rate would work in more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport and whether capacity would be an issue.\n\nWorkforce: They questioned whether there would be sufficient capacity growth in the foundational sector to deliver the product and provide the level of staffing needed.\n\nQuality: There was concern regarding the quality of childcare while maintaining the rate at \u00a34.50.\n",
    "The discussion included discussion of online normalization, spectral subtraction, and the use of variance normalization. PhD C discussed their work on online normalization, particularly with different means for silence and speech and varying time constants. They also mentioned experimenting with adding white noise to smooth out MFCCs.\n\nThe professor suggested examining the types of errors being made to understand if normalizations were helping in some areas but hurting in others. PhD F mentioned trying phase normalization and getting garbage results. Grad G discussed issues with phase normalization, including unwrapping the phase and scaling complex numbers. The professor suggested doing it all with complex arithmetic and not using the polar representation.\n\nRegarding quals, PhD C is doing work on online normalization, and the professor suggested looking at the types of errors being made. Grad A is preparing for their quals and is thinking about using intermediate categories to classify speech.\n",
    "The group discussed articulatory features and how best to detect them. One idea was to model articulatory features with overlap, arguing that a simple mapping from phone to corresponding features isn't sufficient for conversational speech due to overlapping processes like voicing and nasality. However, there was concern that reading digits might not exhibit this phenomenon as much. A suggestion was made to compare a small subset of conversational speech with digits to gauge the difference.\n\nThe discussion shifted to feature streams, envisioning a score-like notation where each line represents a particular feature (e.g., voicing, nasality) with labels and potential overlaps that don't necessarily correspond to phone timings.\n\nThe advantage of using Noisy-ORs was mentioned in the context of a multi-band system that estimates feature values through a combination of gradient learning and EM. This system imagines individual frequency channels providing estimates, with a higher level making sound unit classifications.\n\nFinally, the group talked about including gestural features in the transcription formalization. The goal is to have a representation that is useful to a broad audience, not just those doing specific research. It was suggested to start with an automatic system and then do some manual adjustment. Ultimately, the string that is created will be the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened.",
    "The team discussed system involvement in demos, backups, and collecting notes. \n\nFor demos, there was a discussion on integrating THISL IR and Transcriber, potentially merging their Tcl interfaces and incorporating prosodic visualizations. There was also a discussion on prioritizing what to show, given the time constraints and the desire to showcase prosodic features.\n\nRegarding backups, the team discussed the current setup and the possibility of using non-backed-up disks for Meeting Recorder data. The consensus was that backing up the data is crucial, and they decided to stick with the current backup system and explore options for additional disk space.\n\nFor notes, there were considerations about using CrossPads for note-taking, highlighting interesting points, and synchronizing them with the recording. Some team members found the CrossPads noisy and cumbersome, while others saw potential in their time-tagging capabilities. There was also a PDA idea. Professor B suggested that one of the CrossPads be returned.\n\nProfessor A suggested going around the room at the end of the meeting and asking people to mention something interesting that they learned. Professor D thought summaries were a reasonable bootstrap to discovering queries.",
    "The discussion about HMRC centered on the Welsh Government's decision to discontinue working with them on the childcare offer. Julie Morgan stated that the primary reason for this decision was the desire for a more flexible and expandable offer, which would be restricted by going through HMRC. She explained that bringing in training and education, for example, would not be possible via HMRC and would have to be done by local authorities.\n\nWhile Welsh language standards were also cited as a reason, with concerns raised about HMRC's ability to fully meet them, Morgan emphasized the need for flexibility as the driving factor. Additionally, the costs presented by HMRC were significantly higher than initially outlined, leading to the conclusion that a cheaper and more flexible system could be delivered by working with local authorities.\n",
    "Professor C suggested Keith look at the demo and Robert or Johno could walk him through it. He also suggested the team step back from the applied project and focus on constructions in English and German.\n\nGrad B reported that he went to a linguistics colloquium on fictive motion and that this was relevant to their work. Professor C suggested that Ellen's image schemas would be an important part.\n\nGrad D, along with other participants, gave feedback on the person in Grenada, particularly on the wizard's role, refining tasks, and payroll.\n\nThe required elements in the new form arrangement included bullets, numbering, self-introduction, and switching tasks.\n\nProfessor C stated that Robert had laid out the belief-net, missing only the connections. He and Bhaskara looked at technical questions. Grad E suggested getting the visualization clearer, perhaps with a paper version of the nodes and connections. Grad B questioned how the connections are decided and how to weight things. Grad B thinks that mediocre design will do in the beginning. Grad B suggested it may be best to have a rough representation of the entire belief-net.\nGrad B thinks that the meetings so far have been geared towards the demo.\nGrad B also wanted to mention fictive motion.\nGrad B has been invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva.\nGrad E will come next week with version 0.9 of the structure.\n",
    "Grad E's experiment focused on natural language generation and its integration with speech synthesis. Grad E seemed pleased with the progress, particularly how the CBTs (Concept Bayes Nets) were ordered in the XML, simplifying the stylesheet conversion process. A key goal was to rewrite the German concept syntax-to-prosody rules to improve the system's performance.\n\nGrad A's experiment revolved around content management systems and building a smart FAQ system. Grad A aimed to improve the quality of search results by providing context information, modeling information, and using knowledge about the domain to make inferences. A major challenge was scalability, and Grad A was exploring ways to combine knowledge from different sources, potentially leveraging ideas from the semantic web community. The desired outcome was a system that could provide relevant answers to users' questions by understanding the context in which they were asked.\n",
    "The User Interface team initially favored a remote control design that balanced user-friendliness with functionality, suggesting a programmable interface where users could customize frequently used functions. They drew inspiration from game controllers, proposing a joystick and function buttons with a display to indicate their current actions.\n\nHowever, market research indicated users prioritize simplicity and aesthetics. The final decision leaned towards a minimalist design with a small joystick for basic functions like channel and volume control, an LCD screen for additional features, and very few buttons. A key addition was a \"find me\" feature, incorporating a speaker and LED for locating lost remotes, with a transmitter potentially attached to the TV. The team addressed concerns about radio wave interference by stating that a specific frequency range that does not interfere with other devices will be used. Despite initial reservations, the extra budget was allocated to these features.\n",
    "Professor B's thoughts on noise and speech processing encompass several key areas. Regarding noise's impact on speech frequencies, there's a recognition that even seemingly small differences in MFCCs, particularly in noisy conditions, can hurt recognition accuracy. The discussion of adding white noise highlights a surprising smoothing effect, potentially due to whitening the silence portions of speech, thus making the noise more consistent between training and testing.\n\nProfessor B views smoothing as a way to combat the effects of noise, but also suggests that different smoothing techniques may be more effective in different parts of the signal. FIR filters are mentioned, however, the group is using IIR filters to help reduce latency. Professor B recognizes that FIR filters do not have linear phase. \n\nIn dealing with additive noise, Professor B emphasizes the importance of understanding error types (insertions, deletions) and how different noise compensation methods affect performance in various conditions (noisy vs. quiet). Thresholding, such as adding noise below a certain energy level, is explored as a noise compensation technique. Overall, the professor advocates for careful analysis of errors and a nuanced approach to noise reduction that considers the specific characteristics of the noise and speech signal.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's functions, focusing on user needs and technical capabilities. The remote's primary function is to send commands to the television, including basic actions like power, channel, and volume control. \n\nThe team considered the user experience, aiming for a balance between simplicity and functionality. The marketing expert presented research indicating that users often find current remotes overly complex, using only a fraction of the available buttons. A key consideration was the inclusion of a \"find my remote\" feature, potentially using a beeping sound triggered by a button on the TV.\n\nThe discussion explored innovative input methods, such as a joystick or iPod-like touch wheel, to control channels and volume. The team also addressed the possibility of voice recognition, but it was deemed potentially impractical due to cost and user experience concerns. Ultimately, the group aimed to create a user-friendly and visually appealing remote control that simplifies the television viewing experience.\n",
    "The team proposed a remote control design featuring an ergonomic shape, lightweight plastic construction, and customizable rubbery covers. It includes a power key, volume scroll, channel buttons, and an infrared section. The design aims for simplicity and ease of use, appealing to various age groups with voice control.\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing agreed on the appearance design presentation, with Marketing confirming the prototype aligned with previous discussions.\n\nThe Industrial Designer suggested an alternative sales channel using the internet for promotion and ordering, allowing for greater customization options. Marketing agreed and acknowledged the potential for increased sales through this approach.\n\nMarketing expressed satisfaction with the product's design, finding it well within the discussed ideas. They emphasized the importance of meeting consumer and management criteria. Both teams agreed that the design effectively balanced innovation and practicality within the budget constraints.\n",
    "Grad G, also known as Robert, had opinions on several topics. Regarding capturing the subject intention, Grad G suggested a method involving Bayesian networks and ontologies to fill in CPTs. The professor found this idea related to PRMs (Probabilistic Relational Models) and thought it a good idea to put in Grad G's thesis proposal. \n\nOn MSG, there is no explicit mention of Grad G's opinion.\n\nRegarding pronouncing zero, there is no explicit mention of Grad G's opinion.\n\nRegarding hiring Fey, Grad G had no explicit opinion. The professor was in favor of hiring Fey to rewrite the German concept syntax-to-prosody rules.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer, Sebastian, expressed several thoughts regarding the remote control's design and technology. He initially focused on technical feasibility and interoperability, suggesting the remote should control multiple devices and communicate effectively.\n\nRegarding appearance, Sebastian suggested exploring various materials for the remote's exterior to achieve a reliable and appealing look. He highlighted the importance of the remote's feel when held. He was open to ideas like a size-changing, inflatable remote and considered making it waterproof. He also wanted it to give some sort of oral cue when it understood the message.\n\nConcerning technology, Sebastian was interested in speech recognition, suggesting that a user training process could reduce costs. He also considered wireless charging and solar power. He emphasized the need for the remote to be easily locatable, potentially through a sound emitted upon a voice command. He also seemed interested in radium chips for glow-in-the-dark features.\n\nWhile not directly addressing Bluetooth, he acknowledged its prevalence and potential use. Overall, Sebastian aimed for a blend of innovative technology and practical design within the project's financial constraints.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several key issues.\n\n**Priority of Inspections:** Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders' agreement on the priority of inspections cannot be determined from the provided meeting transcript.\n\n**Reopening of the House of Commons and Diplomatic Relations:** The discussion on reopening the House of Commons centered on the opposition's call for Parliament to resume its full powers, emphasizing the need for debate, questioning, and holding the government accountable. Concerns were raised about the government's transparency and oversight in spending billions of dollars. The government defended its approach by highlighting the hybrid format allowing remote participation and the scrutiny provided by the finance committee.\n\n**Allocation of Funds and Addressing Systematic Racism:** The discussions on allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism involved acknowledging the existence of anti-black racism, systemic discrimination, and unconscious bias in Canada. Justin Trudeau elaborated that the governmental fund has taken concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and injustice across the country. He highlighted investments in mental health services for those who experienced racism and intergenerational trauma, as well as the creation of the anti-racism secretariat. He expressed his thoughts on the revolution in national institutions by stating that they are a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour.\n",
    "The group discussed the technical and functional designs of the remote control, emphasizing user-friendliness and simplicity. The functional design should allow users to easily control their televisions, including basic functions like power, channel, volume, and mute. The technical design considerations included interoperability with various devices, potentially using both infrared and Bluetooth.\n\nA prototype presentation revealed user dissatisfaction with current remotes, favoring simpler designs. The detailed design should incorporate larger, easily identifiable buttons, possibly with a glow-in-the-dark feature. The group also explored the possibility of a homing device, voice recognition, and a limited number of buttons. Specific designing requirements included incorporating the company color and logo, and simplifying the remote by removing less frequently used buttons. The group considered a menu button to access less common functions like audio and screen settings.\n",
    "The team's discussion and evaluation of the project's process, work division, and production plan revealed several key points. Initially, there was a lack of clarity regarding the project's goal, with team members having different understandings of the product being developed (remote control vs. monitor). The marketing team lacked a concrete project plan at the outset, promising one by the next meeting.\n\nThe team evaluated a prototype remote control design, assessing its features, cost, and market viability. They aimed for a fancy, technologically innovative, easy-to-use, fashionable, and robust product. The evaluation involved rating the design against these criteria, leading to adjustments like removing the LCD panel to reduce costs.\n\nTeam members expressed concerns about the project's creative constraints, structured tasks, and limited communication outside of formal meetings. They felt the environment was more about reporting progress than fostering collaborative brainstorming. The tools provided were deemed fancy but not conducive to teamwork, as tasks were divided and worked on in isolation. There was a suggestion to prototype earlier in the process and to have a more flexible, collaborative environment. The use of Play-Doh was found to be surprisingly helpful for conceptualization.",
    "The group discussed future directions for data collection, including using CrossPads, capturing digital pictures of the table and boards, and asking participants to share something interesting they learned. PhD D explained the multilingual model and how it handles multi-channel input, noting IBM will process the data. PhD C and the professor debated the challenges of generating queries and how summaries could help. They considered word frequency counts and pilot experiments. They discussed the value of capturing summaries and multiple perspectives. Releasing meeting data was discussed, with concerns about privacy and anonymization. The group weighed the benefits of making the data useful for discourse analysis against the need to protect participant confidentiality, considering options like bleeping out names or having multiple versions of the release. Ultimately, they decided to delay the anonymization discussion.\n",
    "Ms. Jenny Kwan's statement about the gap between program development and its implementation refers to the complexities and challenges in ensuring that early childhood education and care programs, once designed and developed, are effectively put into practice and reach the families and children they are intended to serve. The Deputy Minister Julie Morgan AM, acknowledged the need to simplify the system, which has grown from various routes and is currently very complex. The pathfinder projects in eight local authorities are looking at ways of joining up the whole system, working with local authorities and health boards to simplify things. The evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. The evaluation for year 2, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. It is from the next one, however, that more information is expected.\n",
    "The Project Manager (PM) did not explicitly share their views on the last meeting review and market research. However, they appeared to value the process, as they asked the Marketing Expert to submit the evaluation criteria and ensured it was included in the minutes. The PM also encouraged consensus-based ratings during the review.\n\nThe PM seemed to be concerned about cost and practicality, as evidenced by their focus on the Excel sheet and price listings, and their questions about the feasibility of certain design choices (e.g., rubber buttons, LCD panel). They also appeared receptive to feedback and willing to make compromises to stay within budget, such as removing the LCD screen.\n\nThe group had a different opinion than the PM in that they were more focused on design and functionality, while the PM was more focused on cost.\n\nThe group explored the idea of using a panther as a drawing but ultimately did not use it. The marketing expert stated they wanted to be a panther as a child, while the industrial designer thought it would be difficult to draw.\n",
    "The team had varying opinions on the remote control features. The Marketing Expert's research indicated that younger users were enthusiastic about an LCD screen and voice recognition. However, older users were less interested. The Industrial Designer was concerned about the feasibility and cost of incorporating these features, especially voice recognition. The User Interface Designer focused on the technical functions, suggesting simpler buttons and a rolling button for easier navigation. \n\nThe Project Manager suggested a joystick and LCD for additional functionality, drawing inspiration from mobile phones. The team also considered the ergonomics of the remote, aiming for a design that could be comfortably used with one hand. The team also considered the possibility of a 'find me' function, incorporating a speaker and/or LED. The team also discussed having a minimalist approach, with a few key buttons and navigation around a menu for most things.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, the Canadian tourism industry faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a steep decline in tourist arrivals, particularly from Asia, and the cancellation of cruises in Atlantic Canada, resulting in substantial financial losses for local communities. Many tourism-dependent small businesses struggled to meet the eligibility criteria for federal aid programs, such as the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA), due to the requirement of demonstrating a 70% revenue drop, which was difficult for seasonal businesses that had not yet launched operations.\n\nThe government implemented measures to mitigate the impact, including allocating $70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada, with a focus on supporting destination marketing organizations to promote local tourism. They also extended the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) programs to assist tourism businesses in covering fixed costs and retaining employees. The government also deferred GST/HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months.\n",
    "The team discussed the design, energy source, components, functional design, and prototype of a new remote control across multiple meetings.\n\n**Design:** The remote's design should be original, trendy, and user-friendly, appealing to a wide age range. It should have a modern, eye-catching design, but be simple to use. The number of buttons should be minimized, focusing on essential functions like power, channel, volume, and mute. Larger buttons were favored, and the company color (yellow) should be incorporated. A homing device was suggested.\n\n**Energy Source and Components:** The energy source was batteries, possibly rechargeable. The components include a case, smart chip, resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, resonators, and infrared LED. A rechargeable battery was considered to cut costs.\n\n**Functional Design:** The remote should send messages to the TV, change channels, and turn the TV on/off. Voice recognition was discussed as a potential \"star feature,\" but its cost and reliability were concerns. Subtitles were deemed important due to the expanding foreign film market.\n\n**Prototype:** The industrial designer and user interface designer will collaborate on a prototype using modeling clay.\n",
    "The group decided to use a single piece of software for noise suppression with multiple options. This software, by default, provides a system with a 53.66 score, which is only one percent off the best proposal.\n\nThe paper, submitted to ASRU, deals with reverberation. The technique used works well with pure reverberation. The paper includes that the signal-to-noise ratio was measured at about 9 DB from actual recordings when reverberation was added.\n\nThe paper also included tests from SpeechDat-Car and Aurora. The left edge of the first filter is at 64. Experiments were done using 100 hertz, but it was more or less the same or slightly worse.",
    "The group discussed training and testing the digits corpus, focusing on multilingual aspects and feature extraction. They aimed to create robust features applicable across languages, considering training data and test data dimensions. The current technique involves using HTK and neural networks, with explorations into different feature sets like PLP, MFCCs, and JRASTA. Limitations include the need for manual annotation, computational constraints, and potential mismatches between training and testing conditions, especially regarding noise.\n\nProgress includes re-evaluating recognition results using Thilo's segmenter and exploring recognizer alignments to train speech detectors. Delays were experienced due to issues with data formats, labeling inconsistencies, and computational demands, prompting discussions on resource allocation and efficient use of available machines. The group also addressed the need for consistent naming conventions and file organization to facilitate collaboration and data management.\n",
    "In the meetings, \"triple R\" was favored over \"triple RC\" due to the emphasis on simplicity and fashion in the product's design. The discussion concluded that the target age group should be between fifteen and thirty-five because this demographic is more inclined towards technology and has more disposable income. However, later it was decided that they might not define the target group by age, but by how much money they have to spend. The marketing team decided to target young people because they are more open to new technologies, like voice recognition. The selection of channels focused on essential functions such as power, channel, and volume, aiming for a streamlined remote control with big, user-friendly buttons. The goal was to revolutionize the design, making it attractive and easy to use, rather than just replicating existing models.\n",
    "The group discussed market research, highlighting that users are generally unhappy with current remote controls, finding them too complex with unnecessary buttons. They want something \"snazzy yet simple.\" Key desired features include a large on/off button, easy channel and volume control, and a \"homing device\" to locate the remote when lost. Speech recognition was proposed as a potentially valuable, albeit costly, addition, especially appealing to younger demographics.\n\nDesign opinions leaned towards minimizing buttons and prioritizing frequently used functions. A sleek, simple design was favored over a complex, \"engineering-centered\" look. Ergonomics and the \"feel\" of the remote were also considered important. The discussion also touched on the possibility of a charging base for the remote, similar to a portable phone. There was no consensus on whether remote interaction needed revolutionizing, but the group seemed to agree on a universal remote that can control multiple devices.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM discussed several key points regarding the new curriculum and related educational aspects.\n\n**Quality Assurance:** Kirsty Williams AM mentioned the involvement of \"quality improvement practitioners\" (QI practitioners) who would participate in workshops to provide feedback on the curriculum with the curriculum and assessment group.\n\n**High-Risk Category:** Bethan Owen's comment on the high-risk category for secondary schools was addressed by Kirsty Williams AM, who acknowledged the need for a multi-agency approach involving the school, local authority, regional consortia, Estyn, and the Welsh Government to support improvement.\n\n**Five Principles:** Kirsty Williams AM focused on four enabling purposes of the curriculum: strong leadership, excellent pedagogy, appropriate assessment, and student well-being.\n\n**New Examinations and School Qualifications:** Kirsty Williams AM agreed that Qualifications Wales must define qualifications, not the other way around.\n\n**Response to Doubts:** Kirsty Williams AM responded to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions by emphasizing their commitment to co-construction with practitioners and experts. She mentioned steps taken to address concerns about certainty and having a national approach, including changing the approach to legislation.\n",
    "The team had mixed feelings about the production process. A major dislike was the budget constraints, which forced them to remove desired features like the LCD panel and explore cheaper material options, such as plastic over rubber. They were also not fans of the amount of PowerPoint used in the project.\n\nOn the other hand, they appreciated the room for creativity, especially in the prototype-making stage with Play-Doh. The team found the Play-Doh helpful for conceptualizing and engaging multiple senses. They also generally agreed that the team worked well together, but noted the process could have been more collaborative if they were allowed to communicate outside of the meetings.\n",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments focuses on its application within the SmartKom system and its potential as a filter. It was tested using past and present frames to calculate the mean, and a slight drop in performance was observed compared to using a centered window. The length of time used to calculate the mean during training was also discussed. The researchers also considered mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA and looked at mean cepstral subtraction as a filter. It was noted that if the system computed means over two, four, and six seconds, it would essentially get a ramp-up of a filter. It was also suggested to do a first pass without mean subtraction or with a short time one and then a longer time version to distinguish between top N possible utterances.",
    "The discussion covered several topics. Regarding mixed signals, there was a focus on unifying noise suppression methods (spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering) into a single software. Postdoc C worked on VAD improvements, testing a combination of MLP-based and energy-based VADs. Preliminary VAD results showed that the current VAD improves over the baseline by fourteen percent, while their current VAD improves by more than twenty percent. Postdoc A's opinion on new headphones was not discussed. Alternative methods to increase space involved the use of barriers or blindfolds during meetings to study the effect of visual cues on overlaps. The deadline mentioned was next week when Hynek returns, to have a firm path for what things will be attacked.\n",
    "Special schools are considered a successful sector by Estyn. Those that struggle tend to be those that deal with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Special schools that are independent tend to focus on children with emotional and behavioral difficulties, so they have a more difficult task to begin with. Estyn visits them annually to make sure they are addressing all recommendations and continue to meet the needs of those pupils. There is a trend where more of those independent schools now have pupils with emotional and behavioral difficulties.\n\nRegarding looked-after children, it was found there was some confusion about where the PDG was, who had the grant, how it was spent, and what the priorities of regional consortia were. Consortia are using the grant, and there is some training being offered to schools around emotional behavior and attachment training. There is some school-to-school work that is now being funded by the grant to share best practice, and there are some individual bursaries to support the work.\n",
    "The prototype of the remote control was introduced by the Project Manager, User Interface Designer, and Industrial Designer with the goal of creating a device that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The Industrial Designer suggested interoperability, so one remote should control multiple devices using different ways of communicating with the equipment. The User Interface Designer suggested that the remote should work on different TVs and devices, making it a universal remote control for customers to buy in stores, not for specific vendors.\n\nThe team discussed whether to include infrared and Bluetooth technology, with the consensus leaning towards including both for cost-effectiveness and broader compatibility. The Industrial Designer brought up technical issues and possibilities, emphasizing the need for the remote to be trendy. The team also touched on the technical functions, such as pressing a button to change the state of the TV, and explored alternative controls like touch screens or a small stick for switching channels. The Industrial Designer also talked about incorporating radio waves to control the TV from anywhere in the house.\n",
    "During the meetings, the Industrial Designer touched on various aspects of the prototype's design, structure, and customer preferences. They emphasized the importance of simple components for robustness over technological innovation. The Industrial Designer suggested combining plastic and rubber for the device's casing. They also pointed out that the design was simple, clean, and plain. The Industrial Designer mentioned that the device should be pretty cheap to develop. They agreed to the single curve design and that the buttons should be made of rubber. Regarding customer preferences, the Industrial Designer noted that the device should be sellable and quirky. They explored alternative delivery and sales channels, suggesting using the internet for promotion and ordering. Lastly, the Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of user testing and synchronizing the device's launch with a special event to maximize its impact.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, here's an overview of the topics you asked about:\n\n**Allocation of $77.5 Million:** A portion of $77.5 million has been allocated through the Emergency Processing Fund. Additionally, AgriRecovery will receive $125 million to support beef and pork producers.\n\n**Solution to Risk Appetite:** The transcripts did not mention any solution to risk appetite.\n\n**Hon. Chrystia Freeland's Perspective on Systemic Racism:** Hon. Chrystia Freeland acknowledges the existence of anti-black racism, unconscious bias, and systemic discrimination in Canada. She emphasizes the importance of addressing these issues and ensuring human rights are protected.\n",
    "The current status of the segmenter is that Thilo's segmenter works amazingly well. Recognition results are being re-evaluated using Thilo's segmenter without cheating on the segmentations. The recognizer alignments are also being used to train up a speech detector so that there won't be so much hand labeling needed to generate training data for the speech detector. The pre-segmentations are extremely helpful to the transcribers. They always appreciate having it available and it is an enormous time saver.",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface (UI) designer and the Industrial Designer disagreed on the price because they had different perspectives on the cost factors. The Industrial Designer believed the product should be cheap to develop, rating it as \"true one,\" while the UI designer suggested a \"two\" due to the need for specialized programming for the menus.\n\nThe UI designer disagreed with the redesign after product evaluation because they were concerned about maintaining the design's integrity and functionality. The UI designer suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because those were the company's colors.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the UI designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance because the marketing team felt that limiting the design to only a few fruit shapes would limit the products appeal to customers.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil, representing ColegauCymru, generally expressed negative opinions about the Welsh bac's effectiveness in preparing learners for employment. \n\nEvans stated that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac's meaning and content, suggesting \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" as a more comprehensible title. Brazil echoed this, noting that employers rarely request the Welsh bac, focusing instead on professional qualifications and skills. He criticized the qualification's bureaucracy and questioned its skill development. Martin concurred, highlighting employers' focus on core qualifications (e.g., engineering certifications) alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills. \n\nOverall, they agreed that employers are largely unfamiliar with and do not necessarily value the Welsh bac as a preparation for employment.\n",
    "The team presented and discussed several ideas and design concepts for the remote control. \n\nChristine, the industrial designer, shared initial ideas, including a remote that turns the TV on and off with the first press, is fashionable and attractive, and resembles an iPod in appeal. She suggested considering different financial models and materials for construction, including the possibility of an unbreakable design. She also proposed features like an inflatable, size-changing remote, waterproof casing, and oral cues to indicate successful command execution.\n\nEd from marketing presented market research indicating a willingness among younger demographics to spend more on trendy remotes with speech recognition. He suggested a simple, one-word speech recognition system for basic commands and a \"find my remote\" feature.\n\nAgnes, the user interface designer, emphasized the need for usability and user acceptance. She suggested minimizing buttons, making frequently used buttons larger and strategically placed, and keeping the design sleek and simple.\n\nThe team discussed various functionalities, including power, volume, menu control, contrast, brightness, audio settings, and input selection. They also considered the materials, colors, and overall design of the remote, aiming for a balance between functionality, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager had several thoughts regarding the remote control project.\n\n**Market Range, Price Issues, and Target Groups:** The Project Manager acknowledged the Marketing team's concerns about international market variations and pricing strategies, understanding that a \u20ac25 price point might appeal differently across regions. They also recognized the need to consider the wealth of the target market when positioning the product. They later shifted the focus to targeting the elderly due to the younger generation's desire for newer tech and the older generations' lack of technological advancements.\n\n**New Features, Feasibility, and Cost Constraints:** The Project Manager was open to innovative features, drawing inspiration from successful technologies like palm pilots to enhance the remote control's functionality. However, they emphasized the importance of staying within the \u20ac12.50 cost constraint, recognizing that high-tech materials could escalate prices. They later decided on a simpler remote control design to help keep costs down.\n\n**Selling Target and Target Market:** The Project Manager stressed the necessity of defining a unique selling point for the remote control and was receptive to ideas like a beeping feature for locating lost remotes. The team was unsure about which age group to target, and it was decided that the User Interface Designer would work on how the remote would work with the user.\n",
    "User Interface (UI) expressed several thoughts about the new remote control project's cost constraints, financial targets, and the replacement of kinetic batteries. UI emphasized simplicity and cost-effectiveness, suggesting a basic plastic design in the company's colors (yellow and black) with a few buttons corresponding to an on-screen display, as opposed to a more expensive LCD screen on the remote itself.\n\nRegarding energy, UI initially favored kinetic energy for its convenience and lighter weight. However, UI acknowledged the importance of cost and further research in the decision-making process. Ultimately, UI and the team went with batteries as their main energy source.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding the direction of future product ideas. Marketing was focused on the \"look and feel\" of the remote, emphasizing innovation in aesthetics rather than functionality. They suggested incorporating trendy themes like fruits and vegetables, vibrant colors, and soft, ergonomic materials. The Industrial Designer, while open to marketing gimmicks, was also concerned with the practical aspects of design and production.\n\nOne specific disagreement was over the use of kinetic energy to power the remote. The Industrial Designer saw it as an interesting marketing gimmick and a way to engage users, while Marketing questioned whether users would want to shake their remote controls. Another point of contention was the decision to make the product upgradable. The Industrial Designer wanted the product to be simple, but upgradability would make the product more complex.",
    "HEFCW's powers of intervention were discussed at length. HEFCW suggested their powers were inflexible and hard to use, even \"threatening,\" making sanctions difficult to use. The Minister disagreed, stating the powers are clear and more than just \"leaning\" on institutions. HEFCW felt it difficult to use their powers for swift interventions, finding them cumbersome, and often taking informal measures due to the small size of the sector.\n\nLooking ahead, the Minister wants to ensure sufficiently flexible regulatory powers for the commission, including advice, guidance, and enhanced monitoring. HEFCW and universities felt the dial only had three steps, going from a \"meeting without coffee\" to institutions going bankrupt, with not enough in between. The Minister wants a graduated escalation of powers.\n\nHEFCW tries to use informal measures due to the small sector, but this may be less likely with the larger tertiary sector. HEFCW's comments came from a time before a loan-based system, where conditions could be attached to grant allocations. The Hazelkorn review focused on outcome agreements and tracking. A balance must be struck between institutional autonomy and the power to intervene. The University of Wales felt HEFCW could issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters, but the Minister doesn't expect this.",
    "The marketing strategy involves creating a remote control with a fancy look and feel, that is technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find, and robust. The group aims to achieve a selling price of twenty-five Euros per remote control, which they believe will generate a profit of fifty million Euros.\n\nTo achieve this, the team plans to design a banana-shaped remote control with a yellow case and a rubber material around it to make it feel spongy. They believe this design will be fashionable and easy to find. The rubber material will also make it robust. The team will evaluate the prototype based on user requirements and market trends. The team believes that the cost is below their threshold, so they can sell it at twenty-five Euros and make a profit.\n",
    "During the pandemic, the Welsh Government took measures to support free-school-meal children. Schools were repurposed to provide safe places for children of front-line workers, and plans were developed to provide emergency free school meals. While the initial response was an emergency one, the goal was to create a seamless system where provision would continue regardless of formal holiday periods.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the need to address digital disadvantage to ensure all children have equal access to learning. The Welsh Government emphasized its commitment to continuity of funding for childcare settings, including Cylch Meithrin, to ensure their survival and ability to provide essential services after the crisis. The potential use of the emergency bill was discussed, including the possibility of directing resources to schools for food provision.\n",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad to potentially improve ergonomics and allow for easier viewing of the screen due to the angle it would create. The ergonomic design of the remote control was also driven by the marketing team's observation that many existing remotes cause Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).\n\nThe agreement on \"easy to use\", \"fashion\", \"easy to find\", and \"robust\" features was based on market research indicating that users are dissatisfied with current remotes, want something simple and visually appealing, and often lose their remotes. The \"easy to use\" aspect was emphasized due to a significant percentage of users finding it time-consuming to learn new remotes. The \"easy to find\" feature was included to address the common problem of lost remotes.\n\nUser Interface did not evaluate the fashion style of the remote control, but the marketing team noted that users would be willing to pay more for a good-looking remote control.\n"
