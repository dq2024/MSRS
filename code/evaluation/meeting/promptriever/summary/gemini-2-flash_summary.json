    "The group needed changes in the data collection process to get information helpful for user-interface design, particularly for querying. They considered using CrossPads for note-taking, but the handwriting recognition quality was a concern. Digital pictures of the table and boards were suggested to provide context for the meetings.\n\nProfessor D expressed that they need more meetings with variety. Postdoc E was concerned about native English speakers and suggested advertising to linguistics graduate students to ensure proficiency. Grad B suggested that the advertisement simply state that the meeting should be held in English. Professor D agreed that if they aimed for groups of graduate students and professors from Berkeley, the English would likely be sufficient.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in relation to the remote control designs. They considered user requirements, market trends, and the importance of factors like look and feel, innovation, and ease of use.\n\nRegarding the user budget, the project manager emphasized the importance of staying within the \u20ac12.50 budget. There was discussion about whether to improve the basic, low-cost design or remove features from the more advanced design to meet the budget. The group ultimately decided to remove the LCD screen and speech recognition from the more advanced remote to meet the budget. They acknowledged the importance of the look and feel to appeal to the target demographic of 20-40 year olds. They decided to include interchangeable covers to keep the product fashionable.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions about the uncertainty of the Canadian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's actions.\n\nCathy McLeod questioned the government's decisions regarding PPE donations to China and the sale of seniors' homes, expressing concern about the availability of supplies for Canadians.\n\nMona Fortier addressed concerns about businesses falling through the cracks in the support programs and emphasized the government's commitment to listening and providing assistance.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie raised the issue of companies using tax havens and the government's response, questioning whether the government would seize the opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal.\n",
    "The industrial manager, Kate, initially considered the cat as a source of inspiration. She liked cats because they're independent, know what they want, and get it. However, when the team was asked to draw their favorite animal and discuss its characteristics, Kate drew a horse. She admired horses because they are pretty, fit well in their environment, run nicely, feel sturdy, and are nice to the touch. She liked the way they felt under her hand.\n",
    "The team discussed the transcriber interface and alternative transcription tools, focusing on improving efficiency and accuracy.\n\nOne suggestion was to use type token frequency listings to identify inconsistencies and misspellings in the transcripts. They also talked about how to handle acronyms, numbers, and colloquial spoken forms in a consistent manner, with the goal of creating a clean and channelized dataset. Spot checks were being conducted to ensure consistency between transcribers.\n\nThe team also explored integrating the THISL IR tool with the Transcriber interface for information retrieval and playback of audio segments. They considered the pros and cons of different user interface options, including Tcl-TK-based GUI and Windows-based interfaces. There was also discussion of using CrossPads for note-taking and time synchronization, but the idea was met with concerns about infrastructure and usability.\n",
    "The presentations covered various aspects of designing a new remote control. The industrial designer focused on the device's internal components, including the power source, infrared signal for communication with the TV, and the potential for smaller batteries to reduce the remote's size. They also emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness and differentiation from competitors, suggesting features like an \"anti-losing-down-the-side-of-the-sofa\" mechanism.\n\nThe user interface designer aimed to simplify TV interaction by creating a user-friendly remote with essential functions on top and more complex features accessible via a flip-top design. They suggested added features like a shockproof body and a design appealing to a wide audience.\n\nThe marketing presentation highlighted market research findings indicating that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls and are willing to spend more for a fancier design. Key frustrations included remotes getting lost and being too difficult to learn, with a preference for user-friendliness over complex button layouts. Younger users desired features like an LCD screen and speech recognition. The team also discussed potential design variations for different markets and age groups, and the possibility of incorporating the company logo into the remote's design.\n",
    "The discussion about early implementer areas focused on note-taking methods, the potential use of CrossPads, and the creation of summaries.\n\nThe group discussed the possibility of using note-taking things to create summaries. The downside was that the quality of handwriting recognition was quite poor. They talked about frequent things people want to do and coming up with some code for them to keep it simple. They discussed the need to broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just internal ones.\n\nThe group also considered the idea of using CrossPads to ask people to write down and mark things that come up during meetings. One idea was to delegate someone to be a note-taker at most meetings and use those notes.\n\nThere was a discussion about how to generate queries and the challenge of motivating people to participate in generating queries after the meeting. They talked about recording summaries instead of writing them and the idea of recording multiple people summarizing the meeting. The group discussed the idea of going around the room at the end of the meeting and asking people to mention something interesting that they learned.",
    "The Project Manager had several thoughts on the product's features.\n\n**Speech Recognition:** The Project Manager was initially challenged on the inclusion of speech recognition due to cost constraints, but expressed that it was a personal favorite feature and the main selling point. They also mentioned concerns about the time it would take to develop and integrate.\n\n**Technology:** The Project Manager was open to technological advancements but emphasized the importance of ease of use and staying within budget.\n\n**Voice Recognition:** The Project Manager was in favor of voice recognition but expressed that it needed to leave space money-wise for the voice recognizer.\n\n**Cost Constraints:** The Project Manager consistently emphasized the importance of staying within the budget of twelve fifty Euros per unit. They were open to increasing the cost slightly if it meant adding new technological advancements and a fancy design, but ultimately the cost was a very important factor.\n\n**LCD Incorporation:** The Project Manager was skeptical about including an LCD screen due to concerns about cost and whether it would make the remote too complicated to use. They noted that while LCD screens are trendy, they might not be necessary for the target audience.\n\n**Button Design:** The Project Manager favored fewer buttons and emphasized the importance of clear and recognizable symbols, especially for an international market. They also liked the idea of raised buttons and a prominent on/off button.\n",
    "The team engaged in discussions regarding recording conventions and the incorporation of video recordings. They explored the idea of using CrossPads for note-taking during meetings, but were concerned about handwriting recognition quality. They considered developing a simple coding system for frequent actions to improve CrossPad utility.\n\nThe team also considered the use of digital cameras to capture the meeting environment, including participant positions and whiteboard content. This information would serve as a contextual record for the meeting. While some supported the idea of video recording for potential future research, others expressed concerns about the effort required for setup, storage, anonymization, and standardization. Concerns about participant willingness to be filmed were also raised. Ultimately, they decided to take a couple of digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting.",
    "The discussion on project finance centered around the target selling price of twenty-five Euros for the remote control, aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. There was a debate on whether this price point was appropriate given the product's features and the willingness of consumers to pay that much for a remote control. The final cost came in at twelve point five, which was right on target.\n\nThe team also used the whiteboard to brainstorm and illustrate ideas. One member drew a spider to demonstrate whiteboard functionality. Another member drew an elephant and talked about the differences between Indian and African elephants. The team also used the whiteboard to gauge their response to whether the product met all of the criteria set out to solve from the point of view of the consumer and management.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer focused on the practical aspects of the remote control's design, such as its ergonomics, ease of use, and how it would stand.

They also carefully evaluated the design against the project's criteria, such as originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the proposed design met the initial requirements. The cost was within budget, and the evaluation, based on user requirements and market trends, was positive. They noted the design's innovative and different appearance, suggesting it could be marketed as a fashion accessory. The Project Manager felt the team had successfully balanced technological innovation with cost constraints and creativity.\n",
    "The team initially decided on a gunmetal gray plastic base for the remote. The industrial designer suggested a single curvature for the bottom part to fit the hand, which was approved.\n\nThe team used a seven-point scale to evaluate the prototype against criteria like ease of use and fashionability. \"Feel good\" was defined as the physical sensation of holding the remote. The team members rated the prototype individually and discussed their reasoning. They considered the prototype's aesthetics, voice recognition capabilities, and technological innovation. The team acknowledged the prototype's limitations but focused on its potential to be trendy and fashionable.\n\nThe team discussed the pros and cons of existing remotes and the need for innovation beyond mere functionality. Some team members expressed concerns about limiting the remote to only TV use. The team explored different battery options, ultimately choosing lithium for its technologically advanced appeal. The industrial designer expressed feeling stifled creatively by being restricted to a T.V. remote.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of a potential environmentally friendly remote control. They considered using a spongy material for the exterior, drawing inspiration from current fashion trends like fruits and vegetables for colors and overall design. Potential materials included plastic, rubber, and even titanium, each with its pros and cons regarding cost, durability, and user experience.\n\nThe inclusion of an LCD screen was debated, with concerns about its impact on the remote's sturdiness and coherence with the overall design concept. The group also discussed the use of a kinetic battery versus standard batteries, considering user habits and cost implications. They also considered voice recognition technology and a questionnaire. They also touched on a two-piece remote. The discussion also covered the chip-on-print.\n",
    "During the meeting, the Project Manager introduced the project's goals: to create a new, original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control. The User Interface designer, Hamed Getabdar, expressed a preference for radio wave remotes over infrared, citing the inconvenience of needing to point the remote directly at the device.\n\nThe team discussed the drawbacks of multi-functional remotes with numerous small buttons, suggesting simpler interfaces. They considered a slider for volume control but raised concerns about accidental volume spikes. There was a discussion of whether the remote should have more technology, such as speech recognition or the ability to sort by contents.\n\nThe team considered the technical challenges of gathering program content data, which led to the technological aspect getting lower grades.\n\nThe possibility of a locator feature was not discussed in the provided transcripts.\n",
    "PhD A raised concerns about variance in the data due to inconsistent microphone usage and placement. They advocated for standardizing microphone types and their positioning to improve data quality for dialogue and prosody research. PhD C reported progress on speech/non-speech detection, working on energy-based channel activity detection to aid transcribers.\n\nThe discussion with Jose (Pepe) focused on his work using energy as an indicator of overlaps. Professor G mentioned that he was told to call Jose, Pepe. However, initial findings suggested normalization was not straightforward. There was discussion of different energy types, normalization windows, and pitch-related features.\n\nRegarding overlaps, the group discussed the need for finer-grained encoding, with Dave Gelbart modifying MultiTrans to allow for precise time marking of overlapping segments. There was also discussion of high-level labeling of overlap types.\n",
    "The discussion on latency in the system centered around the need to reduce it to meet certain performance benchmarks. The system had a total latency of 330 milliseconds, and the goal was to bring it down to 250 milliseconds or less. Some participants at another competition wanted it to be 30 to 40 milliseconds.\n\nProfessor A had an issue with the latency because he felt it was indicative of a lack of communication within the team, leading to inefficiencies in the system's design. The professor believed the fact that the system was adamant about going in with a brain-damaged system indicated that it needed improvement. Additionally, he felt the latency was unnecessary for the application, as the recognition was being done on a remote server, and a quarter of a second was acceptable for processing.\n\nThe discussion also touched upon potential sources of latency, such as FIR filters, downsampling, online normalization, and the neural net and PCA components of the system. Proposed solutions included using recursive filters, improving downsampling techniques, and optimizing the neural net.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the detailed design of the prototype by User Interface included considerations for user-friendliness, the number of buttons, and whether the remote control should be lighted for use in the dark. One feature introduced was the idea of a remote control finder, where a button on the TV would make the remote beep to locate it. Additionally, there was a discussion around making the remote control waterproof, potentially bundling it with plastic protection, and considering the user habit of adding extra plastic for protection. The advantages of these features included increased user convenience, durability, and potential market differentiation.\n",
    "The presentation and discussion focused on a prototype remote control model. The appearance featured a yellow, banana-shaped case made of rubber material to give it a spongy feel.\n\nTwo versions of the prototype were discussed. The first version had a scroll for volume on the left, buttons for channels up and down on the right, and a power key on top. It also had an infrared section. The second version was a flip-open design with a plastic body, a top LCD black and white touchscreen, and standard buttons on the bottom screen. This version also had kinetic batteries and voice recognition.\n\nThe discussion covered the evaluation criteria, including fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, fashion, robustness, and cost. The team also considered the ergonomics and how the remote would be placed down. The conclusion was that the cost was within budget and the evaluation was generally positive, leading to a decision to proceed with the project.\n",
    "The group discussed several design elements for the new universal remote control, always keeping budget constraints and functionality in mind. For the touch screen, the group considered it for the younger generation and the Japanese market. Ergonomics also came into play as the group discussed repetitive strain injuries. For the flip screens, the group thought that frequently used functions would be on top, and complex functions would be in the middle part of the flip-top, so a wide range of audiences can access the remote. Regarding battery issues, triple A batteries were initially considered, but the industrial designer raised concerns about the bulkiness. The group also explored circular batteries and rechargeable options with a charging base, similar to mobile phones. Finally, the flip-top design was selected to reduce the control size and provide an electronic panel for further features.",
    "The Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru.\n\nEstyn has noted that the track record of standards and provision has not slipped during the period of change. The commitment and engagement of teachers and leaders with curriculum reform and wider education reform are to be congratulated. Going forward, the process of co-construction \u2013 engaging with the profession and ensuring they are behind all changes \u2013 must continue.\n\nThe new curriculum re-professionalizes the profession and the new curriculum is an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how schools teach and learn. It is up to each school to decide what they are going to teach and what they are teaching in order to prepare their young people for the new world.\n\nThe greatest problem is ensuring that schools receive support and that the support is multi-agency support, where all the agencies that support these schools are working together. It is the responsibility of everyone involved \u2013 Estyn, the regions, local authorities, the schools themselves, and their governing bodies \u2013 to look at how they can best support the school to bring about improvement.\n",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes that Brexit has had a significant impact on Wales' higher education system. He acknowledges a decrease in applications from EU students, with an 8% drop contrasting with a 2% increase in England.\n\nHe attributes this decline to two main factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to find the full fee, and the Anglocentric nature of the media. He suggests that the change in student support arrangements had a perturbing effect.\n\nDr. Blaney also highlights that the relative levels of investment in facilities, particularly buildings and equipment, between Wales and England impact students' choices, as the state of campuses and resources influence their perception of quality and student experience.\n\nHe notes that the 'Study in Wales' program is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study and increase Wales' presence in the international market. The messages that prospective students should study in Wales include relative safety and the UK-quality system.\n",
    "Based on the transcripts, the mental spaces involved in this project seem to encompass several domains. These include:\n\n1.  **Acoustics and Signal Processing:** This domain involves analyzing speech signals, detecting overlaps, handling noise, and exploring techniques like echo cancellation.\n\n2.  **Transcription and Annotation:** This covers transcribing meetings, marking events (speech, non-speech, overlaps, breaths), and dealing with issues like speaker identification and anonymization.\n\n3.  **Speech Recognition:** This area focuses on improving speech recognition systems, feature extraction, and adaptation techniques.\n\n4.  **Data Collection and Management:** This domain includes recording meetings, managing disk space, and ensuring participant consent.\n\n5.  **Discourse Analysis:** This involves understanding the structure of conversations and applying tools to assist in the analysis.\n\nThe middle layer would function as a bridge between lower-level acoustic features and higher-level discourse or semantic analysis. For example, it could use acoustic features to detect overlaps or speaker turns, which could then be used to inform a discourse model. The middle layer could also handle issues like noise reduction or speaker diarization, making the data more suitable for both acoustic and discourse analysis.\n",
    "The professor is interested in storing data but also has some concerns. He believes that with enough data, inference structures would be useful. He also suggests that the group should project into the future when they have a lot of data and such things might be useful. The professor also notes that it is important to consider Human Subject concerns when storing data, especially regarding names and slander. He also states that it is important to have a good system for getting the data and that the group needs to do a bunch of recordings and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions, even if they're slightly flawed.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several critical issues.\n\nFirst, the seniors care crisis was discussed with a focus on reports from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing appalling conditions in long-term care homes, including neglect, abuse, and high death tolls. There was a call for national standards to govern long-term care, similar to the Canada Health Act, and concerns were raised about prioritizing profit over care.\n\nSecond, the relationship between racism and long-term care in government policy, the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racialized and marginalized communities was acknowledged. Discussions included systemic racism within law enforcement, particularly the RCMP, with calls for reviews of the use of force and prohibitions on racial profiling.\n\nThird, amendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were mentioned with concerns about workers and businesses falling through the cracks of existing programs. There was a call for more flexibility in eligibility criteria and support for sole proprietors.\n\nFourth, Hon. Lawrence MacAulay's perspective on the public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families was brought up. He assured that anyone is welcome to enter any discussion on compensation of veterans and that they are always open to what they can do in order to make sure that they provide appropriate compensation.\n\nFinally, pandemic assistance for seniors was discussed with the Minister of Seniors statement on pandemic assistance for seniors. A temporary increase to the old age security was proposed as well as GST credit supplements.",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer had disagreements due to their differing perspectives and priorities regarding the remote control's design. The Industrial Designer focused on technical aspects, components, and functionality, such as power sources and transmission technologies. Marketing was concerned with market trends, customer preferences (e.g., appearance, ease of use), and aligning the design with the company's image (\"fashion in electronics\"). The Project Manager was focused on project constraints such as budget, time to market, and the company's specific requirements (e.g., corporate color/slogan, limited functionality to only TV control).\n\nThese differing viewpoints led to disagreements regarding specific features like speech recognition (its cost, effectiveness, and target audience), the inclusion of advanced functions (whether to eliminate them or hide them), and design choices (e.g., button size, shape, and layout). The need to balance innovation, usability, market appeal, and project limitations created friction as each team member advocated for their area of expertise.\n",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation based on user requirements and market trends discussed in previous meetings. The evaluation criteria included whether the product had a fancy look and feel, was technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find in a room, and robust.\n\nTo gauge the team's response, Marketing used a scoring system where team members would assign points (1, 2, or 7) based on how well the product met each criterion. They also considered the product's conformity to current fashion trends, company strategy, and environmental safety. The team's feedback was then averaged to determine the overall evaluation of the product.\n",
    "The transcription status shows that roughly 35 hours of meeting recordings have been collected, including digit recordings. As of a week and a half prior to the meeting, 32 hours had been collected. Approximately 11 hours of recordings have been fully transcribed. The priority is to ensure the data is clean, channelized, and meets established conventions for numbers and acronyms. Postdoc F. is also working on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins.\n\nRegarding recordings, the group seems to have a reliable way of getting the data in through the Sony radio mikes, as long as they're conscious about the batteries.\n\nRegarding intermediate categories, the use of vocalized/non-vocalized/gloss tags is being implemented. Additionally, Dr. Thilo had a breakthrough in speech-non-speech segmentation.",
    "In the meetings, the Deputy Minister, Julie Morgan AM, addressed her amendments concerning the duty to promote public awareness by stating her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law. She resisted amendments that highlighted specific groups, set out specific topics, or required information about raising concerns. She emphasized a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over six years, guided by an expert stakeholder group.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, she highlighted that the amendments were influenced by a committee recommendation for a post-implementation review. She explained that the review would be a continuous program, including attitudinal surveys and data collection. She opposed amendments requiring a report on awareness-raising before the law commenced.\n\nOn regulation-making powers, she brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill. While she did not think it necessary to have wider powers, she was happy to discuss this before Stage 3.\n",
    "The discussion on long-term trends emphasized the importance of ongoing engagement with the teaching profession in curriculum reform. There's a need to ensure standards don't slip during periods of change. There was also a desire to re-professionalize the teaching profession.\n\nPhilip Blaker, representing Qualifications Wales, focused on maintaining standards and ensuring fair awarding of qualifications. He mentioned comparable outcomes as a primary approach during specification changes. He also noted the need to review timelines for future reforms to allow for greater system readiness.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of exams, the timeline for the new curriculum is such that young people will be assessed for the first time in the summer of 2027. Qualifications Wales will make a go/no-go decision in 2023 on whether the conditions are right for safe implementation, with the possibility of delaying qualification reforms by a year if necessary.\n",
    "The witnesses generally support the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. They think the current law is ineffective and unclear. Alastair Birch, representing ADEW, stated the rights of the child should be achieved under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Sally Jenkins, representing ADSS, welcomed the proposed change for the clarity it would bring for children, parents, and professionals.\n\nThe committee emphasized the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasted with what they had been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasized the importance of simplicity in the Bill. The Welsh Government gave a commitment to full involvement in the implementation of the bill, and there is a commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, because they need to take families, carers, and parents with them on this. There also needs to be support available to parents and carers that do sometimes struggle with parenting, and that needs to be a universal offer across Wales.",
    "The group discussed different components for the remote control, focusing on the case material, energy source, and interface. \n\nFor the case, initial ideas included a yellow banana shape with a spongy rubber material. Concerns arose about the shape's appeal to male users, leading to the idea of removable covers. Other materials considered were plastic, titanium and wood. Plastic was initially considered for its versatility, but eliminated because of brittleness. Titanium was eliminated due to manufacturing challenges with curved cases. Wood was selected as an environmentally friendly material, allowing for custom designs.\n\nRegarding the interface design, the discussion revolved around simplicity, a limited number of buttons, and the potential for speech recognition. A two-part design was suggested, with a simple handheld remote and a separate control unit for advanced features. A scroll wheel interface, similar to an iPod, was considered, but concerns were raised about the cost and integration with a \"squishy\" case. A flip screen, like on flip phones, was proposed to prevent accidental button presses, but the added weight was a concern.\n",
    "The professor does not give specific thoughts on the final model. However, the professor does have thoughts on the digits for the model. The professor thinks that if they start talking about trying to get at natural groupings, there is nothing natural about reading numbers this way. The professor also stated that if there is a misread of the digits, to take the easy way out.\n\nPhD C is working on harmonicity detection to improve the model but is having issues with too many harmonics. They also discussed instantaneous frequency.\n\nThe group also discussed the handling of breaths. They talked about if speech recognition wants to know where the breaths are. The consensus was that they don't want to remove breaths from the corpus, because it is real data.\n",
    "The group discussed the introduction of a new remote control project, focusing on key concepts and features.\n\n**Concept Decisions:**\nThe group decided to aim for a sleek and simple design, moving away from traditional remote appearances. The design will be voice-activated, with a simple button layout and a focus on primary functions like on/off, channel, and volume. The team decided to incorporate a drop-down or side menu for secondary functions.\n\n**Universal Remote:**\nThe remote will be television-only and will not have DVD or other device functionality.\n\n**Parental Control:**\nThe user interface designer suggested the ability to block channels, but it was not a main focus.\n\n**Games:**\nGames were not discussed.\n\n**Voice Recognition:**\nVoice recognition was a key selling point, enabling users to control basic functions like power, channel, and volume. The remote would potentially have additional features like jokes when the device is ready. The group also decided on multiple case colors, drawing inspiration from Apple's iMac/iPod color schemes.\n",
    "During the meetings, the group discussed the evaluations of increasing suicide crimes and the long-term special care for pregnant women during COVID-19. Vaughan Gething elaborated that the government is commissioning a review to understand the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not.\n\nGething also discussed perinatal mental health, noting that the government is looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that they've made. Part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that he's previously committed to. He is concerned about the time frame. He is impressed by the continuing commitment of the staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time.\n",
    "The work of Professor Dylan Jones' strategic delivery group is scheduled to be completed to coincide with the successful implementation of the curriculum. This group is tasked with establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other. The group has been working for about 18 months and is designed to build collective efficacy. It is not controlled by Government, it is arm's length from Government. Sian Gwenllian raised a concern that it may lose focus, but the Minister assured that it will not.\n\nThe Minister believes it is inevitable that whatever measures are put in place, people will look to maximize their success in those measures. The Minister aims to challenge schools to look at the performance of all of their children. Lastly, the Minister would like the permanent set of performance measures to look at a wider set of behaviours within a school, and the way in which those schools achieve those results are also important.\n\nNetworking within the PRU and transition arrangements were not discussed in the meeting.",
    "The industrial designer mentioned that current remote controls are all infra-red. If the group wanted to build a remote control with Bluetooth, for instance, then the television would need to have Bluetooth as well to communicate. That would mean extra cost for the user and would not be a cheap remote control.\n\nIn terms of disposable income, the marketing expert noted that 80% of users would spend more money if a remote control looked fancy. The group also discussed the selling price of the remote control, which was targeted at twenty-five euros. The production cost could be maximal twelve and a half Euros.\n",
    "The group believes that eligibility for free school meals (EFSM) is a good measure for identifying disadvantaged children, as there is a strong correlation between EFSM and underachievement. However, the group also notes that this may not be the best way.\n\nThe group acknowledges that the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) has led to improvements in attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals. They cite examples of schools using PDG funding to improve attendance by implementing community-focused initiatives and working with families. Despite these improvements, attendance remains a major problem, and further attention is needed to address the social issues impacting attendance. The group mentions that while there have been small improvements in closing the attainment gap between students on and not on free school meals, there has not been a major step change.",
    "The professor is not a fan of support vector machines for speech recognition. He believes that the tandem system's pre-final nonlinearity outputs transform the information to be more discriminative. He also thinks the real power of the system is its transformational capability, taking all sorts of different wild things that we do, not just the standard front-end, but other things, like multiple streams. He believes a properly trained Gaussian system trained directly on the features with the right choice of parameters might be better than a tandem system.\nThe professor thinks speaking rate algorithms are useful for speech recognition. He suggests using time position normalized by speaker to account for speaking rate. He also mentions that pitch features are better than in Switchboard because of the close-talking microphones.",
    "The professor believes the sounds of echoes, reverberation, and acoustic events are important to study. He would like to find parameters to detect overlapping zones, and test these parameters with other acoustic events. This is to find the false hypothesis produced when using the different features. The professor also knows that he needs to label the different acoustic events that are not speech, like silence, to detect the changes in speech. He believes that the mixed signal from the headphones will sound different than the signal collected by the microphone. He also believes that the mixed signal may have more acoustic events that can be identified. He is going to try to get a good handle on what kind of questions people want to ask, more than anything they do before that.",
    "The team discussed the user interface design of a new television remote control, focusing on making it more user-friendly and trendier than previous models. Key points included addressing the common confusion caused by too many small buttons, exploring the possibility of a multi-functional remote that controls various devices (TV, DVD, sound system), and ensuring compatibility across different brands.\n\nThe team also considered the design's ergonomics, suggesting a curved shape to fit comfortably in the hand. The discussion touched on practical aspects such as battery type (double or triple A) and the inclusion of a backlight for use in dark rooms, potentially with light-dependent activation to conserve battery life. One participant suggested a slider for volume control, while another cautioned against the potential for accidental volume spikes. The team agreed on the importance of a well-written instruction booklet and the need for the remote to be simple enough for anyone to use. The team decided that the User Interface Designer will work on the design of the remote control.\n",
    "The project manager had several thoughts regarding the plastic material, changeable cover, color, and shape of the model.\n\nRegarding the plastic material, the project manager stated that it was \"simply made of plastic so that's no problem.\" For the changeable covers, the project manager seemed receptive to the idea, especially regarding the concept of it being a fashion accessory.\n\nAs for the color, the project manager noted the cost associated with the color of the whole thing and stated that if the colors were corporate colors, it would not be a special color.\n\nIn terms of the shape, the project manager initially questioned how people would put the remote down, suggesting it might need a broader base to stand vertically, especially if it was marketed as a fashion item. However, the project manager later stated that the basic concept of the shape was \"absolutely bang on\" and met the criteria of \"looking different.\"\n",
    "The discussion focused on improving the baseline system and addressing issues related to data processing and transcription. There was talk of using Thilo's segmenter to improve recognition, and retraining or adapting models for background noise. The conversation included potentially hiring another transcriber, and Jane is working on cleaning and channelizing the data, as well as tightening time bin boundaries. \n\nThe group also explored different front-ends and vocal tract length normalization to improve the PLP features. There were discussions on tuning the size of the Gaussian system. It was also mentioned that experiments using vocal tract normalization only in the test data improved the system's performance. The group also talked about different combinations of neural net outputs and regular features.",
    "The meeting transcripts discussed several key areas. Legislation included proposed bills on euthanasia safeguards and organ harvesting. Sports infrastructural construction was mentioned in the context of economic recovery. Government support for energy resources, tourism, green economy, and small businesses was a recurring theme, with members questioning the adequacy and accessibility of existing programs. The impact of COVID-19 on fishing, tourism, oil, and gas was also a significant concern.\n\nSpecific issues raised included the need for financial support for fishers and lobster fisheries affected by market disruptions, the potential collapse of the tourism accommodation sector, and the crisis in the oil and gas sector due to decreased demand and pipeline barriers. The discussion also touched on challenges faced by farmers and meat-packing plants.\n",
    "The team discussed the design and functionality of the remote control. Initially, the team considered various shapes, including flat, single-curved, and double-curved designs. The industrial designer favored a double-curved design for its aesthetic appeal but noted it couldn't be made of titanium. The single-curved design was chosen for feasibility. The team explored personalization, including programmable sound and color options. The user interface designer proposed articulation for left- or right-handed users.\n\nThe team considered a novel shape, drawing inspiration from fruit and vegetables. The marketing representative suggested that a banana shape could be used, and the team considered a monkey sound for the locator feature. Ultimately, the team leaned towards a single-curved design with a dark blue base color, fruit-themed accents in primary colors, and customizable LED lighting. The final decision on the casing shape was a single-curved design, which was a compromise between the different ideas.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed using fruit and vegetable-inspired colors, such as lemon or lime, for the product because market research indicated that younger people preferred these vibrant, \"fruity\" colors. This aligned with the company's goal to incorporate current fashion trends into the remote control's design, specifically catering to the preferences of the younger demographic. The idea was to create a \"fancy\" and visually appealing product that would resonate with this target group.\n",
    "The overall conclusion is positive regarding the new remote control's design and market evaluation. The design meets the criteria of being different and innovative, and the team believes it will appeal to a broad range of age groups due to its simplicity and voice control features, potentially offsetting concerns about older users being less willing to pay extra. The design is considered ergonomically correct, potentially minimizing repetitive strain injury compared to current standards. The project is within budget, and the team is satisfied that the final design meets both consumer and management requirements. The team believes they have allowed themselves as much creativity as the product allows.\n",
    "The committee discussed the potential impact of Brexit on higher and further education. Assessments of the future of institutions included discussions on preparedness for a \"no deal\" scenario, with officials visiting individual institutions to discuss their plans. The HEFCW has also been doing specific work, though the extent of its availability for sharing was not clear.\n\nOn women's issues, the meetings did not focus on specific issues relating to women.\n\nThe committee heard that the FE sector was more anchored within its communities and that the impact of ESF funding on FE was significant. They discussed how the economy and dislocation of companies could impact the number of apprenticeships on offer, with approximately \u00a315 million a year going into the FE sector for apprenticeships.\n\nMembers discussed the student voice, the importance of the Erasmus+ arrangements, and the need for clear messages that Welsh institutions are open for business and welcome EU and international students. They also discussed the potential for a \"no deal\" Brexit and the need for scenario planning, particularly in sectors like farming, health and social care, and manufacturing.\n",
    "The discussion about the meeting recordings focused on the \"digits\" portion of the meetings. The group needs to determine how many more digit forms are available. Some were found to be blank, indicating they hadn't been read. It was also mentioned that the digit collection is done in unison, but the data is not identical, as people sometimes say \"zero\" as \"O.\" The group is also doing a test with the transcriber, Brian, to use a beep and then a digit to indicate breaks in the speaking. Finally, the group is looking into automatic segmentation of the digits so they will not need to do hand-segmentation.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the recommendation for a speech recognition interface stems from several factors. The User Interface designer includes voice recognition as a user interface aspect. The Marketing Expert's market research indicates that users desire technologically innovative and different features, with voice recognition being a key element.\n\nThe benefits as perceived by the team members are:\n\n*   **User Interface Designer:** Speech recognition is part of the user interface and allows for pre-programmed answers.\n*   **Marketing Expert:** Speech recognition aligns with market trends, adding a technologically innovative feature that users are willing to pay more for. It also caters to user convenience.\n*   **Industrial Designer:** Integrating a microphone is feasible.\n*    **All:** Allows for limited vocabulary, such as numbers, volume up, volume down, brightness, and contrast.",
    "Here's a summary of the discussion on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill:\n\n**Political Background and Aim:**\n\n*   The Bill aims to remove the defense of \"reasonable punishment\" in cases of alleged child abuse, aligning Welsh law with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n*   The goal is to provide clarity for children, parents, and professionals and to promote a cultural shift towards positive, non-violent parenting.\n\n**Attitudes and Opinions:**\n\n*   **Support:** The Association of Directors of Social Services, the Association of Directors of Education Wales, and the Welsh Local Government Association generally support the Bill.\n*   They view it as a natural progression in how Wales cares for children and as a means to protect children from harm.\n*   **Clarity vs. Simplicity:** While emphasizing the need for clarity around the definition of corporal punishment, witnesses also recognize the importance of simplicity in the Bill.\n\n**Role of Regional Consortia and Cabinet Secretary:**\n\n*   The discussion doesn't explicitly mention \"regional consortia.\"\n*   The WLGA position is that the state's paramount role is to protect children from harm.\n\n**Statements by Jassa Scott and Comments on the Auditor General:**\n\n*   There are no statements made by Jassa Scott and comments on the Auditor General in the transcript.\n\n**Firearms Seizure Issue and Social Stability:**\n\n*   This topic is not discussed in the meeting transcript.\n\n**Implementation and Resources:**\n\n*   There are concerns about the potential impact on social services, which are already under pressure.\n*   Witnesses stressed the importance of adequate resources and support for families to prevent escalation of harm and neglect.\n*   There is a commitment from the Welsh Government to full involvement in the implementation, and it is hoped that the implementation will be done carefully, with the right resources.",
    "The team discussed several functions for the remote control. The marketing expert brought up the idea of a \"lost-and-found\" function, similar to a mobile phone locator, where the remote would beep when prompted.\n\nDuring project evaluation, improvements were discussed based on user feedback. The team noted that users found current remotes hideous and not very useful, and that younger demographics were interested in voice recognition. This led to the consideration of voice recognition as a key feature.\n\nNew functions brainstormed included voice recognition for basic controls like on/off, channel selection, and volume. The team also discussed the possibility of a touch screen interface with submenus for additional features. The industrial designer suggested the possibility of users being able to input different types of skins for the interface, but the team decided against it.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the group considered dropping the \"special colors\" of the buttons to cut costs. The User Interface designer believed that the special colors contributed to a trendy feel and look, so they wanted to keep them.\n\nHowever, Marketing was dissatisfied with the changes made to the buttons. Marketing believed that the remote was no longer eye-catching, except for the colors, and the design no longer aimed at the young market. They felt the final product lacked the initial appeal and playfulness due to budget constraints.",
    "The key points regarding the Welsh dimension emphasize nurturing Welsh authors and developing resources bilingually from the start to avoid clunky translations. Subsidy will be necessary to produce resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum.\n\nRegarding employers' understanding of the Welsh baccalaureate, it was generally agreed that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac, its value, or its contents. Employers are more focused on professional qualifications and specific skills. The initial vision of the Welsh bac as an overarching qualification to develop employability skills has been lost. Employers should have more input into a review of the qualification to ensure employability and entrepreneurial skills are included.\n\nOn the topic of an independent body for inspecting in Wales, the benefits of having an independent regulator and a single awarding body is that it enables a close working relationship while maintaining regulatory distance, avoiding a \"race to the bottom\" in standards, which can occur with competing exam boards.\n",
    "The group generally agreed on the convenience and ease of use of the presentation materials. The project manager stated that they didn't see how they could've made it any easier. They felt the remote's design, with fewer buttons and voice control, was more ergonomic than current standards. The team agreed that the product would appeal to a wide range of age groups due to its simplicity and ease of use. They believed older users would appreciate the voice control, while younger users would be drawn to its fashionable design. The team felt they had allowed themselves as much creativity as the product allowed and that the team worked well together. Overall, the group was happy that the project met all the criteria and was evaluated positively.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to cost concerns. The advanced chip required to support LCDs was more expensive, and the team was operating on a limited budget. Additionally, some team members felt that an LCD display was unnecessary, as most TVs could display the channel information directly on the screen. This would eliminate the need for the advanced chip and the extra cost of the LCD.\n",
    "**Self-Introduction:**\nThe first meeting transcript lacked direct self-introductions. Instead, the project manager initiated the meeting by outlining the agenda and acknowledged the contributions of colleagues. The second meeting transcript revealed a more explicit attempt to document participant identities, with individuals stating their names and channel numbers for recording purposes.\n\n**Project Introduction:**\nThe project focused on evaluating a prototype, specifically a yellow, banana-shaped remote control made with a spongy rubber material.

The project manager facilitated the meetings, ensuring that all aspects of the project were thoroughly evaluated and that decisions were made based on the team's collective expertise.",
    "The team had differing opinions regarding rechargeable units. The project manager mentioned wanting a recharger. The industrial designer and the user interface designer agreed but didn't want an \"Accu\" (accumulator). The project manager clarified that they would use batteries, which would be cheaper. Later, the project manager suggested putting the bottom of the remote control in the recharger as a good opportunity. The user interface designer agreed. The marketing representative thought it could be a square, just a packet. The industrial designer noted that they would have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharger as well.",
    "The group decided to table the microphone discussion and focus on speech-nonspeech segmentation and representation of overlaps. Regarding the microphones, one group member could not find a replacement for the uncomfortable head-worn mics that fit the connector. It was also mentioned that breathing is a terrible problem for recognition. DragonDictate placement helps an enormous amount by placing the mic to the side to avoid exhales through the nose. The group agreed that it doesn't hurt to have people wear the microphones properly, if possible.\n\nRegarding the nonuniformity of the microphones, the group did not reach a conclusion but discussed the possibility of using cross-correlation to determine voice activity. This would allow for better selection of who is talking, rather than setting any absolute threshold.",
    "During the meetings, Kirsty Williams AM emphasized that any decisions about reopening schools would prioritize the safety, physical, and emotional well-being of children, young people, and staff. She highlighted the need for clear communication with parents and staff, based on evidence and information, to build confidence and allow for planning. She also mentioned the practical challenges of social distancing, school transport, and workforce availability.\n\nRegarding support for students with emotional and mental health difficulties, Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged the potential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on mental health. She mentioned plans to make additional money available to local authorities to increase support services, including telephone and video support, remote counseling, and family therapy. She also emphasized the importance of professional development for counselors to adapt to new ways of working.\n\nConcerning studying from home, Kirsty Williams AM recognized the challenges faced by parents and emphasized the importance of not being too hard on themselves.

She also highlighted efforts to address digital disadvantage by providing hardware and connectivity to students.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer (I_D_) expressed several thoughts on the design, style, and functions of the new spherical remote control. The I_D_ emphasized the importance of a design that feels good in the hand, suggesting a curvature that matches the hand's natural shape. They raised the question of battery type (double A, triple A, or a small lithium battery) and its impact on the device's size and design.\n\nDuring the discussion, the I_D_ highlighted the need for easy-to-press buttons, as some remote controls have buttons that are too small and difficult to use. They also inquired about the scope of the remote, questioning whether it would be solely for televisions or a multi-functional device compatible with various systems like sound systems, DVD players, and VHS. Additionally, the I_D_ questioned whether they were designing the remote control itself or the accompanying instructions.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, here's the group's opinion on Erasmus and student tuition refunds:\n\n**Erasmus and Mobility Funding:** The group strongly supports participation in the Erasmus+ program and emphasizes its importance. They express concern about the potential impacts of Brexit on the scheme and highlight the need for a UK stand-alone project if access to Erasmus+ is lost. There's a consensus among the government, institutions, and students about the value of the program. Universities are encouraged to explore alternative funding sources for international mobility, potentially through their own fee incomes, but replacing Erasmus+ entirely with a national scheme is seen as less efficient.\n\n**Tuition Fee Refunds:** There is no discussion of any kind about whether students should be refunded some of their tuition fees.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on various local authoritative frameworks, condolences, employment, workers' safety, and pay dispute situations.\n\nCondolences were extended to the families of the six Canadian Armed Forces members who died in a helicopter crash.\n\nLocal authoritative frameworks were discussed with petitions to recognize indigenous languages as official languages, create a national opt-out program for organ donation, reform drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, and stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners.\n\nEmployment and workers' safety discussions included concerns about companies accessing the wage subsidy program, workers refusing unsafe work, matching students with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, and the government's response to businesses.\n\nPay dispute situations were discussed, including concerns about seniors on fixed incomes, sole proprietors falling through the cracks, meat-packing plants shutting down, the government's commitment to a $2.6 billion fund to maintain food security in Canada, and a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains.\n",
    "The reasons for expressing thanks to the House of Commons and the members of the Canadian Armed Forces from Whitehorse were twofold. First, the meeting was an opportunity to thank the government for the way it has managed the global crisis and its impact on Canadians. Canada is one of the few countries that has acted in the best interests of its citizens and maintained their dignity in these uncertain times. Second, the meeting was an opportunity to express condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea the previous week. It was noted that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief.",
    "The group discussed the functions, characters, and design requirements of a remote control. The technical designer stated that the remote control should be used only for television to keep things simple and that the design should be unique, incorporating the company's colors and slogan. The user interface designer emphasized the importance of must-have buttons like on/off, channel numbers, and volume control. There were also discussions about the possibility of including voice recognition, with marketing research showing that younger people are more likely to pay for it.\n\nThe group prioritized channel and volume selection as the most essential functions based on user data. The implementation of a scroll feature was discussed as a way to navigate channels and menus. The marketing member suggested that older people may not prefer the scroll feature. The group considered integrating the volume and channel controls into one button by pressing down. The use of an LCD screen was also discussed, with the consensus that it may be too expensive.\n",
    "The main topics of discussion in the first meeting transcript revolve around the design of a new television remote control. The team members introduce themselves, share initial ideas, and discuss the technical aspects, user interface, and marketing considerations. They also talk about the materials for the remote and the target selling price.

The group discusses the progress of the transcription process, the accuracy of automatic segmentations, and the need to move to production mode. They also touch on various methods for improving the speech recognition system, including adjusting insertion penalties, tuning Gaussian system size, and vocal tract length normalization. The team also talks about the need for participant approval of transcriptions and the challenges of ensuring accuracy and addressing potential legal issues. There is some discussion of repetitive strain injury (RSI) mentioned in the context of transcribers and the difficulty of keeping them on staff. The group also discusses the potential for using the transcriptions to create speech-nonspeech labels.\n",
    "The lab tests found that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, with 80% willing to spend more for a fancy design. However, 50% only use 10% of the buttons. Major frustrations included remotes getting lost and being difficult to learn.\n\nThe group discussed the \"finder\" button, suggesting a beeping function, potentially activated by a button on the TV. For the \"call\" button, they considered voice recognition, which was more popular with younger users (under 35).\n\nRegarding button design and location, there was talk of minimizing the number of buttons, focusing on essential functions like power, channel selection, and volume. Alternatives to traditional buttons, such as touch screens, were briefly considered.\n\nThe team agreed to target a younger demographic (15-35) with a sleek, simple design incorporating essential buttons and optional voice recognition. When discussing the presentation, they agreed to include a locator function, and a long battery life, perhaps even using solar power.\n",
    "The team focused on a remote control design, discussing prototypes, evaluation criteria, and finances. The industrial designer presented a prototype emphasizing ergonomic design with a molded shape, scroll wheel for volume, buttons for channels, and a prominent power key. They considered the use of lightweight plastic with rubbery, interchangeable covers for protection and customization.\n\nThe project manager reviewed the company's costing spreadsheet, aiming to stay within the budget of 12.5 units. They highlighted the voice sensor as a key feature, justifying the cost due to its fundamental role in the design. The team agreed that the innovative design and fashion-accessory concept justified potential minor cost compromises.\n\nThe team discussed the product's evaluation, assessing its ease of use, RSI impact, and appeal across age groups. They agreed the voice control and simplicity would attract older users, while younger users would appreciate the design and customization options. The team concluded that the project met management's requirements, stayed within budget, and fostered creativity and teamwork.\n",
    "The group discussed the specifications for a new remote control. One member proposed a simple and clear design, incorporating the latest chip features for compatibility with most televisions, while another member suggested that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward. The marketing person stated that people don't like current remote controls and that they don't match user behavior well. They agreed that buttons are easier for users but discussed potential alternatives like an LCD screen. They also debated whether to include video and DVD functions, with the final decision being to limit the remote control to television use only. There was no decision made on changeable cases.\n",
    "Councillor Huw David, representing the Welsh Local Government Association, firmly believes the state's primary role is to protect children from harm, aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. He views physical punishment as harmful and preventable. David emphasizes that this Bill reflects a cultural shift in Wales over the past 30-40 years, where most parents no longer support or use physical punishment.\n\nRegarding unintended consequences, David expresses hope that careful implementation with adequate resources will prevent them. He stresses the importance of cultural change and ensuring resources are available, given the overstretched social services departments dealing with serious harm and neglect cases. He highlights the need to support families through early intervention and prevention programs to avoid children being taken into care.\n\nDavid does not believe it should be explicitly stated in the Bill, as he trusts that Welsh Government will honor the commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, because parents must be taken along on this journey.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of the two-sided remote control's design and functionality.\n\n**Evaluation & Market Range:** The marketing expert suggested that if the remote control is sold on its own, it should be programmable for multiple devices to increase its appeal to consumers. They also emphasized the importance of focusing on different cultures and trends, aiming for an international market. The target selling price was set at twenty-five Euros, with a production cost limit of twelve and a half Euros, aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros.\n\n**Technical Requirements:** Waterproofing was considered but raised concerns about increasing production costs. The possibility of including a plastic protection or waterproof box, either optional or sold with the remote, was discussed. Another idea was to include a button on the TV that would make the remote control beep, aiding in locating it. The industrial designer suggested the remote should not be square and be shock-resistant.\n",
    "The discussions on amendments in group 3 centered on regulation-making powers related to section 1 of the Bill. The Deputy Minister sought to add existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent.\n\nSuzy Davies introduced amendment 3A as a probing amendment, suggesting that the Welsh Government might need broader regulatory powers than the \"transitory, transitional, and saving provisions\" currently provided. She felt the powers were not enough and that the Assembly should have an opportunity to bring anything the Welsh Government may wish to introduce under section 1 onto the floor of the Assembly.\n\nDavies proposed amending the Bill to grant the Welsh Government a more unrestricted power to make regulations, particularly considering the evolving nature of section 1. She emphasized the importance of the Assembly's role in scrutinizing any measures introduced under section 1 and sought reassurance about the type of procedure (negative or affirmative) that would be applied to such measures. The Deputy Minister stated that they did not think it necessary to have wider powers, but they will keep this under review coming up to Stage 3.\n",
    "Brexit's impact on Welsh higher education institutions is primarily seen in fee and access plans, with concerns arising from potential decreases in EU student enrollment. Executives are addressing this through contingency planning, promotion of Wales as a study destination via the Global Wales program, and advocacy for continued access to EU research funding programs like Horizon 2020. Individual institutions are developing scenarios to manage potential financial impacts, but these are not for public consumption because it would involve reducing costs and potentially eliminating jobs.\n\nThe meeting transcripts contain no questions or updates about the local production of surgical masks, protective gowns, and N95 masks, nor do they provide information on the status of projects awaiting government approval from the provinces in Canada.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the key points regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada are:\n\n*   **Support for Seniors:** Discussions revolve around increasing Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, providing GST credits, and ensuring financial security for seniors during the pandemic. Concerns are raised about fixed incomes, rising costs, and access to services for seniors.\n*   **Vulnerable People Protection:** Safeguards for vulnerable people requesting euthanasia, protecting indigenous languages, and addressing the opioid overdose crisis are highlighted.\n*   **Accessibility to benefits:** There are concerns that the eligibility criteria for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and other programs are too restrictive, leaving many vulnerable individuals, including low-income earners and those without traditional employment histories, without support.\n*   **Long-Term Care:** The devastating impact of COVID-19 on seniors in long-term care homes is a significant point, raising questions about federal responsibility and the need for improved care standards. The role of for-profit long-term care facilities and the need to remove profit from the system are discussed.\n*  **Additional funding:** There is concern that the additional funding is not enough and that the government should make additional adjustments to support people.",
    "The marketing expert believes the new remote control should have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find in a room, and robust. They suggest the product should be inspired by the latest fashion trends, including clothes and interior design, not just electronics.\n\nDuring the evaluation, the marketing expert rated the product highly on fashion due to its fruit shape, suggesting a score of seven. They also emphasized the importance of robustness and the need for a user-friendly design, highlighting that users often struggle to find the right buttons on existing remote controls. The expert prefers having the off button at the top right for better usability.\n\nThey also consider whether the remote should be universal or targeted.\n",
    "The meeting transcript primarily focused on discussions surrounding data collection, data processing, and potential research directions. The universal adoption of the Act was not discussed. The advantages of the Act were only touched upon in the context of firearm legislation and regulation. The Prime Minister stated that the Act would eliminate military-style assault weapons. The weaknesses of the Act were raised by another member, stating that experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety. Another member stated that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law.",
    "The group discussed evaluation criteria in the context of data collection for user interface design, focusing on how to gather information that would be helpful for querying meeting recordings. One suggestion was to use CrossPads for note-taking, allowing participants to write down notes and mark them. This would provide a summary and potential queries, but handwriting recognition quality was a concern.\n\nThe group explored different approaches to generating queries, including asking participants after the meeting for query ideas. However, the group acknowledged this might be unreliable due to reduced motivation. Another idea was to identify keywords like \"action item\" to help structure the data. Using summaries was suggested, but the group also realized they should record summaries instead of writing them.\n\nThe group discussed the idea of using a note-taker's notes, a common practice in many meetings, as a source of summaries and potential queries. The group ultimately decided to try CrossPads, take digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting, ask people to mention something interesting that they learned, and ask those people who are willing to stay afterwards to give an oral summary.\n",
    "The participants' opinions on using CD's for backup were that they are currently being used, with about two CD's being burned a day. There are some issues with missing files and the limited amount of time to do this. IBM is going to be sent the data on CD's and then transferred to analog tape for transcription.\n\nThe discussion on probability computation involved using increase in energy, the energy in the LPC residuals, and other measures. The idea of the manual marking was to determine, \"OK this, you know, it's it's really here.\" There is a project to infer from the close-talking mikes where the on-off points are of speech.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system is set up in a room where there are microphones placed on the table and headsets worn by the participants. These are used to record the audio of the meetings. The data is then used to train the computer navigation system. The goal is to have a system that can understand and respond to natural language.",
    "The group decided against positioning symmetrical buttons on both sides because, during the prototype presentation, it was pointed out that the current design favored right-handed users. While a suggestion was made to create a left-handed version, the team ultimately decided against it. This decision was influenced by the idea that left-handed individuals are accustomed to adapting to right-handed products. The team also reasoned that even right-handed users could operate the remote with their left hand, mitigating any significant ergonomic issues. The Project Manager suggested creating both right- and left-handed remotes, but it was decided against.\n",
    "The group discussed several strategies for cost reduction. Abandoning teletext and focusing solely on TV functionality, rather than a universal remote, would limit costs. Cutting back on the number of functions and buttons was a key consideration, as market research indicated that users only utilize a small percentage of the available features. The possibility of incorporating a \"Video Plus\" code system was discussed as an alternative to complex programming features, potentially reducing the need for numerous buttons. Production costs could be lowered by economies of scale. The group also explored alternative battery options, such as rechargeable batteries and a charging base, to reduce the ongoing cost and inconvenience of replacing traditional batteries. Finally, the group wanted to move away from the standard \"brown rectangle\" design of current remotes.\n",
    "The group discussed several pros and cons of using voice recognition. A pro was that the close-talking microphones made pitch features better than Switchboard, with less dropout and more reliable features. A con was that if recognition is run unconstrained on a whole waveform, it performs poorly because of insertions in places that may well be cut out. It was also noted that the features are optimized for phone discrimination, not for the final word error metric. The issue of background noise was also discussed, with the suggestion to retrain or adapt the models for background noise specific to the environment.\n",
    "The Industrial Designer (ID) contributed significantly to the discussion on battery options. Initially, the ID considered standard AA and AAA batteries too bulky. They explored alternative charging methods, including dynamo charging (deemed impractical), solar charging, and kinetic charging (similar to wrist watches). The ID noted that solar charging would require visible solar cells on the case, which might affect the design, and solar cells are not resistant to being dropped. They also noted that kinetic charging would likely provide enough power for a remote due to the limited draw on the battery.\n\nUltimately, the team decided on kinetic charging with a watch-type battery. The ID did not recommend a charger because kinetic charging would be sufficient. They noted that rechargeable options were unavailable, and the standard battery sizes were bulky. The ID also noted that the kinetic option was smaller and more modern.\n",
    "The reasons for including the project in a conference paper are multifaceted, stemming from both the practical aspects of efficient data management and the potential contributions to linguistic and speech recognition research. \n\nOne key reason is to streamline data handling by establishing consistent naming conventions for files, ensuring that filenames are of a fixed length to facilitate sorting and extraction of relevant information. This standardization is seen as crucial for organizing the growing volume of meeting recordings and transcriptions.\n\nBeyond data management, the project's inclusion in a conference paper is motivated by the insights it can offer into various areas of speech and language processing. These include the study of speaker overlaps, the development of robust speech recognition systems, and the exploration of prosodic features in conversational interactions. Furthermore, the project aims to address the challenges posed by real-world meeting conditions, such as background noise and reverberation, which are often absent in more controlled datasets.\n\nThe potential for collaboration with other researchers, such as those interested in inference structures and the analysis of acoustic events, further supports the project's inclusion in a conference paper. By sharing the data and findings, the project aims to foster interdisciplinary research and contribute to a deeper understanding of human communication in meeting settings.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams did not directly comment on the funding allocated to the consortia or respond to university mergers within the provided transcripts. However, she addressed concerns regarding university governance by emphasizing the autonomous nature of higher education institutions and stated that they guard that principle jealously.\nRegarding admission problems in Welsh universities, Williams acknowledged the drop in EU student applications and attributed it to changes in government policy concerning tuition fee grants. She expressed concern about this decline and highlighted the need for universities to attract students from both the EU and around the world. Williams also pointed out the imbalanced higher education profile in Wales compared to other UK countries, with only one high-tariff university, and suggested that Swansea University's success could be a model for others.\nProposed solutions included working with HEFCW and individual institutions to test their preparedness, investing in the Global Wales program to increase international marketing, and ensuring a sustainable way of funding the HE sector through the implementation of Diamond. Williams also mentioned ongoing discussions about how to beef up research and engage with UK Research and Innovation to ensure Wales is competitive in bidding for research money.",
    "The team extensively discussed and evaluated a prototype remote control. The design incorporated a gunmetal gray plastic base with a thumb-shaped design and black labeling.\n\nRegarding the energy source, the team decided to power the remote with a lithium battery due to the target audience being technologically advanced. A voice sensor was included, impacting the technology costs.\n\nTechnologically, the team evaluated the remote on its innovation, considering voice recognition capabilities, but acknowledging it was limited to television functionality. The team also debated incorporating an integrated scroll wheel or push-buttons.\n\nOverall, the team was satisfied with the project and the prototype, believing it met the criteria for ease of use, fashionability, and technological innovation. The team felt the remote was trendy, met the user requirements, and fit within the allocated budget.\n",
    "The group discussed several technical aspects of the project. Regarding energy sources, they considered batteries, hand dynamos, kinetic energy, and solar cells, ultimately deciding on batteries for the remote control.\n\nThere was discussion about a sample sensor and speaker chip that had been developed, but the team was unsure how to implement the technology and whether it would be too expensive. They debated the pros and cons of voice recognition technology.\n\nRegarding the project announcement email, it was only briefly mentioned in the context of spam.\n\nThere were discussions about improving the quality of the audio recordings for the meetings. It was suggested that close-talking microphones be used by each speaker.\n",
    "The last meeting focused on evaluating the prototype of a remote control. The key points discussed included the cost aspect, project evaluation based on user requirements and market trends, and the overall feasibility of the product.\n\nProblems reviewed included determining a common rating for the prototype's features, such as its fancy look and feel, fashion, ease of use, and robustness. There was some debate about whether the design was truly innovative, with the industrial designer noting that aside from the wheel, there wasn't much innovation. The inclusion of voice control was discussed but ultimately excluded from the current prototype. The meeting concluded that the cost was within budget, and the evaluation was satisfactory, leading to a positive outlook for the project's future.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns about the childcare offer. David questioned the \u00a34.50 single national rate, suggesting it might create a two-tiered system akin to EasyJet, where basic care is provided, but wealthier parents can afford better care through add-ons. He worried about affordability for the lowest-income working families, who would be disproportionately affected by the cost of add-ons like transport and food. Irranca-Davies acknowledged this concern, stating that in an ideal world with unlimited funds, the offer would be more equitable.\n\nBoth expressed apprehension about capacity, particularly in Cardiff and Newport, given higher operating costs. David inquired about pilot programs in these areas, with Irranca-Davies confirming plans to roll out the offer there to assess its viability. They also discussed workforce qualification and quality, balancing the desire to improve the workforce with maintaining the \u00a34.50 rate. Irranca-Davies emphasized the importance of registered, inspected providers to ensure quality and socialisation, as opposed to simply child-minding by unregistered family members.\n",
    "The discussion covered online and phase normalization. Regarding online normalization, PhD C has been working to improve an anharmonicity detector, but is encountering problems distinguishing between harmonics and other frequency peaks. Professor A suggested using a \"sieve\" approach, hypothesizing frequencies and looking at energy multiples. PhD C planned to present results on harmonicity the following week.\n\nRegarding phase normalization, PhD C is working with the phase derivative in the 0-4 kHz band, observing how the spectrum concentrates around harmonics. However, a rule proposed in a paper regarding instantaneous frequency of continuous filters isn't working. Professor A expressed curiosity but lacked time to review the paper. There is no explicit opinion of the professor on phase normalization and quals mentioned in the transcripts.",
    "The discussion focused on methods for detecting important linguistic features, particularly for overlaps. Professor G mentioned a suggestion from colleagues in Spain to broaden the existing system by including non-silence boundaries as potential speaker change points, rather than solely relying on silence. This would leverage the existing Gaussian and HMM superstructure.\n\nThe use of Noisy-OR was not explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe formalization of overlaps in the transcription was discussed at length. Due to interface limitations, overlaps were not being encoded in complete detail. The ideal solution was considered to be a musical score notation. Dave Gelbart had ideas for interface modifications. In the meantime, the team decided to move forward with the existing interface, acknowledging the limitations in capturing the fine-grained time scale of overlaps. There was also a mention of creating separate output files for each channel to better preserve overlaps and fulfill a request for easily separable channels.",
    "The meetings discussed system involvement in demos, backups, and collecting notes. For demos, the group discussed a mock question-answering system using pre-stored data alongside a transcriber interface for a DARPA meeting in July. For backups, it was noted that they were running out of disk space.\n\nNote-taking was discussed at length, with multiple potential sources including CrossPads, digital photos of boards, and summaries. It was mentioned that a summary is a reasonable bootstrap into figuring out queries. One suggestion was to ask meeting participants to mention something interesting they learned to pick up micro-structures not captured in summaries. Oral summaries were proposed to capture multiple perspectives quickly. There was a consensus against requiring summaries to avoid burdening participants.\n\nProfessor A suggested that the summaries actually may help get to queries. Summaries could be used to run a word frequency count to see what words come up in different types of meetings. Professor A believes that in many meetings there will be some sort of note-taking, in which case, that 's a useful thing to have. Professor A does not want to require note-taking because the more things that can be gotten for, the more useful it will be for various applications.\n",
    "The discussion about HMRC centered around the Welsh Government's decision to discontinue working with them on the childcare offer. Julie Morgan stated that the decision was primarily driven by the desire for a more flexible and expandable offer, which HMRC would have restricted. There were also concerns about HMRC's ability to fully meet Welsh language standards.\n\nNicola Edwards elaborated on the technical issues, explaining that HMRC's bilingual service, based on their Welsh language scheme, differed significantly from the requirements of the Welsh language standards that Welsh Ministers must adhere to. These issues included challenges with the multiple IT systems and \"special characters\" in the Welsh alphabet.\n\nJo-anne Daniels added that the costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than initially outlined, leading to the conclusion that a cheaper and more flexible system could be delivered by working with local authorities. She also emphasized that investing in local authorities would retain more of the investment within Wales. Julie Morgan defended the decision, stating that the work with HMRC helped highlight the direction the Welsh Government needed to take.\n",
    "Professor A commented on the digits workshop that there's nothing natural about reading numbers in the way Liz is trying to get the transcribers to read them to get natural groupings. He felt they should defer to Liz since she asked for it specifically. Grad B said Liz felt it was very natural to chunk numbers that way.\n\nThe team did not provide feedback on the person in Grenada in the provided text.\n\nThe required elements in the new form arrangement were to have the speaker ID, session information, information on the microphones, and information on the channels. Grad B wanted each element to be a fixed length to make sorting easier.\n\nThe suggested structure of the belief net was not discussed in the provided text.\n\nGrad B's opinion on the belief net structure was not mentioned in the provided text.\n",
    "Grad E and Grad A did not express their opinions regarding the goals and outcomes of their respective experiments in the provided transcripts. There was a mention of Dave working on things with digits, but Grad A's opinion was not recorded. Grad E mentions the training of a speech-nonspeech detector, but does not explicitly state their opinion regarding the outcomes of their experiment.\n",
    "The User Interface (UI) representative favored a remote control with fewer buttons and simpler functionality, suggesting a rolling button for navigation. They initially leaned towards infrared (IR) technology for cost and simplicity, despite radio waves (RW) offering the advantage of not needing direct alignment with the device. The UI was concerned about potential radio wave interference with other appliances and neighbors' devices.\n\nThe final design decisions leaned towards incorporating a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, rechargeable batteries, and a design that was ergonomic, easy to hold, and inspired by organic shapes. The team decided against the initial idea of RW and opted for a remote with a simple design to appeal to a wide range of users, with special attention to younger users. The extra budget will likely be used for the new speech recognition software, and for high-quality, trendy materials.\n",
    "Professor B discussed the effect of noise on speech frequencies, noise addition, smoothing, FIR filters, and dealing with additive noise. He mentioned an interesting technique suggested by Dennis Klatt, which involves adding noise to everything, thereby making any additive noise less effective. However, he cautioned that adding too much noise could negatively impact clean recognition.\n\nProfessor B highlighted the work being done at OGI on noise separation, aiming to provide a better initial estimate of the mel spectrum that would be more robust to noise. He mentioned exploring the use of the spectrum from the LPC model instead of the Fourier transform, as suggested by Bill Byrne, with the idea that the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum, potentially making it more robust in noise.\n\nProfessor B noted that the LDA filter is not optimal when noise compensation is used. They found that using an older LDA filter led to better recognition rates on noisy speech when the system was trained on clean speech.",
    "The team discussed the remote control's functions, particularly focusing on kinetic energy and channel navigation.\n\nThe industrial designer introduced the idea of using kinetic energy to power the remote, suggesting that shaking or moving it would generate power, a retro-style concept. However, concerns were raised about the practicality of this, especially during movie watching when minimal movement occurs. The team considered combining kinetic energy with traditional batteries for a more reliable power source.\n\nRegarding channel navigation, the user interface designer mentioned previous ideas of voice recognition and a round button for channel programming and volume control. The team explored scroll-wheels as a potential interface element, but also discussed the possibility of integrating a scroll-bar on the side of the remote for volume control. The marketing representative added that voice recognition was a selling point to younger customers.\n",
    "The team proposed a universal remote control design, prioritizing user-friendliness and a trendy, fashionable appearance. The industrial designer suggested a banana-shaped case made of spongy rubber with a user-friendly interface. They also suggested the device be small so that it is easy to carry around.\n\nMarketing agreed that the remote control should have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find, and robust. The team rated the prototype against these criteria, with marketing giving a rating of six for the fancy and fashionable aspects. \n\nThe industrial designer also proposed incorporating a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost, which marketing research had identified as a key user frustration. Marketing agreed that the product's marketable aspect was strong, particularly its potential to stand out from existing remote controls and its potential to appeal to a wide range of consumers.\n",
    "Grad G felt that misread digits should be thrown out and reread. They suggested switching between \"zero\" and \"O\" to determine the best version to use. Grad G thought the CrossPad and speech combination was interesting and liked the idea of determining interesting points by looking at who was writing. The professor agreed with the easy way of dealing with misread digits. They thought that it was nice to know what studies people would be doing on speaker-dependent things. The professor's only thought on digits was related to natural groupings. They thought it would be ideal to have a breath extractor. The professor did not like the term \"intentions\" that Johno used. Regarding Fey, Grad D asked if Lila knew how to put her on the payroll. Professor B thought Fey sounded fine and was more present than in conversation.",
    "The Industrial Designer shared several thoughts regarding the remote control design and technologies. They highlighted the importance of speech recognition and LCD screens. The Industrial Designer noted that LCDs are useful for user feedback, but the feedback could also come through the television itself, which might negate the need for an LCD on the remote. They also explored various material options for the remote's casing, including rubber, titanium, wood, and plastic. The Industrial Designer noted that push-buttons are their expertise, but they may be out of trend. They also shared information about sample senders and sample speakers that their company produces that would give feedback when a button is pushed.\n",
    "The discussions on the priority of inspections centered around ensuring the safety of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly concerning food supply chains and long-term care facilities. The reopening of the House of Commons was discussed in relation to Canada's diplomatic relations, specifically regarding Taiwan's role in the World Health Organization and the repatriation of Canadians abroad. The allocation of funds and addressing systematic racism involved discussions on supporting marginalized communities, reforming institutions like the police, and collecting race-based data to quantify and address injustice.\n\nJassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders did not participate in the meetings. Thus, there was no discussion or agreement between them on the priority of inspections.\n\nJustin Trudeau elaborated on the governmental fund by emphasizing the importance of supporting workers and families during the crisis, particularly the most vulnerable. He highlighted the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and other measures for students, seniors, farmers, and agricultural producers. Regarding the revolution in national institutions, Trudeau acknowledged the need to address systemic racism and work towards social justice for all Canadians but did not provide specific details on reforms.\n",
    "The group's discussion of the remote control's design covered several key areas. The technical design, led by the user interface team, focused on the components and processes within the remote, including the chip, infrared terminal, and energy source. They aimed for simplicity and compatibility with most televisions while incorporating the company's color and slogan. The functional design, presented by the industrial designer, explored user needs and functionalities, drawing inspiration from existing remote controls. They prioritized essential functions like on/off, channel switching, and volume control, and debated the inclusion of additional features like DVD/VCR operation.\n\nThe prototype presentation highlighted findings from a user survey. The marketing team shared data indicating that users found current remote controls lacking, primarily using only a small percentage of the buttons. They proposed a sleek, stylish design, emphasizing essential functions, and explored the potential of voice recognition, particularly among younger demographics.\n\nSpecific designing requirements included considerations for ergonomics, battery life (exploring options like solar power), and a locator feature. The group discussed the target audience, ultimately deciding on the 15-35 age range, and the balance between traditional buttons and voice recognition technology. They also considered the potential for a beeper button on the TV to help locate the remote.\n",
    "The team's discussion about the project's process, work division, and production plan reveals a focus on meeting requirements and addressing potential issues. The team members generally felt they worked well together and allowed themselves as much creativity as the product allowed.\n\nThe team discussed the product's design, focusing on its potential for standing upright and broadening the base for stability. They also touched on the materials used, aiming for a lightweight plastic with a rubbery cover.\n\nRegarding the financial aspect, the project manager stated that they're on target with the costings and can argue for any slight compromises due to the innovative nature and fashion accessory concept. The team evaluated the product against criteria like ease of use, ergonomics, and appeal to different age groups, expressing confidence in its potential success.\n\nThe team also discussed the transcription process, addressing issues like attrition among transcribers and strategies for maintaining a leaner staff. They explored ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency of transcriptions, including using automatic segmentations and retraining models for background noise. The team also discussed the importance of participant approval for transcriptions, considering legal implications and the need for accurate representation of the meetings.\n",
    "The discussion on future directions involved summarization, hot spots in meetings, and multiple domains to analyze. PhD D explained his multilingual model, and PhD C and the professor discussed the need for multiple languages in the data. The group discussed releasing the meeting data, but there were concerns about privacy and the difficulty of anonymizing the data. They considered bleeping out names or having multiple versions of the release. The group also discussed the possibility of allowing people to cut things out of the data, but there were concerns about maintaining a consistent licensing policy.",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement about the gap between program development and its implementation refers to the government's struggle to effectively deliver the support that Canadians need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the development of various programs like CERB, EI, and wage subsidies, many vulnerable individuals are still falling through the cracks due to restrictive eligibility criteria and complicated application processes. This suggests that the design and intention of the programs are not fully translating into tangible assistance for those who need it most. The Prime Minister admitted fixed incomes for some are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing.",
    "The Project Manager (PM) did not give explicit views on the last meeting review or market research in the provided transcripts. However, the PM seemed satisfied with the project evaluation, stating that the cost was within budget and the evaluation was \"okay,\" suggesting a positive perception of the marketing expert's work.\n\nReflecting on the meetings, the PM appeared focused on keeping the project on track and within budget. The PM emphasized the need to move efficiently through tasks and discouraged excessive brainstorming.\n\nThe group's opinion differed from the PM's in that they wanted to explore different ideas and possibilities. For example, the group questioned the practicality of the twenty-five Euro price point, given the uncertainty about the product's features and target market.\n\nRegarding the panther drawing, the transcripts reveal that the marketing team member, Guillermo, wanted to draw a panther. However, the industrial designer questioned the ease of drawing it.\n",
    "The team had varied thoughts on the remote control's features.\n\nButtons for multiple operations: The team agreed that push-buttons were necessary, especially for channel numbers, but the scrolling wheel would also be useful for functions that are not often used.\n\nLCD screen: The team was in favor of including an LCD screen, but it would have to be an advanced chip.\n\nMicrophone position: There was no discussion on the position of the microphone.\n\nPush-buttons in relation to the key concepts: The team agreed that push-buttons would be on the outside, and on the inside there would be an LCD with a spinning wheel. The remote would incorporate voice recognition as well.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\n*   **Sharp decline in revenue:** Tourism-based communities experienced high unemployment rates as seasonal businesses were at risk of losing their entire season.\n*   **Ineligibility for federal support programs:** Businesses, particularly seasonal ones, did not qualify for programs like the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) because they did not meet the payroll requirements or had unique revenue cycles.\n*   **Border restrictions and travel limitations:** Restrictions on non-essential travel affected tourism, especially in regions dependent on cross-border visitors.\n*   **Uncertainty about economic recovery:** Businesses expressed anxiety about the hard economic recovery after the pandemic.\n\nThe government took the following measures to mitigate the impact:\n\n*   **Financial support:** The government introduced measures like the CEBA, wage subsidies, and regional development agency funding.\n*   **Sector-specific aid:** A tourism-specific aid package was planned to help businesses in the sector.\n*   **Collaboration with provinces and territories:** The federal government engaged with provinces and territories to coordinate efforts and address specific regional needs.\n*   **Support for food processors:** Investments were made to support food processors and help them manage challenges related to COVID-19.\n*   **Support for harvesters:** The government ensured seasonal workers were able to access CERB.\n\n",
    "The industrial designer presented a working design focusing on functionality over fancy features. The basic function of a remote control is to send messages to a fixed system. The components include an energy source feeding an integrated circuit (chip) that composes messages, usually through infrared. The design includes an on/off button and channel selection.\n\nThe user interface designer focused on the technical functions, emphasizing ease of use and conventional layouts. The main functions are sending messages to the TV, switching on/off, channel selection (next channel, specific channel numbers), and volume control. A menu button could control other functions like brightness. The industrial designer suggested buttons are the easiest to use, but this is not settled.\n\nThe marketing representative discussed user research, indicating that users want something different from current remotes, and prefer channel selection and volume control. Ergonomic design to prevent repetitive strain injury was suggested. Younger users are more willing to pay for voice recognition, which would be sleek and stylish. A locator function and long battery life (possibly solar-powered) were also proposed.\n\nThe target demographic was decided to be 15-35 year olds. The remote will be sleek, have key buttons for ease of use, and voice recognition as an option. No final decision was made on a prototype.\n",
    "The DARPA meeting is scheduled for mid-July, and the team wants to be in \"production mode\" by then, with a transcription stream and knowledge of its performance.\n\nThe team discussed the contents of a paper, and the paper includes information about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meetings. The paper also includes information about a spreadsheet with start time, the date, the old meeting name, the new meeting name, the number of speakers, the duration of the meeting, comments, and transcription status.\n\nAs of Monday, the fourteenth, there were a total of sixty-two hours of meetings collected.",
    "The group decided to throw out misread digits in the corpus and have someone else reread them. They agreed to keep the digit collection process as suggested by Liz, focusing on natural groupings of numbers. The group also touched upon the NSF ITR proposal, which focuses on higher-level meeting mappings.\n\nThe group discussed naming conventions, agreeing to standardize the length of filenames for easier sorting. Jane mentioned that she had switched to channel-by-channel transcription to provide tighter time bins.\n\nThe group also discussed how to handle breaths in the transcripts. It was decided not to remove breaths from the corpus, but rather to develop methods for blocking them if needed. There was a question about the possibility of automatically encoding breaths to save time for the transcribers.\n",
    "In the meeting transcripts, there was no mention of \"triple R\" or \"triple RC\" as potential product names.\n\nRegarding the target age group, the initial discussion leaned towards targeting teenagers and young professionals (15-35 years old) due to their willingness to pay more for features like screen and speech recognition. However, later discussions considered targeting the 40+ age group, as they constitute a significant portion of the market and might appreciate a simpler, user-friendly remote. The conclusion was not definitive, but there was a shift towards focusing on the elderly, with the possibility of designing a remote specifically for them.\n\nThe marketing team considered targeting young people because they are more open to new technologies and are more likely to spend money on advanced features.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection involved the number of buttons, the inclusion of teletext, and whether to implement a scroll button or joystick-like control. The team discussed the pros and cons of a display screen and whether it was needed. The conclusion was not definitive, but the team agreed to research what elderly people like to have.\n",
    "The group explored market research indicating users find remotes hideous and lose them frequently. They agreed on a plastic casing for aesthetic appeal and cost-effectiveness, with consideration for modern polymers.\n\nDesired features included basic functions like channel changing and volume control, with younger demographics favoring voice recognition. The user interface was envisioned to be simple, possibly with a touch screen and submenus for advanced settings.\n\nDesign opinions leaned towards a sleek, fashionable look to align with the slogan \"we put fashion in electronics\", targeting a younger demographic. The necessity of revolution in remote control interaction was discussed, with ideas like voice activation for basic controls and a paging system for locating lost remotes. The group discussed a possible touch screen with several submenus provisionally.\n",
    "Kirsty Williams AM addressed several key areas in the meeting transcripts. Regarding quality assurance, she emphasized the importance of co-construction with the profession, using existing infrastructure to refine the curriculum based on feedback. Bethan Owen's comment on the high-risk category was not mentioned in the meeting transcripts provided.\n\nThe five principles for reopening schools focused on safety and well-being, the wider Welsh Government response, clear communication, identifying specific groups of children, and operationalizing safety measures. Expectations for new examinations and school qualifications involved teachers submitting grades based on their professional judgment, followed by moderation to ensure fairness and robustness.\n\nIn response to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions, Kirsty Williams AM clarified that restrictions were not being relaxed imminently and emphasized that any changes would be based on scientific advice and sufficient planning. She highlighted the responsibility to plan for the future while prioritizing safety and providing clarity to the education sector.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, the team had both positive and negative experiences during the production process.\n\n**Likes:**\n\n*   **Innovative Design:** The team was proud of the remote's unique design and how it met the criteria of being different and fashionable.\n*   **Ease of Use:** The team believed the product was easy to use, especially with the voice control feature, appealing to a wide range of users, including older individuals.\n*   **Teamwork:** Team members generally worked well together, sharing ideas and reaching consensus.\n*   **Technology:** The team was satisfied with the technology used and found new ideas during the process. The use of laptops and a shared network were also appreciated.\n*   **Meeting Management's Requirements:** The team was happy that they met the requirements of the management team.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n*   **Creativity Restrictions:** Some felt stifled by the company's initial restriction of the product being solely a TV remote.\n*   **Survey and Digital Pens:** While some found them fun, others found the surveys and digital pens annoying or irritating.\n*   **Materials:** The materials were not exactly what the team had initially wanted.",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments centered around its potential impact on word error rates and signal-to-noise ratios. It was observed that mean subtraction seemed to make PZM signals louder after re-synthesis, leading to the question of whether it acted as a gain control. While simply amplifying the signal shouldn't affect performance, improving the signal-to-noise ratio through mean subtraction could be beneficial.\n\nOne concern raised was that the process of subtracting averages over multiple windows (up to twelve seconds) could introduce artifacts, particularly in low-energy portions of the speech. This could lead to the subtraction of components influenced by events seconds away, potentially creating \"echoes\" or \"pre-echoes\" that negatively affect recognition.\n\nThe group considered alternative approaches, such as voice activity detection (VAD) to remove low-energy sections and high-pass filtering to reduce reverberation effects. The discussion also touched on the importance of normalization and the potential for missing normalization steps to skew results.",
    "The discussion covered several topics. Mixed signals were touched upon when Postdoc F mentioned audio monitoring and spikes in recordings. Improvements to the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) were discussed with Thilo's breakthrough in channel-based speech/non-speech segmentation. The results of running the recognizer on different channels were mentioned by Phd A, focusing on energy normalization across channels. Opinions on new headphones were not explicitly stated, but there was a general consensus to order more comfortable wireless headsets. Alternative methods to increase space were not discussed, however, the group touched on the disk space running out. The deadline for the bleep editing was not explicitly mentioned.",
    "Special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement as locations for vulnerable children and children of key workers. They will provide planned activities, including educational, cultural, and sporting options, tailored to the children's age ranges. The regional consortia evaluate where the resources are located and what the impact of the resource has been.\n\nIn relation to schools with PDG for looked-after children, special schools, if they have such children attending, would also be eligible for PDG support. Special schools will also use this funding for attachment disorder training. The regional consortia are responsible for ensuring that the money is used to support and provide capacity building.\n",
    "The User Interface Designer, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager introduced the idea of creating a multifunctional remote control compatible with various devices like TVs, DVD players, VHS players, and TiVo. The discussion emphasized the importance of making it truly universal, addressing the common issue where universal remotes often fail to work with all devices, especially lesser-known brands.\n\nTo achieve this, they recognized the need to cover different signal variances and include an exceptionally detailed instruction booklet for easy configuration. The design should be comfortable to hold, with a curvature that fits the hand. Battery options like double-A, triple-A, or small lithium batteries were considered, acknowledging the trade-offs between size and power. The team agreed that the industrial designer would focus on the remote's working design and functionality.\n",
    "During the prototype evaluation, the Industrial Designer commented on several aspects of the design. Regarding the appearance, they noted that apart from the wheel, there wasn't much innovation in the design. They also mentioned the rubber material, agreeing that it made the product robust.\n\nIn the discussion about the structure, the Industrial Designer suggested broadening the base of the prototype so it could stand upright, especially if it was to be considered a fashion item. They also considered lengthening the design so it would come down to the base of the hand and then flatten out so that it could sit on a surface.\n\nConcerning customer preferences, the Industrial Designer referred to data indicating older people might be less willing to pay extra for increased functionality, but the ease of use could compensate. They also believed the product would appeal more to younger age groups due to their greater awareness of fashion aspects, while still appealing to everyone on some level.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, here's an overview of the topics you asked about:\n\n**Allocation of $75 Million:** The transcripts do not mention the allocation of $75 million towards addressing sexual exploitation and human trafficking.\n\n**Solution to Risk Appetite:** The transcripts do not directly discuss a solution to risk appetite.\n\n**Hon. Chrystia Freeland's Perspective on Systemic Racism:** Freeland acknowledged that systemic racism exists, particularly against Indigenous people, and that racial profiling is inappropriate. She mentioned the importance of reviewing the use of force by the RCMP and expressed support for the Prime Minister's conversations with the RCMP on this issue. However, she didn't commit to specific actions like prohibiting racial profiling at the federal level.\n",
    "The segmenter, presumably Thilo's segmenter, is working well and is being used to generate automatic segmentations for meeting recognition. The goal is to move away from hand-segmentations, which were previously used as the basis for recognition experiments. The segmenter has high recall, which is beneficial because over-generation allows for training noise models in the recognizer. The recognizer alignments are also being used to train the speech detector, reducing the need for hand labeling. There is also work being done to evaluate recognition results using the segmenter's output, without \"cheating\" by using hand segmentations. A new version of beeps, separated by spoken digits, was created to help transcribers keep track of their position in the file.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts:\n\n*   **Price Disagreement:** The Industrial Designer likely disagreed on the initial price because the User Interface designer suggested a price based on banana-shaped wireless phones costing 100-200 Euros. The Industrial Designer countered that the complexity of a phone is much greater than that of a remote control, implying the UI's price point was unrealistic.\n*   **Redesign Disagreement:** The transcript does not explicitly state a disagreement on the redesign after product evaluation.\n*   **Color Suggestion:** The transcript does not indicate why the User Interface suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance.\n*   **Shape Disagreement:** The Marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the product's fruit shape because they felt it was too limiting. They argued that companies launching fruit-shaped products typically offer a range of shapes, not just one or two. The Marketing expert believed that limiting the design to only banana and orange shapes might deter customers who don't like those fruits.",
    "Kay Martin, Principal of Cardiff and Vale College, echoes the sentiment that employers primarily seek candidates with specific qualifications relevant to their industry (e.g., engineering qualifications for engineers). She notes that employers prioritize literacy, numeracy, and digital skills alongside these qualifications. Martin also mentions that employers find navigating the complexities of apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales challenging enough, without needing to fully understand the Welsh bac.\n\nDafydd Evans, Chair of ColegauCymru, believes employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh bac's meaning and content, and feels the name is unhelpful. He suggests \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" is a more understandable title. Evans emphasizes that while larger employers might have the resources to follow educational policy changes, most smaller businesses are too focused on day-to-day operations to grasp the value of the Welsh bac.\n\nNick Brazil, Deputy Principal of Gower College Swansea, reports that employers rarely specifically request the Welsh bac. Instead, they focus on professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those sectors. Brazil acknowledges the initial vision for the Welsh bac was good, but feels it has become overly rigorous and bureaucratic, questioning whether it effectively develops skills employers need.\n",
    "The team generated several ideas for the remote control's function and design. Functionally, there was a discussion about including features beyond just television control, such as VCR and DVD player compatibility, but the decision was made to focus solely on television to keep the design simple. The team also considered incorporating the company's color scheme and slogan for brand recognition.\n\nAdditional ideas included voice recognition, particularly popular among younger demographics, and a locator function to help users find the remote when it's lost. One team member suggested a beeper activated by a button on the TV. The user interface design aimed for simplicity and ease of use, with essential buttons like power, channel selection, and volume. The team discussed whether to use buttons or a screen but favored buttons for their familiarity. They also explored the possibility of voice control replacing buttons entirely but agreed it was not yet feasible. The team targeted a younger audience (15-35) and decided to incorporate sleek and stylish design elements.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager had the following thoughts:\n\n*   **Market Range and Price:** The Project Manager emphasized a target selling price of 25 Euros for the remote control, aiming for a profit of 50 million Euros. They acknowledged the need for market research to determine what people are willing to pay for and what kind of product they would expect at that price point.\n*   **New Features:** The Project Manager was concerned about budget limitations and preferred cheaper options that still achieved the same goals.\n*   **Multipurpose Remote Control:** The Project Manager stated that the project was for a TV remote control only, not a combined control.\n*   **Cost Constraints and Financial Targets:** The Project Manager set a target selling price of 25 Euros with a goal of generating a profit of 50 million Euros.\n*   **Selling Target:** The Project Manager wanted to know more about the target audience and where they would be focusing their marketing.\n*   **Target Market Group:** The Project Manager wanted marketing to determine the direction they should go.\n\n",
    "User Interface (UI) had several thoughts regarding the cost constraints, financial targets, and kinetic battery replacement in the new remote control project.\n\nFirstly, UI expressed concern over the cost of implementing advanced features like LCD screens, questioning whether they would fit within the budget of twenty-five Euros per unit and a twelve Euros fifty manufacturing cost. UI was also wary about the speech recognition feature and its potential impact on the budget.\n\nSecondly, regarding financial targets, UI acknowledged the importance of meeting customer demands for quality and design, even if it meant slightly increasing costs. However, UI remained cautious about the overall budget and whether advanced technologies could be incorporated without exceeding it.\n\nThirdly, UI initially supported the idea of replacing traditional batteries with a kinetic power supply, citing environmental friendliness and convenience. However, UI raised concerns about the practicality of kinetic power, questioning whether users would be willing to shake the remote to power it, especially if it was left idle for extended periods.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, disagreements between Marketing and the Industrial Designer stemmed from differing visions for future product ideas, particularly regarding the use of kinetic energy and product upgradability.\n\nMarketing emphasized user-friendliness, market research findings (users dislike current remote designs, a desire for fancy designs, and frustration with lost remotes), cost-effectiveness, and a focus on a specific target audience (younger, business-oriented individuals). They also expressed concerns about repetitive strain injuries and the need for ergonomic designs.\n\nThe Industrial Designer, on the other hand, seemed more focused on technical aspects, innovative features (like kinetic energy), and future-proofing the product through upgradability. This difference in perspective likely led to disagreements on whether to prioritize simplicity and cost (favored by Marketing) or advanced technology and long-term value (favored by the Industrial Designer).\n",
    "The transcripts do not contain discussions or decisions regarding HEFCW's powers of intervention or conversations with FE and HE about closure decisions. The discussion focused on financial sustainability, monitoring university finances, and risk assessments. While HEFCW's role in overseeing university finances and governance was discussed, the specific powers of intervention and closure decisions were not addressed.\n",
    "The group's marketing strategy centers around a product with a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, a fashionable design, ease of finding, and robustness. They aim to achieve this with a yellow, banana-shaped case made of rubber material. The product will have a voice sensor, push buttons, and a simple slider for user interface. The design is intended to be lightweight and ergonomic, appealing to a wide range of age groups.\n\nFinancially, they plan to sell the product at twenty-five Euros, aiming to make a profit by keeping costs below their threshold. The cost is twelve point five, exactly on target, with the evaluation being okay. They believe the innovative and different concept, along with interchangeable covers, will offset any slight compromises on cost. The group intends to argue that the product's technological innovation and fashion accessory appeal justify any cost deviations, ultimately meeting both consumer and management requirements.",
    "The meeting transcript discusses policies, measures, physical education, and food provision for free-school-meal children during the pandemic. The Education Minister confirms that schools will play an important part in providing safe and secure places for children. Schools and local authorities are developing plans to provide emergency responses to families expecting free school meals. There may be sporting activities, but it will not be a formal curriculum. The minister also notes that they are trying to create a system where ongoing provision is available during term time and holidays. The government aims to ensure seamless support, recognizing the needs of frontline workers who require childcare.\n",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and an ergonomic design for the remote control to make it comfortable, innovative, and different from other remotes on the market. The goal was to create something that would stand out and be appealing.\n\nThe reasons for agreeing on \"easy to use,\" \"fashion,\" \"easy to find,\" and \"robust\" features were driven by market trends and user requirements. \"Easy to use\" was a priority for consumers, while \"fashion\" aligned with the company's motto. The \"easy to find\" feature was addressed by considering bright colors and a design that wouldn't easily slip between couch cushions. \"Robust\" was important for durability.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by considering its aesthetic appeal, minimalist design, and overall look. The team discussed whether the remote looked fancy, stylish, or elegant. They also considered the use of yellow with black buttons, which aligned with the company colors, and explored different shapes, such as a banana shape or a more abstract curved design.\n"
