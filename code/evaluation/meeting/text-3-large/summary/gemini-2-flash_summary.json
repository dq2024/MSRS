    "According to the group, a change was needed to ensure a representative speaker base. Some members felt that random postings for participants could lead to a \"mixed bag\" of English proficiency, potentially hindering language model development. They suggested targeting linguistics graduate students or professors to ensure a higher level of fluency. They also agreed that the advertisement should state that the meetings should be held in English.\n\nProfessor D acknowledged the need for fluent English speakers but also highlighted the value of including speakers with non-native accents. However, the group seemed to agree that focusing on academic English would be more beneficial for computational linguistics and probabilistic grammar applications.\n",
    "The group discussed the value of user and situation models in influencing decisions within the belief net. Grad A suggested separating \"Go-there\" as binary, then considering possibilities of *how* to go there. They wanted user-related aspects to come from the user model and situation-related aspects from the situation model.\n\nGrad E raised concerns about defining discrete values for a running budget, questioning how to represent a continuously changing number. They noted the user's budget can influence decisions. Grad D differentiated \"user finance\" (financial policy) from \"user budget\" (money left to spend).\n\nThe group considered the user budget's influence, recognizing the need for external updates to the belief net and conversions to relevant decision ranges. They debated the frequency of belief propagation after updates, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.\n",
    "The discussions about the Canadian economy's uncertainty during the special period revolved around potential fraud in benefit applications, the struggles of small businesses, the impact on seniors and the agricultural sector, and the overall debt and fiscal position of the government.\n\nCathy McLeod focused on the struggles of small business owners, particularly those ineligible for the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) due to not having a business account or not being on a payroll.\n\nMona Fortier emphasized the government's commitment to supporting Canadians during the crisis, highlighting the importance of health and safety.\n\nMr. Gabriel Ste-Marie raised concerns about tax avoidance by large companies and questioned the fairness of the government's financial support measures. He also expressed skepticism about contracting out the economic recovery plan to the private sector.",
    "The industrial manager, during the team-building exercise, expressed a fondness for cows. They admired the cow's ability to peacefully graze and remain undisturbed, describing them as \"Buddhist in a way.\" They also noted that cows \"do not disturb anybody.\" These characteristics of being undisturbed and peaceful may have been considered worthy of studying for the product design, perhaps implying a desire for a remote control that is simple, unobtrusive, and user-friendly.\n",
    "The team discussed the transcriber interface and transcription tools at length. They are currently using a tool from a French group called \"Transcriber\" which has a Tcl-TK user interface. One member has written a script to convert the output of this tool into a format that can be used by other tools. They also considered using commercial transcription services, but they found them to be too expensive. One team member is working on a way to automatically generate phrase marks and speaker identity. A breakthrough was made in terms of getting the channel-based speech-nonspeech segmentation up and running. Another idea was to wire a speech recognizer up to the interface.\n",
    "The presentations covered several aspects of remote control design and market analysis. The market research indicated that users are willing to pay more for a modern and cool-looking remote, but are frustrated by the number of buttons and the tendency to lose them. Simplicity and ease of use were highly valued.\n\nThe user interface presentation suggested focusing on the image and appearance of the remote, with fewer buttons and a user-centered design. A universal remote was deemed too complex, and the presenter recommended concentrating on TV remotes.\n\nThe industrial designer discussed the internal components, emphasizing the importance of high-quality materials and the potential for rechargeable batteries. The presentation also touched on the technical aspects of signal transmission and circuit board design.\n\nThe marketing presentation focused on competitive analysis and identifying key features that would differentiate the product.

They later suggest that a design without an LCD might be preferable to reduce costs.\n*   **Button Design:** The Project Manager supports a design with raised buttons that are easily identifiable, possibly using symbols for international markets. They also highlight the importance of a prominent on/off button.\n\n",
    "The team had several discussions about recording conventions and incorporating video recordings. They discussed the need for high-quality, close-talking microphones for each speaker to ensure consistent audio quality, especially for dialogue and prosody analysis. They also talked about the possibility of using multiple microphones and experimenting with microphone arrays to capture more spatial information, but acknowledged the increased complexity and data storage requirements.\n\nThe team also discussed the possibility of incorporating video recordings, acknowledging the potential benefits for fusion issues and visual aspects of the meetings. However, they recognized the challenges related to human subjects' concerns, data storage, and the need for additional infrastructure and work. They considered options such as taking snapshots of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting, but ultimately decided to focus on their own interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from the broader research community.",
    "The project finance discussion centered on cost-cutting measures to meet a budget of 12.5 Euros. The team explored options like removing the LCD panel and advanced chip, switching from a double-curved to a single-curved case, and reducing the number of colors on the buttons. They also considered alternative button shapes to enhance the design.\n\nThe \"drawing board\" refers to a digital whiteboard used during the meetings for brainstorming and design evaluation. The marketing expert used it to present a design evaluation based on user requirements and market trends, with criteria like fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, fashion, visibility, and robustness. Team members collectively rated the prototype against these criteria on a scale of one to seven, aiming for a consensus. While the whiteboard was considered potentially useful, the team felt that the PowerPoint presentations were more of a focus. They suggested that using the whiteboard more actively for visual brainstorming and prototyping could enhance the creative process.\n",
    "During the project discussions, the Industrial Designer expressed concern about the materials used and aimed for durability with a rubber coating. They also focused on cost-effectiveness, opting for classic rubber buttons to minimize microchip usage. The Project Manager facilitated the meetings, ensuring everyone was on track and addressing budget concerns.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager concluded that the remote design generally met the initial criteria. However, they noted concerns about the pull-out panel's usability and the disappointment over losing the solar panel feature. Ultimately, the Project Manager acknowledged the need to compromise on certain design elements to meet the budget and marketing goals.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the remote's base, prioritizing fashionability and ease of use. Initially, a ball-shaped design was considered for its stability, but concerns about it rolling led to exploring flattened sides or grips. The industrial designer highlighted the trade-off between stability and design, noting the ubiquity of rectangular remotes but seeking innovation.\n\nMarketing research revealed user dissatisfaction with current remotes' appearance and button overload. The team considered different designs for different target audiences. The user interface designer proposed a sphere that could flip open, while the marketing expert suggested a keyboard-like shape. Ergonomics, one-handed use, and fitting various hand sizes were also discussed.\n\nExisting remotes were criticized for being boring, rectangular, and having too many buttons. The team aimed for a universal remote appealing to a global audience, with a focus on a modern, cool look. Speech recognition and a tracking device were proposed as unique features, but cost and practicality were concerns. The team sought to simplify the remote, reduce unnecessary buttons, and create a user-centered design that addressed the disliked image of current remotes.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of a new remote control's design. Regarding environmentally-friendly material, spongy material, and potential materials, they considered plastic with a rubber casing for grip and comfort, titanium for a high-tech feel, and latex for a spongy feel, but worried about protecting internal components. They also explored the idea of changeable covers with fruit and vegetable colors and shapes.\n\nCurrent trends showed a shift towards fancy, elegant designs with a focus on fruits and vegetables and a spongy texture. The group debated whether to fully embrace this trend, considering the target demographic and potential staleness of the design.\n\nThe LSD screen and color choices involved discussions around a small L_C_D_ screen or an on-screen display for menus, with bright yellow and black (the company colors) being preferred.\n\nThe material and function issue was addressed with a debate on push buttons versus a scroll wheel for the user interface, considering cost and ease of use. They ultimately decided on push buttons for simplicity and cost-effectiveness.\n\nFinally, a questionnaire was mentioned as a way to evaluate the new remote control in terms of user requirements and hot trends, using criteria like fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, and trendy, with a scale of one to seven (true to false).\n",
    "The Project Manager introduced the remote control prototype, emphasizing that it should be television-only, incorporate the company slogan \"We put fashion in electronics,\" and exclude teletext functionality.\n\nThe User Interface representative presented two remote control models. One had many functions but was complicated, while the other was simpler with fewer functions. The group considered multi-functional versus single-functional products, leaning towards simpler functions due to usability testing, which revealed that most users only utilized a small percentage of buttons for basic controls like changing channels and volume.\n\nThe Industrial Designer gave lower grades to metal due to potential interference and safety hazards, suggesting high-grade recycled plastic instead.\n\nThe Marketing Expert brought up the need for a locator due to users frequently losing their remotes. The group discussed voice recognition for the paging system and a simple button for the same.\n",
    "PhD A and PhD C did not have an agreement on the variance. PhD C is doing a manual transcription of the first session and has found 1,000 acoustic events, including about 300 overlapping zones in 45 minutes, and is interested in finding parameters to detect overlapping zones. PhD C plans to compare temporal marks with Jane's transcription to correct errors and get a more accurate transcription. Due to time constraints, a suggestion was made that PhD C only mark speaker overlaps to speed up the process.\n\nJose's work focused on studying parameters to detect overlapping zones in speech recordings.\n\nThe problems and difficulties due to overlaps included the difficulty of determining the speaker due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Also, there is not enough disk space to record all the meetings.",
    "The discussion on latency primarily focused on the Voice Activity Detector (VAD) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The VAD was identified as a significant contributor to latency, adding approximately 40 milliseconds due to its neural net processing nine frames of audio, plus an additional estimated delay from rank ordering. It was stated that the LDA did not add delay.\n\nProfessor B expressed concern about the overall system latency, especially in relation to the standards being developed. There were conflicting reports on the total latency, with one group estimating 130 milliseconds and another at 250 milliseconds. The professor was worried about the neural net and its ability to use both the past and the future. The professor emphasized the importance of improving performance, even if it meant increasing latency to some extent, but also acknowledged the need to consider external latency restrictions.",
    "The User Interface (UI) detailed design of the prototype introduced several features and advantages. One key feature was a joystick-like button that could move in 360 degrees, allowing for various actions like clicking, double-clicking, and swinging. This flexibility aimed to provide powerful functionality with a single button.\n\nAnother feature was modularity, allowing users to add or remove functions like an LCD screen or speech recognition based on their needs and budget. This made the controller cheaper for those who wanted fewer functions.\n\nThe design also included modules for parental control and simplified interfaces for older people with big, clearly labeled buttons. These modules could be added to the remote control. The speech recognition system was also detachable.\n\nOther advantages included the use of robust materials like titanium for durability, a long-lasting battery life with AA batteries, and a misplacement reminder feature that prompted users to return the remote to its charger after use. Additionally, the prototype used programmable channels and vocabulary, allowing users to customize the device.\n",
    "The presentation of the prototype model included discussion of two versions. One version was a curved, handheld design with big, easy push buttons arranged in a way that resembled the company logo. It had an on/off switch and an infrared diode. The designers envisioned it in hard, smooth plastic, similar to an existing remote control, but molded. The second version was banana-shaped, also yellow with black buttons, incorporating the same scroll push-button technology.\n\nThe discussion covered materials, with options including hard smooth plastic or a spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. Color was a key consideration, with a preference for bright yellow with black buttons, aligning with company colors. The organic theme was explored, with the banana shape directly referencing fruit, while the curved version evoked a more general organic, child-friendly feel.\n\nIn conclusion, the team evaluated the prototypes based on criteria such as being fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, and sellable. They considered the aesthetic appeal, simplicity, and potential for cost savings. The team leaned towards a design somewhere between the two prototypes, with a preference for the banana shape. The team decided to move forward with the simple design, and the wooden case concept.\n",
    "The group explored several design elements for the new remote control, keeping budget and functionality in mind.\n\n**Touch Screen/Flip Screens:** The team considered a seven-inch TFT screen but also discussed smaller LCD screens to reduce size and cost. A flip-top design was proposed to protect the screen and potentially house additional buttons. The idea of a pop-up screen, similar to a laptop, was also briefly considered.\n\n**Flip Top Design:** The flip-top design aimed to protect the screen and offer a unique user experience, possibly revealing additional buttons or features. They explored various mechanisms, including a spongy, peelable cover and a magnetic closure, drawing inspiration from banana peels and USB covers. However, the team later leaned towards a non-flipping design for simplicity and durability.\n\n**Battery Issues:** Battery life and charging methods were major concerns. Options discussed included standard AA or AAA batteries, solar cells, and kinetic charging (using motion to generate power). Solar charging was considered innovative but raised questions about effectiveness in low-light conditions. Kinetic charging was also explored, but concerns were raised about its practicality. The team sought a balance between battery life, cost, and convenience.\n\n**Budget Limitations:** The project manager emphasized cost-effectiveness, particularly regarding the voice recognition feature and potential materials. The team prioritized readily available components and manufacturing processes to stay within budget. They explored inexpensive materials like plastic and rubber for the casing and covers, aiming for a balance between aesthetics, functionality, and cost.\n",
    "The Welsh Government is taking several lessons from the three-year investment in Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda. The key themes running through the national mission are drawing from the evaluation, including strong capable school leadership as a driver for change, tracking systems and processes within the school, teacher quality, and collaborative activity. The best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of regional consortia, making that expertise available to all schools.\n\nThe program is progressing with the investment in regional school improvement capacity. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the program is the significant investment in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work. The improvement boards are staying on, and the schools categorization system is used to identify the level of support, with red schools being entitled to 25 days of support, which is more than they would have gotten under the Schools Challenge Cymru program.",
    "Dr. David Blaney believes that Brexit is creating uncertainty for Welsh universities and impacting student applications. He notes an 8% decrease in EU student applications to Welsh institutions, contrasting with a 2% increase in England. He attributes this decline to two main factors: the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to find the full fee, and the Anglocentric nature of the UK media.\n\nDr. Blaney also suggests that the relative levels of investment in facilities and infrastructure between Wales and England impact student choices. He emphasizes that prospective students should choose Wales for its UK-quality education in a safer, more supportive environment. He highlights the \"Study in Wales\" program, a collective effort to market Wales as a good place to study, focusing on its safety and supportive environment.\n",
    "The mental spaces discussed primarily revolve around the tourist domain, with a focus on inferring intentions. The domains in the mental spaces include:\n\n*   **Vista Mode:** The intention to view or look at a landmark or object.\n*   **Enter Mode:** The intention to physically enter a building or location.\n*   **Tango Mode:** The intention to approach or get close to an object or location.\n\nThe middle layer would function as an inferential combination of various features and information to determine the most likely intention (Vista, Enter, or Tango). This layer would take input from sources like linguistic analysis, discourse context, and situational context.\n",
    "The professor expressed interest in the potential of content management systems (CMS) and storing metadata associated with documents. He noted that current systems assume shared interpretations of keywords and taxonomies, which he believes is a key point often overlooked. He is working on building a smart FAQ system that uses context information beyond simple keywords. He acknowledges the challenge of scalability and aims to model the system to combine knowledge from various sources, potentially drawing from semantic web ideas. He is also exploring a probabilistic approach due to the fuzzy nature of document retrieval.\n\nThe professor also brought up concerns about the scalability of Bayesian networks, and he mentioned the need to combine knowledge from different sources.",
    "The meeting transcripts reveal discussions on several critical issues. The seniors care crisis was highlighted, with concerns about neglect, abuse, and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities. There was a call for national standards of care and an end to prioritizing profit over care in these facilities.\n\nThe relationship between racism and government policy was also addressed, focusing on systemic racism against Indigenous and Black Canadians. Discussions included racial profiling, over-policing, over-incarceration, and the need for race-based data collection to address these issues.\n\nAmendments to policies on protecting workers' and pensioners' rights were also raised, particularly regarding the eligibility for emergency benefits and wage subsidies.\n\nHon. Lawrence MacAulay's perspective on the public debate about policies and programs affecting veterans and their families was discussed, including the importance of open discussions and appropriate compensation for veterans.\n\nFinally, the Minister of Seniors' statement on pandemic assistance for seniors included measures such as increasing old age security benefits and the guaranteed income supplement, as well as programs to combat social isolation.",
    "The Project Manager, Marketing, and Industrial Designer experienced disagreements due to their differing priorities and expertise. Marketing focused on customer appeal, aiming for an attractive, impulse-buy product with \"sizzle,\" emphasizing features that would entice customers to purchase the remote, even if not the most technologically advanced. The Industrial Designer concentrated on the technical aspects, including functionality, manufacturing feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. They wanted to incorporate features like fluorescent buttons and child locks but were constrained by budget and technical limitations. The Project Manager was responsible for adhering to higher management's directives, such as limiting the remote's functionality to TVs only and maintaining corporate branding, which sometimes conflicted with Marketing's desire for broader appeal or the Industrial Designer's ideas for innovative features. These conflicting priorities led to disagreements regarding parental control, shape, color, front buttons, wireless control, technical design, and style.",
    "Marketing designed the product evaluation around three key criteria. First, they considered user requirements, assessing whether the product met basic user needs and incorporated desired new technologies. Second, they evaluated trends, focusing on whether the product aligned with current fashion trends and preferences, such as a desire for simple, handy, and fashionable items. Finally, they examined the company strategy, ensuring the product aligned with the company's goals of providing quality, technologically advanced, and environmentally safe products.\n",
    "The SPG schema is being developed to interface between natural language understanding and action planning. It aims to categorize actions (Enter, View, Approach) and provide a rich action description (RAD). The current XML schema includes action schemas, Source-Path-Goal schemas, and linkages between them. The team is working towards a better formal and semantic understanding of constructions, with potential for enhancements using X-path specifications and constraints via X-forms. There is a discussion of whether to keep the current hierarchical structure or to simplify it by directly listing relevant schemas under each action. Examples of data and XML schemas are planned for future meetings to improve clarity.",
    "In the meeting transcript, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness by stating that Amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law. She mentioned that this was in response to the committee's recommendation. Regarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister stated that the amendments were to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and she believed there was also a committee recommendation to this end. On regulation-making powers, the Deputy Minister's Amendment 3 sought to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1. She said she did not think it was necessary to have wider powers, but assured the committee that she would keep that in review coming up to Stage 3.",
    "The transcripts reveal a multi-faceted discussion concerning long-term trends in education in Wales. The discussion highlights the challenges in comparing data due to changing performance measures, though the changes are intended to benefit learners. Minister Williams emphasizes a shift towards a broader range of data for a holistic view of education performance, going beyond simple indicators.\n\nPhilip Blaker of Qualifications Wales describes their role as regulating awarding bodies, focusing on qualification design and assessment delivery. He highlights the need for sufficient time for reforms to allow for system readiness and suggests reviewing timelines for the new curriculum.\n\nRegarding timescales for addressing the lack of resources, Gareth Pierce of WJEC attributes delays to three series of reforms and short timelines between qualification approval and publisher work. He suggests a need for 18 months to two years from specification completion to resource availability. Blaker adds that diverging GCSEs and A-levels between England and Wales will allow Wales more agency in establishing timelines. He suggests a \"go/no-go\" decision in 2023 regarding the new curriculum's implementation.",
    "The discussion highlighted challenges in implementing good practice across Wales due to inconsistencies in early childhood education and care provision. The Welsh Government acknowledged the complexity of the existing system and the need for simplification. A key challenge is the variance in the amount of early education provided by different local authorities, influenced by historical decisions and funding models.\n\nThe implications for childcare services are significant. The Welsh Government is exploring ways to address these inconsistencies, including pathfinder projects in eight local authorities aimed at creating a more joined-up and responsive system. These projects focus on improving accessibility and efficacy of services, with a child-centered approach that also supports parents. The goal is to ensure that all children in Wales have the best start in life, regardless of their location.\n",
    "The team discussed the availability and choice of components for the remote control. The case material was initially considered to be plastic, titanium, rubber, or wood, but titanium and rubber were ruled out due to manufacturing limitations and heat concerns, respectively. Plastic was also eliminated as a case material due to its brittle nature, leaving wood as the preferred option. The team discussed the potential for exotic woods and customizable designs.\n\nFor the interface design, the team considered pushbuttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. Pushbuttons were favored for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The use of an advanced chip-on-print was recommended to support features like infrared sender, sensor and speaker integration, and speech recognition.\n",
    "The professor believes the final model adamantly insisted on going in with a brain-damaged system, doing nothing explicitly to handle additive noise, and that the RASTA-like filtering was tending to handle convolutional noise. The professor thinks that spectral subtraction schemes seem to do a nice job. They discuss reverberation, with a desire to deal with time-varying reverberation responses, and the professor references Avendano's work as an approach. The professor notes that Adam ran out of digits and didn't have time to regenerate any, leading to a discussion about whether to pronounce the digit zero as \"zero\" or \"oh.\" The professor notes that in digit recognition, they have two pronunciations for that value.",
    "The group discussed the introduction of a new remote control project with specific design constraints. The remote is to be television-only, excluding DVD or other device controls, and must embody the slogan \"We put fashion in electronics.\"\n\nConcept decisions centered on using plastic instead of metal for the casing to avoid potential interference and lawsuits, with exploration of high-grade recycled plastics for aesthetic value. Simpler functions were favored, with voice control considered for basic commands like volume up, catering to a younger demographic. The idea of a universal remote was discarded as the remote will only control the television.\n\nParental control and games were not discussed.\n\nVoice recognition was explored for basic controls, with the possibility of using it in conjunction with a paging system to locate the remote. Touch screens were discussed with the possibility of having submenus for extra controls, with the basic channel and power controls on the main screen. The team also discussed the need for a new battery technology, and putting the company logo on the boot-up screen.\n",
    "The group discussed the evaluations of increasing suicide crimes during COVID-19 and the long-term special care for pregnant women. Vaughan Gething expressed general concern about mental health and the potential impact of restrictions on children and young people. He mentioned that the government commissioned a review, through the delivery unit working with the national advisory group, to investigate unexpected deaths during the pandemic, including potential links to increased suicide rates. The report was expected by the end of the month, and Gething offered to share it with the committee.\n\nRegarding perinatal mental health, Gething emphasized the government's commitment to consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales, especially during the pandemic. He highlighted the use of phone and online services and acknowledged the challenges in providing in-patient capacity due to the pandemic. Gething mentioned awareness of a decrease in women seeking mother and baby unit provision, potentially due to fear and lockdown measures, and assured that this wouldn't influence planning for the facility's need.\n",
    "The implementation work is scheduled to be completed in January 2020, with a final version of the curriculum expected at that time. Quality improvement practitioners will be completing their work by November, and refinements will be handed over to an editorial process.\n\nRegarding the risk of losing focus, there is an acknowledgement that the curriculum alone won't hugely enhance equity. Strong leadership in schools, high expectations for all children, and a curriculum that meets their needs are essential. The four enabling purposes of the curriculum are also critical for success.\n\nRegarding improvements that present more of a challenge, Kirsty Williams AM stated that opportunities to do things better, explain things better, and simplify where possible are welcome. They are willing to engage in those improvements.\n\nNetworking within the PRU was not mentioned in the meeting transcript. Arrangements for the transition were discussed in the meeting. Transition arrangements for children and young people were a concern, particularly from children into adult services. A transition guidance was published a couple of years ago and is being evaluated.\n",
    "During the general requirements discussion, the group did not mention infra-red functionality directly, but did discuss the transmission between the remote control and the TV and the option of using the traditional technologies of infra-red.\n\nThe group had a lengthy discussion on disposable income, especially in relation to the target audience. The team decided to aim for the fifteen to thirty-five age bracket, as this demographic generally has some expendable income to spend on this sort of thing. They also considered that this age group is typically more gadget-oriented and comfortable with technology, making them more likely to purchase an advanced remote control. The team discussed balancing the desire for advanced features with the product's overall cost and target market, especially since they had a limited budget.\n",
    "The group generally agrees that eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is the best available measure for identifying pupils to target with the Pupil Development Grant (PDG), though they acknowledge it may not be perfect. There is an overall concern that relying solely on FSM eligibility may not capture all disadvantaged pupils or address the needs of more able and talented students from low-income backgrounds.\n\nRegarding the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, there is evidence of improvements in attendance. Some schools use PDG funds for initiatives like \"walking buses\" and employing staff to work directly with families. However, a significant gap persists between the attendance of FSM pupils and non-FSM pupils, and the group recognizes that more needs to be done to address this issue.\n",
    "The professor's thoughts on support vector machines (SVMs) were in the context of comparing them to recurrent neural nets for speech recognition. He noted that SVMs are \"succinct\" and can perform reasonably well with less data. He likened the SVM approach to condensed nearest-neighbor methods, where only critical examples are kept to represent and classify data, contrasting it with the brute-force nature of neural nets and Gaussian mixtures. He mentioned that neural nets require many parameters and can struggle with limited data.\n\nRegarding speech rate algorithms, the professor did not discuss speech rate algorithms specifically. However, he was interested in the multi-band approach and using narrow-band information for phonetic features instead of immediately going for the typical sound units.\n",
    "The professor thinks acoustic events should be studied but is unsure how. They feel that non-speech acoustic events like breaths, aspirations, claps and silence should be studied to find good parameters to detect overlapping speech. The professor suggests that speech and overlapping speech should be classified using clustering algorithms or neural net algorithms to study the properties of different features. The professor wants to find a control set that includes silence without noise. They think it would be interesting to have two microphones to study binaural sound and they want to find out what can be done with one microphone on a PDA.\n",
    "The team extensively discussed the user interface design of the remote control, focusing on simplicity and user-friendliness. They decided to prioritize a TV remote due to time constraints. Key considerations included minimizing the number of buttons, as users primarily use channel and volume controls. The team explored incorporating a \"previous channel\" button for easy zapping, along with clearly marked channel and volume buttons. They also considered a wheel or ball design for incremental channel changes.\n\nAdditional features discussed were a backlight for easy finding in the dark and the inclusion of the company's logo and colors. The team ultimately decided against an LCD screen and speech recognition due to development time and cost. The final design aimed for a balance between simplicity, functionality, and brand identity, with a focus on addressing user frustrations related to complexity and ease of use.\n",
    "During the product evaluation and discussion of product requirements, the project manager had a few key thoughts on the plastic material, changeable cover, color, and shape of the model.\n\nRegarding the material, the project manager initially envisioned hard, smooth plastic for the remote control, similar to existing remotes. However, they also acknowledged the potential benefits of a spongy rubber cover, especially for reinforcing the product. They also expressed concern about the durability of the design without reinforcement if it was made of something other than hard plastic.\n\nConcerning the changeable covers, the project manager seemed open to the idea as a separate product that could be suggested to management.\n\nAs for the color, the project manager supported the idea of bright yellow with black buttons, as these are the company colors.\n\nIn terms of shape, the project manager liked the \"chunk\" shape somewhere between the original two prototypes. They also thought the banana shape was the obvious choice to promote fruit and vegetables.\n",
    "The discussion centered on fixing the speech recognition system and improving the baseline performance. One key area was addressing bugs that caused feature behavior to vary unexpectedly. The team explored spectral subtraction and cepstral mean subtraction-like techniques, similar to those used by French Telecom and Alcatel, and the potential for combining these with their existing methods.\n\nA significant focus was on voice activity detection (VAD) and its impact on performance, particularly in noisy conditions. The team also investigated methods for noise reduction, including Wiener filtering, spectral subtraction, and smoothing techniques to reduce musical noise. The team also discussed online normalization and its effect on performance. Experiments involving multi-band processing, subspace methods, and vocal tract scaling were also ongoing.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts detail several discussions regarding financial assistance and economic recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Legislation:** There was discussion on firearms legislation and regulation, Bill C-7, Senate Bill S-204, and the Statistics Act.\n\n**Sports Infrastructural Construction:** No mention.\n\n**Government Support for Energy Resources and Tourism:** The government is providing liquidity measures for large corporations in the oil and gas sector and working with provinces to ensure stability. There is concern about the lack of a specific tourism aid package, with businesses facing potential closures.\n\n**Funding in Green Economy and Small Businesses:** Discussions include the transition to a green economy, but there are concerns about funding for pipeline projects.

There was also concern on the effect on lobster fishermen.\n",
    "The team discussed the design and functionality of the remote control, initially considering a ball shape for its stability. However, they acknowledged the rolling issue and the need for a flat side. The idea of a hinged, flip-phone style design was proposed but raised concerns about the hinge's durability and the remote constantly being left open.\n\nThe team agreed that simplicity was key, aiming for fewer buttons and a user-centered design. They considered personalization through different designs for target audiences and removable covers, possibly with fruit or vegetable themes.\n\nA novel shape was discussed, with the team trending towards a rounded design that fits in the hand, potentially with grips. The final decision on the casing shape leaned towards a plastic shell with strategically placed rubber grips, allowing for a scroll wheel and an LCD screen. The fruit aspect was deemed less important for the overall shape but could be incorporated subtly through colors or a fruit-shaped holder.\n",
    "The marketing team proposed different colors, specifically lemon or lime, for the product because market trend analysis indicated a growing preference for items that evoke natural elements, particularly fruits and vegetables. This trend extends beyond color to include shape and texture, with consumers favoring rounder, more organic forms and spongy materials. The marketing team believed that associating the product with these elements would make it more appealing and fashionable, aligning with current consumer preferences for fancy, visually pleasing designs over purely functional ones. This strategy was intended to capture the attention of a younger demographic (25-35 year olds) who value trendy and unique products.\n",
    "The overall conclusion is that the new remote control project should target the elderly market (46-65 years old) due to its significant market share. The design should prioritize simplicity and functionality over advanced technology to minimize repetitive strain injury and ease of use. They also determined that a quarter of people found remote controls caused repetitive strain injuries, and 34% found it hard to learn how to operate a new remote control. The remote should have very few buttons. The inclusion of teletext is deemed necessary, potentially with a feature for larger subtitles. The possibility of a docking station for charging is considered, but a small screen to explain button functions is preferred over a touchscreen. The team needs to research what elderly people want. They will choose between a docking station and a screen. The remote should also include a beeping function to help locate it.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts provided, here is a summary of the key topics discussed:\n\n**Future of Institutions:** Members discussed the need to reimagine and rework institutions, including the police, to address systemic racism.

    "The discussion on the meeting recordings focused on the digits spoken in the meetings. Dave was going to start working with the digits and there was at least one user for the digits once they get done. Scripts were available that the transcribers would use to help with the transcription of the digits. These scripts would efficiently extract sections of each utterance. The group also discussed whether to record digits at meetings outside of the current group. They also discussed using the digit recordings for adaptation. Block echo cancellation was also suggested.",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the recommendation for a speech recognition interface stems from marketing research indicating a strong interest among the 15-35 age group, with 75-90% willing to pay extra for this feature. The perceived benefits vary across departments:\n\n*   **Marketing:** Sees speech recognition as a trendy, marketable gimmick to attract younger demographics and potentially command a higher price. It could be a unique selling proposition, making the remote stand out.\n*   **Industrial Designer:** Believes speech recognition is feasible if the user is willing to invest time in training the device.\n*   **User Interface Designer:** Acknowledges its potential as a great feature but emphasizes the need for robust technology to filter out ambient noise and television audio to prevent unintended commands. The UI designer is also concerned about the limited vocabulary.\n",
    "The discussion included comments on racism and the death of George Floyd. The aim of the group is to address issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Yves-Francois Blanchet suggested prioritizing refugee claims, especially Haitian and Black individuals. Several members spoke out against racism and discrimination.\n\nThe meeting transcripts do not contain discussions on work of consortia, attitudes, opinions, or the role of regional consortia and Cabinet Secretary, nor do they include statements by Jassa Scott about the work of regional consortia and the comments on the Auditor General.\n\nBill Blair responded to the firearms seizure issue at Pearson airport by emphasizing the importance of preventing guns from getting into the hands of criminals and strengthening gun control. The transcripts do not include information on measures proposed for ensuring social stability.\n",
    "The team discussed several functions for the remote control. Initially, the focus was on standard functions like changing channels, volume control, and on/off capabilities. The team also explored the inclusion of less frequently used functions like audio and screen settings, accessible through a menu button.\n\nA key improvement discussed was a \"lost-and-found\" function. The team considered a homing device, similar to cordless phones, where a button on a base station (potentially attached to the TV) would make the remote beep, aiding in its location. This idea was favored over speech recognition due to budget constraints and potential usability issues.\n\nBrainstorming led to the concept of a simplified remote with fewer buttons, focusing on the most frequently used functions. A touch-based circular pad, inspired by the iPod, was suggested for channel and volume control. The team also explored design elements like larger buttons and ergonomic shapes for user-friendliness.\n",
    "During the finance discussion, the Industrial Designer separated the volume and channel buttons by color, using orange for volume buttons. Marketing had assumed that only the red apple button would be a different color and expressed concern about the cost implications of adding more colors. The User Interface representative stated that the colors wouldn't be \"too important\".\n\nMarketing was dissatisfied with the changes because they felt the design was becoming cheap and did not fit with the company's other high-tech products. They preferred the original concept with a rubber case and were disappointed that cost-cutting measures led to a plastic case and changes to the button design. Marketing suggested alternative button shapes and layouts to maintain a sense of style and fanciness, but ultimately felt the final design was a compromise that didn't fully align with their vision.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, here are the key points discussed regarding the implementation of the Welsh dimension, employers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac), and the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales:\n\n*   **Implementation of the Welsh Dimension:** There was no discussion of the Welsh Dimension in the selected transcripts.\n\n*   **Employers' Understanding of the Welsh Bac:** There is a consensus among the panel that employers lack a clear understanding of the Welsh Bac and its value. Many employers are primarily focused on core qualifications and skills relevant to their specific industries. Some feel the Welsh Bac has lost its initial vision and become too bureaucratic. There was discussion of engaging employers more directly in the review and delivery of the Welsh Bac to increase its relevance and employer buy-in.\n\n*   **Benefits of an Independent Body for Inspecting in Wales:** There was no discussion of the benefits of having an independent body for inspecting in Wales in the selected transcripts.",
    "The group discussed the convenience of presentation materials during their meeting, focusing on ways to improve data collection for user interface design. One suggestion was the use of CrossPads to capture handwritten notes and summaries, but concerns were raised about handwriting recognition quality. They considered using notes taken by designated note-takers in meetings, but recognized this might not fully address query generation.\n\nThe group explored the idea of recording summaries instead of writing them to save time and capture more information. They also discussed the potential value of collecting digital pictures of the meeting space, including the table and boards, to provide context. Overall, the group seemed to agree that the more information they could gather, the better, but they also recognized the need to balance data collection with the convenience of the participants.\n",
    "The team decided against using LCD displays primarily due to cost considerations and usability concerns. The industrial designer stated that LCD screens require a more advanced and expensive chip. Additionally, there were concerns about the practical value of an LCD on a universal remote, as it wouldn't receive information back from the television, limiting its functionality. Some team members also felt that looking down at a small LCD screen and then back up at the TV would be cumbersome. Ultimately, the team favored exploring alternative interface options like push buttons and scroll wheels.\n",
    "**Self-Introduction:** The initial meeting transcript lacks explicit self-introductions but includes roles such as Project Manager, Industrial Designer, User Interface, and Marketing. In the second meeting, participants identify themselves with names and channels, e.g., \"I'm Morgan, and where am I? I'm on channel three,\" and there is discussion about pseudo-names.\n\n**Project Introduction:** The project focuses on developing a remote with voice recognition, considering limitations, risks, and design approaches. The initial design includes simple features for television operation with a slide or fold-out bay for advanced functions.

    "The team discussed several options for powering the remote, including standard batteries (double A and triple A), dynamo charging (wind-up), solar charging, and kinetic charging. \n\nThe Industrial Designer stated that there was not a rechargeable option available. They felt dynamo charging was \"a bit silly\". Solar charging was considered as most people have lights on in the room anyway. Kinetic charging, similar to that used in wrist watches, was also discussed. The team considered the practicality and effectiveness of each option, with concerns raised about the size of standard batteries, the inconvenience of dynamo charging, the need for sunlight for solar charging, and whether kinetic charging would generate enough power given the remote's usage patterns.\n\nUltimately, they decided to explore kinetic charging further, considering its potential for originality and convenience, but also acknowledged the need for market research and cost analysis before making a final decision.\n",
    "The decision regarding microphone procedures was to send the speech and non-speech detected files to IBM without editing. The team will sample the files to ensure quality. The team will provide IBM with conventions on how to mark the files, specifically to be conservative with transcriptions. The team will also double-check with Brian on the conventions. The team can adjust the files when they come back. The team also discussed whether to include the laptop audio in the files to send to IBM and decided to send it. The team also decided to do speech transcriptions.",
    "During the meetings, Kirsty Williams AM stated that schools would move to a new phase when it was safe to do so, based on advice from medical officers.

A final decision on the remote's features and design is expected.\n\nRegarding repetitive strain injury (RSI), there is no discussion of it in the meeting transcripts.\n\nThe group reflects on previous meetings, noting that the brainstorming sessions were more productive than the actual meetings. They also discuss the limitations of the provided tools and the structure of the teamwork, suggesting that more open communication outside of formal meetings would be beneficial. The team evaluates the design based on initial goals and market research, identifying areas for improvement and cost reduction.\n",
    "The lab tests revealed a desire for a fancy look and feel rather than a functional one. The team discussed the possibility of a finder button and agreed that it would need a mid-class chip. They considered voice activation for the finder but were concerned about unwanted activation and decided against it. The team decided to use pushbuttons.\n\nThe team explored various button design details and location options. They considered a scroll wheel for channel control, ultimately deciding to combine it with pushbuttons. They discussed button placement for both right- and left-handed users. The team settled on a banana shape with buttons on the side.\n\nRegarding lighting adaptive options, the team agreed to include a lighting feature to make the remote easy to find in the dark. They initially considered a continuous light but were concerned about battery consumption. They decided the buttons would illuminate when touched.\n",
    "The team discussed DAT (likely referring to data collection), power cables, and capturing subject intention in the context of meeting recordings. \n\nRegarding data collection, the team explored various methods to gather information useful for user interface design, including the use of CrossPads for note-taking, summaries, and identifying key words. They considered the trade-offs between comprehensive data capture and the burden on participants, as well as the potential for bias in summaries and queries. The team also touched upon the practicalities of recording equipment, microphone placement, and spatial positioning of participants. \n\nFor power, the team considered different power sources, including solar cells, batteries, wind-up cranks, and kinetic energy. They discussed the pros and cons of each option, taking into account factors such as cost, reliability, and environmental impact.\n\nTo capture subject intention, the team explored methods such as asking participants to summarize meetings, identify the most interesting thing they learned, and generate queries. They also discussed the potential for automatically generating queries from summaries and the challenges of capturing the nuances of human intention and motivation.\n\nThe team considered different approaches for analyzing the collected data, including word frequency counts, information retrieval techniques, and identifying key words and action items.\n",
    "The group discussed the general specification and case design, focusing on fashion trends and user interface. The industrial designer suggested a simple chip with push buttons to keep costs down, while the user interface designer proposed a menu system with an on-screen display. The marketing representative emphasized the importance of a fancy look and feel, citing trends of fruits and vegetables and spongy materials.\n\nThe team decided to incorporate these trends by designing a banana-shaped remote control with a spongy cover. The wheel sensor, though expensive, was kept for its innovative appeal. The buttons would be placed on the side, accommodating both right- and left-handed users. The buttons would be lighted to easily identify the correct side.\n\nThe discussion led to the decision to have a spongy, banana-shaped case with buttons on the side and a wheel on top. This design aimed to balance the need for a fancy look and feel with ease of use and cost-effectiveness, while also incorporating current fashion trends.\n",
    "Councillor Huw David's views were expressed during the meeting when he welcomed full involvement in the implementation of the Bill, emphasizing the importance of a major awareness-raising campaign to take families, carers, and parents along on the journey. He stressed the need for support for parents who struggle with parenting, offered universally across Wales.\n\nRegarding the unintended consequences of the Bill, Huw David hoped there would be none if the implementation was careful and resourced adequately. He acknowledged that implementation and cultural change are key, stressing the importance of resources for social services departments that are already overstretched and dealing with serious harm and neglect cases. Huw David stated that the rise in neglect is due to multifactorial reasons, including austerity, awareness of adverse childhood experiences, and changes in practice.\n\nOn the need for legislation given changing natural behavior and culture, Huw David stated that such legislation reflects a cultural change in Wales over the last 30-40 years, where most parents say they do not use or support physical punishment. He believes it protects children's rights and is a natural progression of societal changes.\n\nHuw David did not specifically address whether it should be explicitly stated in the Bill.\n",
    "The group discussed the design and functionality of a two-sided remote control, including its evaluation, market range, and technical requirements.\n\nThe Industrial Designer suggested plastic over metal due to interference and lawsuit concerns, proposing recycled plastic for aesthetic value. They also mentioned a 200-foot range for the remote. The User Interface Developer emphasized a simpler interface over complicated ones. The Marketing Expert's research indicated that users primarily use basic functions like channel and volume, and often lose remotes. Younger demographics were interested in voice recognition, which the group explored.\n\nThe group considered modern polymers, voice operation, and a paging system. A touch screen with submenus was proposed, balancing simple functions with high-tech options. Concerns about cost and battery life with a touch screen were raised. They provisionally decided on a plastic-cased touch screen remote with a focus on a young demographic, incorporating voice recognition.\n\nWater-proof and shock-proof capabilities were not directly discussed in the meeting transcript.\n",
    "The discussions on the amendments in group 3 centered on the regulation-making powers granted to Welsh Ministers in connection with section 1 of the Bill. The Deputy Minister sought to add existing power back onto the face of the Bill and argued the amendments were technical and did not require an Assembly procedure.\n\nSuzy Davies, however, raised concerns about the scope of these powers, suggesting that the \"transitory, transitional and saving provisions\" might not be sufficient for implementing aspects of the awareness campaign and report. She introduced amendment 3A as a \"probing amendment\" and a \"holding position,\" exploring whether the Minister should consider amending the Bill to grant more unrestricted power to make regulations for implementing section 1. Davies emphasized the importance of ensuring the Assembly has an opportunity to scrutinize any measures introduced under section 1.\n\nThe Deputy Minister responded that she did not believe wider powers were necessary but would keep the issue under review and discuss it further before Stage 3. She confirmed her willingness to discuss this with the committee before Stage 3. Ultimately, Davies moved amendment 3A, but it was met with objection, leading to a vote.\n",
    "Brexit's impact on higher education in Wales involves potential fee increases for EU students, aligning them with international student fees, though reciprocal agreements could curtail this.

    "The key points regarding the role of the middle tier and government support for the elderly and vulnerable people in Canada are:\n\n*   **Disproportionate Impact:** COVID-19 has disproportionately affected seniors, particularly those in long-term care homes, with a high percentage of deaths occurring in these facilities.\n*   **Jurisdictional Issues:** The federal government acknowledges the provinces' primary jurisdiction over long-term care but expresses willingness to support them.\n*   **Call for National Standards:** There are calls for national standards of care in long-term care facilities, potentially governed by principles similar to the Canada Health Act.\n*   **Profit vs. Care:** Concerns are raised about prioritizing profit over adequate care in for-profit long-term care homes.\n*   **Government Financial Support:** The government has provided financial support to seniors through measures like the GST credit supplement and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).\n*   **Long-Term Care Home Conditions:** Appalling conditions in some long-term care homes have been reported, including neglect, abuse, and safety violations. The Canadian Armed Forces were sent in to provide support and report on the conditions.\n*   **Investigation:** The Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the reports, including alerting the province's chief coroner.\n\n",
    "The marketing expert believes the remote control should be visually appealing and easy to use. They emphasize the importance of a sleek design to attract consumers, stating that people must first \"like\" the product's appearance. The expert suggests researching competitor designs and ideas to create something new and appealing. They acknowledge that a simpler design is preferred. They also note that the target demographic should be fifteen to thirty five year olds, since those older than thirty five were not very interested in voice recognition. Ultimately, the marketing expert believes that if the remote is fashionable and simple, it will be successful.\n",
    "The main points discussed regarding the Act were its universal adoption, advantages, and weaknesses. Witnesses expressed differing views on the effectiveness of the Act in achieving its four strategic aims: regulating institutions, safeguarding public contributions, maintaining fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy. Some believed the Act has not been strong enough, requiring the annual remit letter to drive objectives. Others suggested the Act's focus on individual institutions did not encourage collaboration.\n\nWhile most agreed on the importance of fee and access plans, concerns were raised about their bureaucratic nature and focus on inputs rather than outcomes. There were also discussions about HEFCW's powers of intervention, which some found inflexible and difficult to use for swift interventions. The witnesses also mentioned concerns about governance within universities and the need for greater diversity on governing bodies.\n",
    "The group presented three different remote control prototypes: the rhombus, the potato, and the Martian. They discussed the form, button layout, number of buttons, colors, and branding for each prototype.\n\nMarketing provided a product evaluation using a criteria based on design goals and market research. The criteria included uniqueness, functionality, technology, ease of use, spongy quality, integration of fruits and vegetables, design matching appropriate behavior, prevention of RSI, ease of losing, and simplicity and fashion. Each participant ranked each criterion on a scale of one to seven, with one being extremely true and seven being not true at all.\n\nThe group also discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the room, leadership, teamwork, and the tools used during the project. They concluded that they achieved most of the design goals but could have done even better with more information.",
    "The participants did not discuss CDs for backup. One participant suggested using CDs for archiving data, but they were quickly dismissed due to their short lifespan and unreliability. The participants agreed that tape backups were a better archiving solution.\n\nThe participants discussed the probability computation in the context of a belief net for inferring user intentions in a navigation system. The goal was to distinguish between three intentions: \"Vista\" (viewing), \"Enter\" (entering), and \"Tango\" (approaching). They discussed using factors like object type, time of day, and linguistic features to compute the probability of each intention.\n\nThe experimental setup of the computer navigation system involved a user sitting in a room with a 3D model or animation of a location (Heidelberg). They were told that the computer system could answer any questions. After a few tasks, the system would \"crash,\" and a human operator would take over, unbeknownst to the user. The goal was to collect data on how people phrase requests to the system and to see if the system could accurately infer their intentions.\n",
    "The group decided against positioning symmetrical buttons on both sides of the remote due to concerns about usability. While it could offer options for left- and right-handed users, it was believed it would complicate the ease of use.\n\nRegarding the Project Manager's suggestion of creating separate right- and left-handed remotes, the team seemed to dismiss this idea. It was mentioned that the functions of a remote are basic enough that handedness shouldn't pose a significant problem. There was a general agreement that a standard shape would suffice, implying that catering specifically to left-handed users with a separate remote wasn't deemed necessary or cost-effective.\n",
    "The group discussed several aspects of cost reduction and feature abandonment. Initially, the estimated production cost was \u20ac15.80, which was later reduced to \u20ac15.40 by using a single-curved design. The team also considered abandoning a trigger button feature due to uncertainty about its utility and potential for accidental power button presses.\n\nTo meet the budget of \u20ac12.50, the team explored various cost-saving measures, including switching to a plastic casing and a solid unit design. They also contemplated ditching the LCD, which accounted for a significant portion of the expenditure, but decided against it as it was considered a key feature. The locator beacon was also considered for removal. The team explored cheaper materials and manufacturing processes to lower costs. The final prototype was designed to be within budget by sacrificing material quality and case design while retaining the LCD.\n",
    "The meeting transcripts discuss the pros and cons of voice recognition.\n\nPros:\n*   Voice recognition has improved, achieving reasonable results on meeting data using Switchboard-trained recognizers.\n*   With even a small amount of meeting transcription data added to the language model, performance can improve significantly.\n*   Forced alignments, which are beneficial for extracting prosodic information and speaker overlaps, are likely to be good due to the quality of word recognition.\n*   Gender recognition is accurate.\n\nCons:\n*   The language model for Switchboard is totally different, leading to errors with specific terms not in the Switchboard vocabulary.\n*   Lapel microphones can negatively impact recognition accuracy, especially compared to headset microphones.\n*   Acoustic glitches and synchronization problems between channels can cause significant errors.\n*   Errors occur with plural \"s\" and verb inflections.\n*   The language model for Switchboard is totally different, leading to errors with specific terms not in the Switchboard vocabulary.\n*   There are inconsistencies in transcription, such as digit representation (e.g., \"one one\" vs. \"eleven\") and acronym capitalization.",
    "The discussion on battery options included considerations of double A, triple A, lithium, solar charging, dynamo charging, and kinetic charging. The Industrial Designer (ID) felt standard batteries were bulky and dynamo charging was \"silly.\" The ID noted solar charging could work since people often watch TV with lights on. Kinetic charging, like in wristwatches, seemed promising due to constant movement, but its effectiveness was questioned.\n\nThe ID stated that there's no rechargeable option available, and the standard double A and triple A batteries were too bulky.\n\nRegarding conservation, the ID suggested a standby mode to turn off button lights when not in use. \n\nThe ID felt that solar charging would detract from the attractiveness of the design.\n\nThe final decision was to go with batteries instead of solar power, and the group decided on triple A batteries because they would be lighter.\n\nThe Industrial Designer did not recommend a charger. Instead, they recommended a lithium battery because lithium batteries are widely available in other electronic products.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcript, the primary reason for including the project in a conference paper was to disseminate findings related to overlap in conversations and its impact on speech recognition. The paper focused on analyzing the amount of overlap in different corpora, including Meeting Recorder meetings, and comparing it to Switchboard, CallHome, and Robustness meetings. Additionally, the paper explored how overlaps affect recognition performance and examined the distribution of discourse markers and pauses in relation to interruption points. The goal was to present novel corpora data and analysis related to speech recognition to the Eurospeech conference.",
    "Kirsty Williams did not express thoughts on funding allocated to consortia in the provided transcripts. Regarding university governance, Williams acknowledged concerns raised by the University and College Union, stating that the HE Act does not directly address governance issues. She highlighted her efforts to engage directly with university chairs and supported the independent review of governance undertaken collaboratively by Universities Wales and HEFCW. She stated that the new commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. Williams did not express a burning desire or set policy to pursue mergers, but she was in favor of a healthy, strong, and sustainable HE sector.\n\nRegarding admission problems, Williams acknowledged a drop in EU student applications in Wales, attributing it to changes in government policy regarding student support and the change in the tuition fee grant. She emphasized the importance of universities getting their offer right and providing high-quality teaching and infrastructure to attract students. She mentioned the Global Wales programme as a means to boost international marketing of the HE sector.\n",
    "The team discussed several aspects of the remote's design. For the energy source, they decided on a lithium battery due to its longer lifespan and suitability for a technologically advanced product. Regarding technological innovation, the remote includes voice recognition, a kinetic battery, and a latex case, but the team noted it wasn't extremely innovative beyond these features.\n\nOverall, the team evaluated the remote based on criteria such as ease of use, fashionability, functionality, and whether it integrated fruits and vegetables (inspired by the \"potato\" prototype). The \"potato\" design was favored for its ergonomic shape and distinctive appearance. They also considered preventing repetitive strain injuries with the latex grip. While they acknowledged a steeper learning curve due to the menu system, they believed the remote would be easy to use once mastered. The team aimed for a balance between simplicity and fashion, incorporating the corporate logo and colors into the design. However, they did express some disappointment in not addressing the issue of losing the remote. Ultimately, they aimed to create a trendy and functional product with international appeal.\n",
    "Technical Issues: The group discussed technical functional designs and specifications of user interface. They also talked about battery types for the remote control, considering lithium batteries for longer life.\n\nEnergy Source: Lithium batteries were suggested as a longer-lasting alternative to double-A batteries, similar to those used in MP3 players.\n\nProject Announcement Email: The project manager confirmed that everyone received the project notices on their computers and emphasized the importance of checking the company website and emails for updates.\n\nSample Sensor: The discussion touched on incorporating a sensor into the remote control that would emit a signal (beep or light) when the remote is hidden or in a dark place, making it easier to find. They considered light sensors but dismissed voice or clapping activation as not specific enough.",
    "The last meeting covered several key topics and problems. The discussion began with the status of transcription efforts, both those outsourced to IBM and those being done internally at ICSI. Concerns were raised about transcribers sitting idle due to delays in receiving data back from IBM, and the possibility of utilizing them for other transcription tasks.\n\nA significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to participant approval and the process of sending out transcripts to participants for review and editing. This included discussions on providing access to both transcripts and audio, and the practical challenges of dealing with large uncompressed audio files. The group also discussed disk space issues, with a looming shortage due to the need to keep multiple versions of meeting data for transcription and other processing tasks. Potential solutions were explored, including utilizing the new SPARC-Blade SUN-Blades and hanging additional scratch disks.\n\nThe meeting also touched on progress in automatic speech recognition, including the combination of PLP and Mel Cepstra front-end systems, and the potential benefits of incorporating read speech data from other databases into training sets. Finally, the group discussed the tandem system and the upcoming annual report.\n",
    "Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies raised several concerns regarding the childcare offer. They questioned the \u00a34.50 single national rate, fearing it might create a two-tiered system where wealthier parents could afford better care through add-ons. They worried about affordability for the lowest-income working families, who would be most affected by additional charges for items like transport and food.\n\nConcerns were raised about piloting the scheme in Cardiff and Newport due to the higher costs of providing childcare in those areas and whether the \u00a34.50 rate would be sustainable. David also questioned the capacity growth in the foundational sector and the qualification and quality of the workforce to deliver the childcare offer, especially considering the aim to maintain the \u00a34.50 rate.\n",
    "The discussion on on-line and phase normalization included PhD C describing work on on-line normalization, including different means for silence and speech and a variable time constant. Professor B suggested examining the kinds of errors made. PhD F mentioned phase normalization and getting garbage results and talked about using complex arithmetic. Grad G spoke about phase normalization and modulo two pi and getting worse results unwrapping, and scaling numbers.\n\nProfessor B stated that they were adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system.\n\nIt is not possible to summarize the opinion of PhD C and the professor on phase normalization and quals. PhD C did not talk about quals. The professor stated that, \"I really would like to suggest looking , a little bit at the kinds of errors. I know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but sometimes.\"",
    "The discussion centered on several aspects of detecting important linguistic features. First, the group discussed using a second stream of purely spectral data to supplement the primary feature stream. Initial attempts hurt performance, suggesting a need for careful integration.\n\nThe conversation touched on using a hierarchical structure for silence probability estimation, leveraging the VAD network instead of the tandem network. This approach was found to improve performance, potentially due to the smaller size of the VAD network acting as a different knowledge source.\n\nThere was no discussion on the advantage of using Noisy-ORs.\n\nFinally, the group did not explicitly discuss inclusion in the transcription formalization.",
    "The discussion involved the system's role in demos, backups, and notes. Grad H detailed using THISL tools for information retrieval on meeting data, creating an index for queries, and displaying a list of hits with audio playback. There was discussion of merging the Transcriber and THISL IR interfaces. It was decided to have demonstrations ready by the end of the month.\n\nRegarding backups, Dave Johnson suggested keeping Meeting Recorder data on backed-up disks and using NW archive for copies. Burning CDs for backup was deemed impractical.\n\nFor notes, there was discussion about using CrossPads, PDAs, or having a scribe take notes. Professor B suggested scheduling periods for a scribe to listen to recordings and write down important points. Professor A thought summaries were a reasonable bootstrap into figuring out what queries to ask. He also suggested doing a word frequency count to see what words come up in different types of meetings.\n",
    "The discussion about HMRC revolved around the Welsh Government's decision to discontinue working with them on the childcare offer. Sian Gwenllian AM expressed frustration, noting the committee's previous scrutiny and concerns about the project.\n\nJulie Morgan AM explained that the decision was primarily driven by the desire for a more flexible and expandable childcare offer, which HMRC's involvement would have restricted. She also mentioned issues with HMRC's ability to fully comply with Welsh language standards, although this was presented as a secondary concern.\n\nJo-anne Daniels added that the costs presented by HMRC at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than initially outlined, making a local authority-based system more cost-effective and allowing investment to stay within Wales. Ultimately, the decision was made to work with local authorities instead of HMRC to deliver a more flexible and affordable system.\n",
    "Professor B commented that they wanted to get the linguists involved with the task. Professor B felt that Litonya was more present than she was in conversation.\n\nThe team felt that Lila sounded fine, was more present, and did a better job than expected. They also thought that giving her more instruments to work with would improve the results.\n\nThe required elements in the new form arrangement included numbering the items and making them clear.\n\nGrad A structured the belief net with dummy nodes called \"Trajector-In\" and \"Trajector-Out\" to isolate things related to the trajector. The team conceptually grouped nodes according to how they fit into image schemas, initially focusing on Trajector-landmark and Source-path-goal.\n\nGrad B and Grad A discussed that if they were to make the belief net real, then they would have to get rid of the dummy nodes and connect the concepts directly to the Mode. Grad B thought that a good start would be to informally think about what the decision variables are. Grad A understood that there were a lot of factors right now.\n",
    "Grad E and Grad A had differing opinions regarding the goals and outcomes of their experiments. Grad E was involved in improving the robustness of speech recognition under challenging conditions by combining different front-end representations. Grad E wanted to determine how strongly to train different pieces based on a reasonable criterion with hidden variables. Grad A focused on improving the back-end recognizer for the Aurora task by optimizing the HTK system. Grad A aimed to create more word-specific prototype HMMs and analyze the transition probabilities and expected durations of the models. Grad A's goal was to see how the models were training and if this was affected by the differences in the length of the words being analyzed.",
    "The User Interface team emphasized the importance of user-friendliness and trendiness in the remote control design. They suggested a combination of easy-to-use features with a modern design, focusing on a graphical user interface with symbols for easy understanding. Voice recognition was also considered as a potential feature.\n\nThe final decision leaned towards a minimalist approach with few buttons, a fancy look, and potential lighting effects, but not an LCD screen. A key feature was the inclusion of a \"find remote\" function, possibly through a beeping noise. \n\nThe team also discussed the potential for radio wave interference. The extra budget was considered for implementing fancy lighting techniques and voice recognition. The use of a low-cost circuit board was suggested to offset the costs of these elaborate features.\n",
    "Professor B expresses several thoughts on noise and its effects on speech. They suggest analyzing error types to see if noise reduction techniques improve certain aspects while worsening others. They discuss an experiment involving adding white noise at a level 15 dB below the utterance's maximum energy, which surprisingly smoothed MFCCs without significantly degrading speech recognition.\n\nThe professor posits that whitening the noise makes the training and testing conditions more similar, and while this is a form of smoothing, it primarily affects silence portions. Professor B also touches on FIR filters and suggests standardizing noise suppression methods, especially concerning LDA filters, to ensure consistency across experiments. The professor emphasizes that the goal is to deal with additive noise to improve speech recognition, but the methods for accomplishing this are still being explored.\n",
    "The group discussed the remote control's function as sending commands to the TV, including basic functions like on/off, channel changing, and volume control. The marketing team's research indicated that users primarily use remotes for channel surfing (98% of the time).\n\nThe kinetic function was discussed in terms of a joystick, with the default settings being up/down for volume and left/right for changing channels. The user interface team suggested two function buttons: a menu button and an \"OK\" button for navigating the LCD screen.\n\nThe ability to roll through favorite channels was not directly discussed, but it was mentioned that channel selection is the most frequent use of the remote, suggesting that the design should prioritize easy and efficient channel navigation. The joystick was proposed as a means to achieve this, offering a quick way to switch between channels.\n",
    "The team's proposed design for the remote control includes an ergonomic shape made of customizable wood, with a customizable color. Functionally, it will have an on/off button, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition, and an LCD screen on a flip panel. A customizable backing is also proposed.\n\nIndustrial Design and Marketing agreed on the prototype's appearance and design, aligning it with previous discussions.\n\nThe Industrial Designer suggested exploring online channels for promotion and ordering to reduce storage and transportation costs, leveraging the customizability of the product. Marketing agreed, suggesting that customers would have more ideas from viewing the product online.\n\nMarketing believes the product design aligns with their ideas and is satisfied with it. They emphasize the need for the company to evaluate its ability to capture enough of the market to justify production. Marketing also stated that speech recognition is a marketable aspect of the product design.\n",
    "Grad G thought it was important to get all this rolling so that they would actually have data. The professor thought that it doesn't hurt to have people wear the microphones properly, if possible. Grad A looked on Sony's for a replacement for the microphones for the head-worn ones, but she needed someone who knows more about microphones than she did. Fey was mentioned as someone who thought of the idea that the system should introduce itself when called. There was no mention of Grad G or the professor having any opinions on capturing the subject intention, MSG, or pronouncing zero.",
    "The Industrial Designer (ID) expressed several thoughts on the remote control's design and technology. Regarding appearance, the ID initially favored a titanium case for its trendy and modern look. However, after marketing survey results, the ID acknowledged the importance of a \"fancy look and feel\" and the potential of rubber material for a \"spongy\" texture with fruit/vegetable-like colors.\n\nConcerning technology, the ID supported speech recognition, emphasizing the need to integrate a microphone. They also mentioned a field programmable something array (FPGA) chip. They contrasted this with Bluetooth technology, clarifying that the FPGA chip handles functionalities while Bluetooth manages communication between devices. The ID also suggested a simple chip to reduce costs, which could allow the inclusion of features like speech recognition.\n\nRegarding new technologies, the ID was open to incorporating features like accessing the internet via television, anticipating future TV sets with internet capabilities. However, they were initially hesitant about LCD screens on the remote, citing cost concerns and suggesting that navigation could be achieved through the TV screen interface with minimal buttons.\n",
    "Priority of Inspections: The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois proposed giving priority and expedited processing to the files of refugee claimants, especially Haitian and Black individuals, who have expressed a desire to be part of the Quebec nation. Jassa Scott and Janet Finch-Saunders are not mentioned in this transcript.\n\nReopening of the House of Commons in Relation to Canada's Diplomatic Relations: Several members expressed frustration that Parliament was not considered an essential service and called for its reopening. Concerns were raised about the lack of oversight on government spending. It was mentioned that several countries had begun free trade negotiations with the United Kingdom, and questions were raised about Canada's plans.\n\nAllocation of Funds and Addressing Systematic Racism: Justin Trudeau acknowledged the existence of anti-Black racism and systemic discrimination in Canada and highlighted investments made to provide mental health services to those who have experienced racism. He mentioned the creation of the anti-racism secretariat with a budget of $4.6 million to address systemic barriers. He stated that racism has no place in Canada and that the government will do everything to eradicate it. Trudeau elaborated that the governmental fund is intended to address systemic barriers in employment, justice, and social participation. He emphasized the importance of working with opposition colleagues, community leaders, and Canadians to make the country more just and fair. The concept of a revolution in national institutions is not directly discussed.",
    "The group discussed the technical and functional designs of the remote control, emphasizing user-friendliness and compatibility. The functional design discussion included the remote's basic functions (power, channel, volume, mute) and compatibility with various devices (TV, DVD, VHS). The detailed design included the physical feel of the remote, button size, and battery type (double or triple A).\n\nThe prototype presentation included a smart chip for multi-functionality, a large on-off button, and a selection button for different devices. The discussion focused on simplifying the remote by minimizing the number of buttons and including voice recognition. Specific design requirements included incorporating the company color and logo. They also discussed the potential of including a feature to find the remote when lost, possibly through a beeping sound. They considered user preferences, such as larger buttons and a modern design. The group explored the possibility of accessing the internet via the television.\n",
    "The team's discussion revealed a project process hampered by a lack of clear direction and evolving goals. Initially, there was confusion about the product itself (remote control vs. coffee marketing vs. monitor design), highlighting a need for better communication and documentation from the project manager and marketing team.\n\nWork division suffered from a siloed approach, with team members primarily interacting during formal meetings and lacking informal communication channels. The industrial designer and user interface designer expressed frustration with the budget constraints imposed late in the design process, forcing compromises on desired features.\n\nThe production plan was criticized for its rigid structure and lack of collaborative brainstorming. Team members felt restricted by the tools and environment, which were perceived as hindering creativity and teamwork. They suggested earlier prototyping, more whiteboard-based collaboration, and a more relaxed, less structured environment to foster innovation. The team also noted a need for a less controlling and more empowering leadership approach.\n",
    "Future directions were discussed, focusing on the need to generate queries. The CrossPads were mentioned as a way to collect more information for UI design. It was decided that the group would try to use CrossPads if they could be obtained, and they would take digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting. The group also decided to ask people at the end of the meeting to mention something interesting they learned and to allow those willing to stay afterward and give an oral summary.\n\nPhD D explained the multilingual model, and PhD C and the professor discussed multiple languages and the need to ensure native speakers are recorded to build useful language models.\n\nFinally, the group discussed releasing meeting data and allowing people to cut things out. They decided to preserve time relations and use beeps to indicate removed sections, ensuring the cuts are obvious. The group also considered the need for a consistent licensing policy.\n",
    "Ms. Kwan's statement about the gap between program development and its implementation refers to the disconnect between creating programs and their actual effectiveness in addressing the needs of the people they are designed to help. This gap can arise from various factors, such as complex eligibility criteria, bureaucratic hurdles, or a lack of awareness among the intended beneficiaries. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this gap can have serious consequences, as delays or barriers in accessing support programs can exacerbate the economic and social hardships faced by vulnerable individuals and communities. Ms. Kwan's statement emphasizes the importance of ensuring that programs are not only well-designed but also effectively implemented and accessible to those who need them most.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the Project Manager seemed generally positive about the meeting reviews and the overall project progress. They felt the team had a satisfactory product that fit the budget and was trendy. However, they did express feeling ignorant during some explanations due to a lack of access to the same information as the other team members.\n\nThe group, however, seemed to have some reservations. They felt the process was tedious, especially the evaluation method. Some felt the level of information dropped off significantly, and there were concerns about the practicality of certain design elements.\n\nThe group's differing opinion likely stemmed from their direct involvement in the design and research process, giving them a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and limitations. The Project Manager, being more focused on the overall project goals and budget, might have had a less critical perspective.\n\nRegarding the panther drawing, the marketing member mentioned wanting to draw a panther because they wanted to be a panther as a child. The industrial designer questioned the ease of drawing a panther, while the user interface designer seemed indifferent. The conversation about the panther was brief and didn't result in a decision to use it in any designs.\n",
    "The team had varying opinions on the remote control features. The marketing expert's research indicated that users want a \"snazzy\" yet simple remote and are willing to pay more for it. They highlighted that users are generally unhappy with current remotes, finding them too complex and having too many buttons that are rarely used. They emphasized the importance of channel, volume, and power buttons, and suggested voice recognition as a desirable feature.\n\nThe user interface designer proposed incorporating a joystick and an LCD screen for additional functionality, drawing inspiration from game controllers and mobile phones. They suggested the joystick could control volume and channels by default, with the LCD screen displaying information and menus. However, there were concerns about potential confusion for users and the need to keep the design user-friendly.\n\nThe industrial designer focused on the internal components, suggesting a smart chip for multi-functionality, batteries for a power source, and a large on/off button for older users. They also considered the need for a \"homing device\" to easily locate the remote when lost. The team explored the possibility of a charging base with a button to make the remote beep for easy finding.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the tourism industry in Canada faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\n*   **Loss of Revenue:** Tourism businesses experienced substantial revenue declines due to travel restrictions and reduced demand.\n*   **Ineligibility for Support Programs:** Many tourism businesses, particularly those with seasonal operations or unique ownership structures, did not qualify for federal support programs like the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) or the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).\n*   **High Operating Costs:** Businesses faced increased costs to implement new health measures, such as purchasing PPE and modifying their facilities.\n*   **Border Restrictions:** Border closures significantly impacted tourism operators that rely on international visitors.\n\nThe government took several measures to mitigate the impact on the tourism industry, including:\n\n*   **Financial Assistance:** Provided financial support through programs like CEBA and CEWS.\n*   **Sector-Specific Support:** Allocated funding to regional development agencies to support tourism businesses and organizations.\n*   **Flexibility in Programs:** Introduced flexibility in eligibility criteria for some programs to accommodate the unique needs of tourism businesses.\n*   **Marketing Initiatives:** Encouraged domestic tourism through campaigns promoting local travel.",
    "The remote control design prioritizes user-friendliness and marketability within a 12.50 Euro production cost and a 25 Euro sales price.\n\n**Design:** The team favored a modern, eye-catching design with a reduced number of larger buttons that don't look like a normal remote. A large on/off button was deemed essential. The team will try to incorporate the company color and logo.\n\n**Energy Source:** The team discussed basic batteries and rechargeable lithium batteries.\n\n**Components:** The team determined the need for a plastic case for durability, a sophisticated chip for efficient operation, resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and resonators.\n\n**Functional Design:** The remote will primarily send messages to the TV, change channels, and control volume, with a strong emphasis on simplicity. Speech recognition was considered a \"star feature,\" pending cost and technical feasibility research.

    "The decision made regarding DARPA is not explicitly mentioned in the provided transcripts.\n\nThe paper in question is a summary of work done, including experiments with different neural networks (MLPs) trained on various databases. It explores the impact of delta features, training set size, and cross-language experiments on recognition accuracy. The paper also investigates combining different feature streams and using KLT transformations.\n\nThe statistics included in the paper involve recognition accuracy rates, often compared against a baseline performance (e.g., 82% accuracy for Italian mismatched digits). Error rates are also discussed, with attempts to reduce them through online normalization and neural networks. Specific numbers are presented for experiments on Aurora-2-B, TIMIT, SPINE, and various digit datasets, showing the effects of different training sets (French, Spanish, English, Italian), mismatched conditions (noise, microphone), and feature combinations (PLP, MSG).",
    "The group agreed to focus on testing three architectures for the digits corpus and possibly a fourth with a single KLT. Training and testing were being done for the TI-digits corpus, which was part of the development results. The current technique had limitations because the neural networks were trained on a language or specific task, which meant that the decision boundaries were not optimal for different tasks. Progress was being made in retraining the nets with new features and adjusting the on-line normalization. However, delays were encountered due to the amount of time required for training the neural nets and running HTK, as well as issues with the on-line normalization approach. The group planned to use multiple machines to speed up the process. There was also a delay with the silence detector because of the server side.",
    "The meeting transcripts do not include any discussion on the advantages of \"triple R\" over \"triple RC\" in the product's name.\n\nThe team decided to target younger people due to market research indicating their interest in modern remote controls. While the 46-65 age group represents a larger market share, the team believes a product designed for younger users can still appeal to older demographics due to its ease of use, while also securing a growing market. Voice recognition was also a feature that younger people were interested in.\n\nThe marketing team decided to target young people because they are interested in voice recognition options.\n\nThe discussion on channel selection revolved around whether to include teletext and how to navigate channels. Teletext was considered important for deaf users needing subtitles. For channel navigation, ideas included scroll buttons, joysticks, or a numeric keypad. The team considered that older consumers would need to adapt.\n",
    "The group discussed market research findings indicating that users are generally unhappy with existing remote controls. A significant portion, especially younger demographics, expressed interest in voice recognition. Simpler functions were favored, with primary uses being channel changing, volume control, and power.\n\nDesign opinions leaned towards a sleek, modern aesthetic, potentially using high-quality recycled plastic instead of metal to avoid interference and lawsuits. The user interface should be simple, with large, user-friendly buttons, potentially incorporating a touch screen with submenus for less frequently used functions.\n\nThe necessity of revolutionizing remote control interaction was a key theme. Ideas included a rechargeable internal battery with a docking station and a homing device to address the common issue of remotes getting lost. Voice recognition was considered as a way to cater to a younger demographic and potentially assist users with disabilities. The group explored the possibility of touch screen customization through downloadable skins, but this was deemed too complex and costly for the project's budget.",
    "Kirsty Williams AM emphasized a commitment to co-constructing the curriculum with the profession, focusing on refinement through workshops with quality improvement practitioners. She outlined plans to legislate for the four purposes, areas of learning and experience, cross-curricular aspects, and relationships and sexuality education (RSE), broadening the curriculum to include \"what matters\" statements and a statutory progression framework.\n\nBethan Owen highlighted the \"high-risk category\" for schools needing significant improvement, emphasizing the need for early identification and intervention, a concern echoed by the Chief Inspector.\n\nKirsty Williams explained five principles: strong leadership, excellent pedagogy, appropriate assessment, child well-being, and equity.\n\nNew examinations and school qualifications were expected to arise from the new curriculum, with Qualifications Wales leading a national conversation on reform.\n\nKirsty Williams responded to doubts about the sufficiency of their actions by emphasizing the flexibility afforded to teachers and the importance of the four enabling purposes (strong leadership, excellent pedagogy, appropriate assessment, and child well-being) surrounding the curriculum to ensure equity and success for all children.\n",
    "Based on the meeting transcripts, the team had mixed feelings about the production process.\n\n**Likes:**\n\n*   **Creativity:** Team members found the prototype making creatively stimulating, with room to explore ideas. Play-Doh was helpful in the creative process.\n*   **Teamwork:** Overall, the team felt they worked well together, though there were some reservations.\n*   **Technology:** Some team members thought the technology had been a help.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n*   **Constraints:** The budget constraints were a major source of frustration, forcing the team to cut features they liked, such as the solar cell and rubber casing. The team felt caged by the financial constraints.\n*   **Communication Barriers:** The team felt there were barriers to communication and collaboration. They wished they could more easily communicate outside of the meetings. The tools that they were given did not support collaboration. The structure in which the team approached the task was contrary to the principle of teamwork.\n*   **Meeting Structure:** Some felt the meetings were too structured and formal, hindering creative brainstorming. The atmosphere was relaxed, but the gear created boundaries.\n*   **Technology:** Some found the digital pens and PowerPoint presentations clunky and unhelpful.\n*   **Information Flow:** There were complaints about the information flow, with some team members feeling they lacked sufficient information or that the information was not always relevant.\n*   **Materials:** Some team members were disappointed that they could not get plastic and rubber.\n*   **Whiteboard/Microphones:** Some team members did not feel like getting up and down and dealing with all the wires.",
    "The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments focused on its implementation and effectiveness within the SmartKom system. Experiments were conducted using varying lengths of past speech (2-12 seconds) to calculate the mean for subtraction. Results showed that while a centered window of 12 seconds performed well, using only past data resulted in a slight performance drop. Training models with a 12-second mean subtraction but testing with shorter durations (2-6 seconds) had a minimal negative impact, suggesting some robustness.\n\nThe group also considered the possibility of filtering techniques and whether calculating the mean was the best method. One idea was to ramp up the mean calculation over time (2, 4, 6 seconds), but this could initially increase error rates in interactive systems. Caching utterances was suggested. A second pass was also suggested if the first pass did not have a long enough speech window to perform the mean subtraction. The group also discussed the impact of silence regions in the mean calculation and how to best handle them.",
    "The discussion covered several topics. Mixed signals were observed, with the SRI system showing better performance on some datasets (TI-digits) while the Aurora system performed better on others. VAD improvements were explored using energy-based methods combined with MLP-based methods, and the possibility of using the derivative of energy was also mentioned. VAD results indicated that the current VAD approach doesn't drop many frames for certain noises, and the boundaries provided might not be ideal.\n\nPostdoc A's opinion on new headphones wasn't explicitly mentioned in the transcript. Alternative methods to increase space were briefly discussed, with the idea of frame-dropping on the server side or sending all frames with a silence flag.\n\nThe deadline mentioned was related to Hynek's return from Europe and the desire to have a firm path for the work before he left on his next trip. There was also a discussion about a special topic section in Eurospeech on new corpora, with a deadline for submission.\n",
    "Special schools were highlighted as a successful sector. The schools that did not perform well tended to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Special schools are a successful sector in the annual report, as they have been over many years. The small number of schools that do not do quite as well tend to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties. \n\nWith regard to the PDG for looked-after children, there was some confusion about where the grant was, who had the grant, how it was spent, and what the priorities of regional consortia were because the grant goes to regional consortia now. The consortia are now using the grant, and there is some training being offered to schools around emotional behavior and attachment training. There is some school-to-school work that is now being funded by the grant to share best practice, and there are some individual bursaries to support the work.",
    "The User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager introduced a prototype idea during the meetings for a remote control that was ball-shaped. However, the Industrial Designer noted that a ball would roll and need a flat side for stability. The UI designer suggested a ball that could flip open with a hinge to reveal buttons, but this raised concerns about the hinge's durability.\n\nThe team discussed making the remote universal, aiming for a globally appealing product. The User Interface representative mentioned the difficulty of designing a truly universal remote due to varying specifications across electronic companies, suggesting focusing on TVs. They also discussed incorporating a tracking device, like a beeping function, to help users locate the remote. The Marketing Expert was tasked with researching the most universally appealing remote control designs, and the possibility of different designs for different target audiences was raised.\n",
    "During the discussions about the prototype's design and evaluation, the Industrial Designer provided several insightful comments. They emphasized the importance of simplicity and robustness in the components, favoring push buttons for their cost-effectiveness. The designer explored the possibility of combining plastic and rubber materials to achieve the desired feel and durability.\n\nRegarding customer preferences, the Industrial Designer acknowledged the marketing trend favoring a \"squishy fruitiness\" aesthetic. They contributed to brainstorming ways to incorporate fruit and vegetable shapes into the remote control design while ensuring it remained hand-holdable and functional. They also touched on the idea of different colors and patterns to represent various fruits, potentially offering interchangeable bases for users to switch between.\n",

They are planning to freeze the current version and work on other aspects of the system. The current system utilizes Wiener filtering on FFT bins for noise compensation, mel scaling, log application, LDA filtering, downsampling, DCT, on-line normalization, upsampling, and frame dropping.\n\nThe main areas needing improvement are a better voice activity detector (VAD), incorporating the neural net, and opening up the second front to utilize the full data rate. A mel spectrum will initially be used for the second stream. They also plan to improve the noise estimator.\n",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface (UI) designer and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price because the UI designer prioritized programming for the menus, while the Industrial Designer focused on using simple components to keep costs down. The UI designer felt additional programming expertise was needed, potentially increasing the price beyond the target budget, while the Industrial Designer aimed for a cheaper design.\n\nThe UI designer disagreed with the redesign after product evaluation, as the marketing team determined that the consumer wanted a fancy product with color and a spongy feel. The UI designer felt that the product was minimalist and simple, not fancy.\n\nThe UI designer suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because those were the company colors.\n\nThe marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance because the marketing team felt that the product should be in the shape of a fruit or vegetable.\n",
    "Kay Martin, Dafydd Evans, and Nick Brazil all participated in an evidence session regarding the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. Dafydd Evans stated that employers do not have a clear understanding of the Welsh bac and what it includes. He believes the title \"Skills Challenge Certificate\" is better and more easily understood. Nick Brazil echoed this sentiment, stating that employers he meets with through college employer boards rarely, if ever, mention the Welsh bac. Instead, they focus on professional qualifications and skills. He questions whether the demanding nature and bureaucracy of the Welsh bac are actually developing the skills employers need. Kay Martin confirmed that her experience is similar, with employers primarily seeking candidates with the right core qualification, such as engineering, alongside literacy, numeracy, and digital skills.",
    "The team discussed several additional ideas and presentations on the function and working design of the new remote control. The industrial designer suggested that the remote control change in size depending on the user's preference by being flexible and inflatable. They also proposed making it waterproof, and providing an oral cue to indicate when the remote has successfully transmitted a command.\n\nThe marketing representative suggested incorporating speech recognition, particularly for users aged 15-35 who are willing to pay more for trendy features. They proposed one-word recognition commands like \"remote\" to help users find the device, as well as basic commands like \"louder,\" \"softer,\" and \"change channel.\"\n\nThe user interface designer presented on user preferences, highlighting the need to minimize buttons, make frequently used buttons larger and strategically placed, and maintain a sleek and simple design. The team decided to begin with all features and eliminate them later in the design process.\n",
    "The Project Manager (PM) expressed several thoughts on the remote control project.\n\nRegarding the market, the PM noted that 40% of the market is comprised of people aged 46-65, making them the main profit source. They also emphasized the need to target a market above 40 that suits the remote control.\n\nOn price, the PM stressed keeping costs down, suggesting investing in design over high-tech materials. They also expressed concern about exceeding the 12.5 Euro budget, especially with features like touchscreens or docking stations. They seemed open to a universal remote concept if it could be achieved affordably.\n\nConcerning features, the PM was initially hesitant about Teletext but acknowledged its importance for some users. They were open to new features like a \"find my remote\" button. They were also wary of features increasing production costs.\n\nThe PM emphasized designing a remote specifically for younger customers but later suggested focusing on elderly people. They also suggested skipping Teletext due to the rise of the internet.\n",
    "User Interface's (UI) perspective on the cost constraints, financial targets, and the replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project was multifaceted. UI was open to titanium initially, influenced by the minimalist and shiny aesthetic of iPods, but recognized its potential costliness and futuristic feel, which might not align with the desired colorful and organic design. UI prioritized a simple, cost-effective interface, suggesting a plastic, yellow and black design with few buttons, corresponding to a screen displayed on the television.\n\nRegarding energy sources, UI found the kinetic energy concept attractive for its convenience and weight reduction, aligning with the idea of a lighter remote. However, UI emphasized the need to consider the cost, development effort, and research required for kinetic batteries. Overall, UI's approach aimed to balance innovation and user-friendliness with cost considerations.\n",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding future product ideas for a few reasons.\n\nMarketing emphasized that the remote control should have a \"fancy look and feel,\" prioritizing appearance over functionality based on market research. They suggested innovative elements that contribute to the aesthetic, such as lighting effects or themed covers.\n\nThe Industrial Designer, while appreciating the marketing aspect, had concerns about the practical implications of incorporating kinetic energy. They questioned whether users would want to shake their remote controls and suggested a hybrid approach with a battery backup. The Industrial Designer also brought up the point that making a titanium case would limit the design to a boxy shape.\n\nAlso, the marketing team emphasized that the rubberized covers are going to be relatively cheap to produce, and that if in a year's time the company gets feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming, it's so easy to just produce that and it can be slipped on.\n",
    "The committee discussed HEFCW's powers of intervention, particularly in light of HEFCW's concerns that these powers were inflexible and difficult to use for swift interventions. HEFCW representatives stated that they often relied on informal measures due to the cumbersome nature of formal sanctions.\n\nThe Minister acknowledged this feedback and expressed a desire for the new PCET commission to have a more graduated series of actions available, ranging from \"soft\" regulatory powers like advice and guidance to more punitive interventions in cases of quality concerns or financial failure. She emphasized the importance of balancing institutional autonomy with the need for accountability and the ability to deliver national outcomes.\n\nThe discussion also touched on specific instances where HEFCW had not used its powers of intervention, such as the situations at Swansea and Trinity St David universities. The Minister stated that she trusted HEFCW's professional judgment but expected them to use their full remit of powers if necessary.",
    "The group's marketing strategy revolves around creating a remote control that is trendy, user-friendly, and original to stand out on the shelves. The remote should be visually appealing, easy to use, and simple. They aim to design a product that people will immediately desire, regardless of its specific functions.\n\nTo achieve the expected profit of fifty million euros, the selling price of the remote control will be around twenty-five euros, with a maximum production cost of twelve euros and fifty cents. The group plans to target an international market, mainly in Europe and Northern America, and aims to sell at least four million units to reach their profit goal. The group's evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends. The group wants to have a product with a fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find in a room, and robust.\n",
    "The meeting transcript reveals no discussion about policies, measures, physical education, and food provision specifically for free-school-meal children during the pandemic. The discussion does include the new purpose of schools to provide safe and secure places for children of front-line responders and for vulnerable children to attend. It was also stated that schools would respond to the needs of children with additional learning needs. Free school meals were also a priority. It was stated that the schools and local authorities would develop plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response and then work out a longer-term plan. There was a discussion about the fact that Easter was approaching and that the goal was to provide ongoing provisions and not to make a distinction between term time and holiday time.",
    "User Interface considered a curved design for the keypad and ergonomic design to fit the hand better. They wanted an ergonomic design for both left and right-handed people, suggesting a double-curved design with articulation points. This would allow users to adjust the LCD and joystick to the appropriate position.\n\nThe agreement on \"easy to use\", \"fashion\", \"easy to find\", and \"robust\" features was based on market research indicating that customers prioritize a cool appearance over ease of use, but both are important. The \"easy to find\" feature was addressed with the idea of a tracking device or a noise-making function. Robustness was considered by suggesting materials like plastic, titanium, or a spongy rubber that could withstand drops.\n\nUser Interface evaluated the fashion style of the remote control by researching current trends. The initial trend identified was \"fruit and veg\" with a preference for spongy materials. However, concerns were raised about the longevity of this trend and the practicality of incorporating it into the remote's design.\n"
