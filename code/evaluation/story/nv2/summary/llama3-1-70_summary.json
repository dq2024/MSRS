The world is overcrowded, and the pressure of population has forced humans to explore and settle other planets. However, the only habitable planets are already populated, leading to the need for humans to negotiate with and eventually integrate with the native populations.\n\nTo address the issue of overpopulation, humans have established a system where they buy out and relocate the native populations of less populous worlds, allowing humans to settle and mix with the remaining native population. This process aims to create a mixed population that combines the strengths of both humans and the native species.\n\nThe Equalization Laws aim to promote equality and cooperation between humans and the native populations.

Initially, it represents a monumental task that the crew of the spaceship is determined to conquer, symbolizing humanity's innate drive for exploration and discovery. However, as the narrative progresses, the mountain becomes a metaphor for the characters' inner struggles and personal growth.\n\nOn one hand, the mountain embodies the harsh realities of survival on a distant planet, testing the crew's resolve, endurance, and teamwork. It also signifies the unbridgeable gap between the ideals of exploration and the brutal facts of existence in an inhospitable environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the mountain is also a psychological barrier, reflecting the characters' emotional states and relationships.
