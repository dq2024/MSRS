The narrative jumps between different characters, settings, and plotlines, creating a sense of disjointedness and fragmentation. However, upon closer examination, several key aspects of the societal structure emerge.\n\nAt its core, the society appears to be divided into distinct groups or classes, each with their own culture, values, and norms. The \"wipes\" and the \"laborers\" seem to be two separate entities, with the former being viewed with suspicion and hostility by the latter.

According to Pat Mead, the disease was \"pretty gruesome\" and caused the brain to dissolve and the body to fall apart. The doctors who tried to treat the disease died too soon to find out what it was or what to do about it, leaving the colony without medical expertise.
