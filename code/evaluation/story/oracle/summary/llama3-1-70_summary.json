The moon is divided into valleys, each with its own unique ecosystem and inhabitants. The story primarily occurs in one of these valleys, where the protagonist, Noork, navigates a jungle environment teeming with exotic flora and fauna.\n\nThe jungle is inhabited by various species, including the Vasads, a tribe of hairy, ape-like creatures, and the golden-skinned people of the valley cities, who are skilled hunters and gatherers.

They are tasked with guarding the temple and preventing escapes, but they are not invincible. Noork's discovery of their humanity and vulnerability serves as a turning point in the story, allowing him to devise a plan to rescue Tholon Sarna and ultimately escape the island.\n\nFurthermore, the Misty Ones' connection to the island and the temple is deeply rooted in the mythology of the world. They are seen as extensions of the priests' power and are feared by the slaves and common citizens. The revelation that they are human and can be defeated serves to undermine the authority of the priests and the temple, paving the way for Noork's ultimate triumph.\n\nIn addition, the Misty Ones' presence serves as a symbol of oppression and control. They embody the power dynamics at play on the island, where the priests wield absolute authority over the slaves and common citizens. Noork's ability to defeat them represents a challenge to this authority and a testament to his determination and resourcefulness.\n\nOverall, the Misty Ones are a crucial element in the narrative, serving as both antagonists and symbols of the oppressive forces that Noork must overcome to achieve his goals. Their presence drives the plot forward, and their defeat marks a significant victory for Noork and his companions.",

He has created a duplicate of Mary Alice, who believes it is 1933, and has been sending her notes and gifts through a secret means. He has also manipulated the environment to make her believe that time has stood still, using old newspapers, radio recordings, and other methods to create an illusion of a bygone era.

For instance, on Electra, it was forbidden to appear in public with bare hands, which became a universal prohibition. On Theemim, it was considered impolite to speak of eating in public, and on Zosma, it was tabu to appear in public without a head covering.

His experiences in Portyork exposed him to various cultures, customs, and ways of life, which initially fascinated and later overwhelmed him. The encounter with Pierce B. Carpenter, the aphrodisiacs salesman, served as a catalyst for Michael's realization of the intricacies and contradictions within the seemingly utopian society.\n\nAs Michael navigated the complexities of Portyork, he began to feel suffocated by the strict adherence to customs and tabus, which often seemed arbitrary and nonsensical. His interactions with various extraterrestrials and humans highlighted the challenges of communication and understanding in a multicultural environment. The Meropian's reaction to the word \"history\" and the subsequent explanation of the taboo surrounding it exemplified the difficulties of navigating the nuances of intergalactic relations.\n\nMichael's decision to return to the Brotherhood stems from his disillusionment with the societal expectations and norms he encountered. His desire for autonomy, individuality, and genuine human connection led him to reject the notion of sharing his partner, as mandated by the Universal principles. This choice symbolizes his preference for a simpler, more authentic way of life, untainted by the complexities and superficialities of the cosmopolitan society.\n\nThe trip back, therefore, represents a symbolic retreat from the chaos and artifice of the external world, marking Michael's reconnection with his roots and his aspiration for a more meaningful, uncomplicated existence.

    " The relationship between Michael and Mr. Carpenter is complex and multifaceted. On the surface, Mr. Carpenter appears to be a friendly and helpful guide, assisting Michael in navigating the complexities of the diverse and unfamiliar society of Portyork. However, as their interactions progress, it becomes apparent that Mr. Carpenter is also a symbol of the societal norms and expectations that Michael is struggling to adapt to.\n\nMr. Carpenter represents the epitome of the Universal values and customs that Michael is expected to conform to. He is patient and willing to explain the intricacies of the society to Michael, but at the same time, he is also quick to reprimand Michael for his mistakes and misunderstandings. This dynamic creates tension between the two characters, as Michael struggles to balance his desire for independence and individuality with the need to conform to the societal norms.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Carpenter's character serves as a foil to Michael's, highlighting their differences in background, values, and worldview. While Michael is a product of the Brotherhood, a community that values simplicity and tradition, Mr. Carpenter embodies the cosmopolitan and progressive ideals of the Universal society. This contrast underscores the difficulties Michael faces in adapting to a society that is fundamentally at odds with his own upbringing and values.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between Michael and Mr. Carpenter reflects the central conflict of the story: the tension between tradition and progress, individuality and conformity, and the challenges of navigating a complex and rapidly changing society. As Michael navigates this treacherous landscape, his interactions with Mr. Carpenter serve as a catalyst for his growth, forcing him to confront the limitations of his own worldview and the consequences of his choices.",

The disease was described as \"pretty gruesome\" by Patrick's father, and the doctors who tried to treat it died too soon to find out what it was or what to do about it. The true nature of the disease is later revealed to be a result of the adaptation process initiated by Alexander P. Mead, who modified human cells to absorb Minos' indigestible food. The process involved turning human cells into phagocytes, subjecting them to a harsh environment, and then implanting them back into the people. This process allowed the Meads to digest Minos' food, but it also made them vulnerable to a unique disease that attacked the adapted cells.
