The animal is described as having a humanoid appearance, with a cream-colored robe flowing from its back and a red sash around its middle.

Initially, they appear to be invisible and possess magical abilities, striking fear into the hearts of the characters. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Misty Ones are actually human beings, dressed in hooded robes, who serve as guardians of the island and the Temple of the Skull.\n\nTheir role is multifaceted, as they are both the antagonists and the pawns in the conflict between the protagonists and the forces of darkness. On one hand, they are the primary obstacles that the heroes must overcome to achieve their goals. On the other hand, they are also victims of the evil forces that seek to exploit and control the island and its inhabitants.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the Misty Ones are portrayed as being both formidable and vulnerable. They possess a certain mystique and are capable of inspiring fear and awe in those who encounter them. However, they are also shown to be susceptible to injury and death, as evidenced by Noork's ability to kill one of them and Gurn's plan to trap and skin them.\n\nUltimately, the Misty Ones serve as a symbol of the unknown, the \"other,\" and the fears that lie at the heart of human nature.

The legend of the Ghost Ship, a vessel said to haunt the Solar System, serves as a symbol of his own fate - a spaceman who can never return home. The ship's presence is a manifestation of Willard's deepest fears and desires, representing the possibility of rescue and reunion with humanity.\n\nThroughout the story, memories blur the lines between reality and fantasy, making it difficult for Willard (and the reader) to distinguish between what is real and what is imagined.

It provides a space for people to shed their inhibitions and immerse themselves in a world of fantasy and abandon. The club caters to a clientele with disposable income, a desire for self-abandonment, and the means to indulge in illicit activities, such as self-telportation.\n\nWithin this context, the Riverside Club represents a realm where individuals can temporarily forget their troubles and immerse themselves in a world of hedonism and fantasy. The club's extravagant decor, complete with shifting lights and mirrors, creates an immersive atmosphere that transports patrons to a realm of escapism. The presence of masks and elaborate costumes further reinforces this notion, allowing individuals to assume alternate identities and momentarily escape the constraints of their everyday lives.\n\nHowever, beneath the surface-level allure of the club, it is evident that the patrons are struggling with their own personal demons.
